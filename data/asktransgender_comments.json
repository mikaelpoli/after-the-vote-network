There are some things like that that generally get said they happen early on on T, but I've found many of those things for myself to not really happen at their highest until some years in. It was maybe 4 years before I was extra hungry all the time. It was maybe 5-6 years in until my libido spiked quite higher than it had been before. Etc. Yet all my other changes happened at the same average pace that they tend to happen at for most people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Go figure lol.\n\nHas he changed anything about his lifestyle recently? If he's exercising more, working out more, started playing sports, etc, then that could make him hungrier.\n\nThe amount he eats sounds like me, though not all in one sitting, but more like I'll have a second and third meal for every meal lol. My day is often like breakfast, brunch, second brunch, first lunch, second lunch, third lunch, snacktime, first dinner, second dinner, third dinner, midnight teatime, 2am snack. The amount he ate for dinner is the amount I might eat for first, second, and third dinner, each one being 1-2 hours apart from each other. I'm almost 9 years on T, and tbh don't deliberately exercise or workout, I'm just often hungry every 2-3 hours lol. If I'm going to hang out with a friend, it's not enough to just eat a snack before I leave. Even if I eat a whole meal before leaving, 1.5hrs into our hang and my stomach is growling. I'm so annoying now and insist every time I hang out with anyone that it either be at a cafe, or that it start or end at a cafe, always needs to involve a cafe. I was never hungry so much like this for the first half of my time on T, but around maybe 4-5 years in it was starting to get like this, and at 6-7 it seemed to peak, I was living with my parents at the time and my mom noticed I was eating a lot too. Now almost 9 years in, and I feel like it's starting to very slowly gradually taper away from that again."

But if he's gonna keep doing pot he might want to at least set up a way to keep himself away from his car keys while he's high.\n\nOther than that, this is definitely one of the best possible outcomes, and at least you found out about this possible problem before it went badly..."

It's not always a puberty thing.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if there's weird or unexpected reasons he might need more energy.\n\nFor example, I'm a wheelchair user and I tend to need a lot of food because my body burns more fuel, since our bodies evolved to handle walking, not using a wheelchair."

I started transition at 32, and while the referral process has been held up and it's been one strange set of medical conditions over my life, as I'm waiting in suspense to be able to see a specialized intersex endocrinologist, the results of the karyotyping and reproductive scans won't really change anything except my medical care. I still had to live a long time as an AMAB adult \"man\" (even more difficult not having much androgen activity) anyway and will forever carry the mental burden of the experience. I transitioned fairly thoroughly and settled into a life otherwise typical of cis women, and the results of testing won't make me more or less of anything except on a technicality.  \n\nYou're lucky that you found out so early and didn't really have to live as an adult man at all, but you're still going to have a similar history that will forever be with you. Even your interests sound shaped by being made to live as male. Your friend group and teenage experience was probably more male-aligned as well. Your overall experience wouldn't be much different than most other trans girls that transitioned in their late teens - you just may have less androgenization to want to deal with. Intersex trans people are just as trans as endosex trans people, and it sounds like you still had to transition. It's still big news, and still an absolute mindfuck to have to internalize that most people won't understand, but it doesn't functionally change much.  \n\nYou should also know how \"biological\" girl doesn't make sense in this context and usually is a transphobic dogwhistle. All trans girls are biological girls. What you found out would be that you're a chromosomatic female. You may want to also start talking to some people on r/intersex and maybe join their Discord for support. They're some of the only places you'll be able to get help with some intersex-specific health issues that you may have to figure out."

I'm also very disheartened that you weren't informed of your sex as a child and you had to go through all that anguish, which undoubtedly affected your sense of self and well-being. I think your experience definitely mirrors trans experiences, and you can feel free to call yourself what you want. Labels are helpful, but they aren't everything. I wish you all of the luck with your journey moving forward and I hope you continue to experience gender euphoria!"

But after this recent discovery and my feelings of discontent. I'm pissed LOL my body's been pretty androgynous I have a slight beard growth but that was about it from male puberty. I've always had very small genitalia and it was a point of concern for when I identified masculine. But I think the reason I'm using biological is because that's what turfs always complain about but yeah I still have to technically transition and socially most people refer to me as male even though I'm very androgynous.

I will be real with you I had a lot of concern about my \"male equipment\" because it never really grew big per say I was always under developed I also suffered from gynecomastia during puberty so I had a lot of body image issues. But when I first started HRT after like 2 months I began to see a lot of changes I put on weight real quickly and I went to the more typical places you'd expect but I had breast buds after the first month it scared me really bad mostly because I was unsure about my identity at the time and I didn't want to change that fast. So I stopped then I went through a period of hyper-masculinity LOL does not suit me well. But for the mental aspect the first time I was on HRT I was going through too many emotions to really appreciate it but now after being on HRT for 6 months I feel a sense of clarity I've never felt before. If that makes sense. But a little side note I went to my family doctor for my HRT prescription they didn't tell me about my intersex diagnosis because my parents told them to withhold it we've been calling the same damn doctor for like 12 years. So I'm looking for a new endocrinologist. To make sure I'm not screwing anything up because I don't think I need as much spiral lactone as I'm currently taking."

My supportive specialist confirmed no intersex variations prior to my taking HRT, and a genetic test of mine was able to access my Y chromosome.\n\n\nHere's something noone can take from you: when men are exposed to our levels of Estradiol and Testosterone, it causes them depression and often other symptoms like anger.\n\n\nIf you were \"just biologically male\", and you're on HRT, then you should be suffering from strongly negative symptoms due to it.\n\n\nI should probably be wanting to kill myself, if I'm \"just biologically male\". I've induced breast growth, wrecked my ability to get hard, ruined a perfectly healthy, 100% male body.\n\n\nGuess what? I don't feel ruined, I feel way better about my body. My mental health is more stable. My desire to live has gotten WAY stronger. None of these effects make any sense if I'm \"just biologically male\".\n\n\nHopefully that helps?"

But I have a pretty small penis... Apparently I had a vaginal opening that was slightly under my scrotum. I've had a scar there but I just thought I had a weird sack. But it was not a fully closed labia is what I believe I'm no doctor and I kind of suck at terminology. But what I'm to believe is that my parents made the decision to close the opening and raise me more as a boy. The doctor assumed that my testes were functional. After talking with my auntie apparently my parents had the choice to not do anything and wait but they can be a little intolerant to out of the norm stuff and wanted me to be fixed immediately. I think my mother has come around a little because she's being supportive now and she regrets her decision. But my father is very stubborn and thanks that since I had a somewhat penis that means I should just man up. I don't have many complications other than not being able to hold my pee as well as others causing me to leak sometimes ironically I've started wearing pads for it mostly when I exercise. That's why I'm seeing a specialist to see if there's a possibility of having a semi-functional vaginal canal after surgery. Because I can feel a pocket almost an emptiness where one should be it's just kind of tight down there LOL."

If they refuse to get into the topic or say there's nothing going on, then let them retreat. You can let them know you'd be supportive or open to the possibility, but ultimately the horse has got to drink on its own.\n\nAside from that, you can support or encourage your partner in doing feminine things, or treating them in feminine ways.

    "comment_body": "That does sound very much like gender dysphoria. You're right. They could very well be trans.\n\nTell them that they can just be a girl. Try not to make a big deal out of it, even though it sounds like one. One of the main things keeping trans people in denial is a fear of change. Because it feels like such a drastic measure. I think you should just wait for the next time they say something like \"I wanna be a girl so bad\" (ideally not when they're drunk though) and just casually tell them something like, \"You can be, you know? You wouldn't be the first to that. Trans people can do it, after all.\"\n\nThey will almost certainly reject this, of course. Citing doubts, like not having gender dysphoria (they probably do have it. It's just not something as obvious as people think), or fear of not being pretty enough post transition (they likely will be pretty. HRT is surprisingly powerful. Also, if that is their main concern, they are 100% trans), or just attempt to remain in complacency because of their fear of change, saying things like \"I can just live my life normally, it's not a big deal\". In all of these cases, but especially the last one, it is important you make it clear to them that you'll be there to give them support. And unless they specifically tell you \"I don't want this\" you should keep trying to gently remind them of that.\n\nThis isn't a decision that needs to be made now, but it's better not to have them push this away. Go into support forums like this one with them. Maybe show them your post and read the comments together. Change IS scary. But it's a lot easier when you see other people doing it too."

Sex related to the biological sex organs that your body has, while gender is a very loose and messy concept that is entirely based on how one perceives themselves. What you likely mean is that you can't change your sex (without various surgeries and operations). I can't speak for the actual trans people here but I imagine that they relate this story with their own and others' experiences. I imagine it's similar to a doctor for whatever sickness you have before they run any tests, just experience with different stories, conditions, etc and being able to relate symptoms with various diagnoses. \n\nTrans people do correct me, as I am speaking for you so tell me if I got anything wrong and I'll edit my comment to correct any mistake I may have made."

Nothing in the world can fake sincere care and concern forever so practice real care for her needs. Really try to understand.\n\nAs a woman who experienced being a teenage \"boy\" running on testosterone who liked a girl and really wanted to impress her, I recognize exactly that in how you talk about her and even automatically show off your martial art skills in a reddit post she probably won't see. I've been there. If you really want to impress her, don't look to other teenage boys and how they show off. They're inexperienced and their confidence is fake. Look at adults who have the experience to be confident without needing to show off. Their confidence is internal and based on experience.\n\nThis is new and exciting so let yourself be excited and maybe even show off and make a fool of yourself sometimes. It's part of the fun but remember if you set out to over time build the real confidence and kindness she deserves you might find you are both better off whatever happens."

This is definitely a tricky situation to be in-- for both of you, I might add. \n\nOthers have already addressed the language and you seem to have received their feedback, so I won't touch on that. As far as I can tell, you're on board with the fact that she is a girl, so you're already halfway there and this is mostly a communication issue :). \n\nI agree with some others who have said that this may have caused her to panic if she felt like you were \"calling her out\" on being trans. Many trans women are afraid of this exact situation leading to violence at the hands of men who feel lied to. Also, it was really shitty of her sister to out her to you, so she could have been upset about that. \nI wonder how you approached this. Your post says you \"confronted\" her-- whether you meant to or not, is it possible you came off as combative or accusatory? She may have been trying not to tell you until she had to (when you two have sex, basically), for whatever reason. It could be that she doesn't want to draw attention to the fact, or that she was worried about how you reacted, or any other reason. Really,  it's her thing to tell you, when she was ready. \n\n Also, I think you already know this, but I really want to underscore it: she didn't do anything wrong. She was under no obligation to tell you. What's in her pants has no bearing on your relationship, so there was no need for her to bring it up.\n\nSo what's the next step? Ideally you wouldn't have mentioned anything until she told you herself, but what's done is done, nothing to do there. If I were in her shoes, I would want space to process. Being outed like that can be a really big deal and she's probably feeling a lot of different things right now. With that said, I think it could also go a long way to text her something and basically just tell her what you've told us here:\n- you see her as a girl, regardless of whether she's trans or not\n- you weren't trying to hurt her when you mentioned it, you just wanted to learn more about her (maybe apologize if you did make her feel called out)\n- you would still like to date her and this doesn't change anything\n- you will support her any way you can. \nThen after that, I don't think there's much you can do. Give her space and let her figure this out, but tell her you're ready to talk and keep dating her whenever she's ready.\n\nIn the meantime, it would never hurt to do some learning on trans people. You've already taken the first steps here, but browsing queer Reddit communities is one way, and there's tons of resources out there online. Just be careful not to fall into transphobic rabbitholes, which are unfortunately more common than you'd like to think. \n\nGood luck :)"

You spend a lot of time teaching haha.¬†\n\n\nMaybe look up some practical resources, documentaries, that sort of thing ((and advice on here with a LOT of salt) that way she's not spending so much time explaining a lot to you all the time?

There's something in your gut that tells you it makes sense for her to be a her.

Those 1-3% of women aren't doing anything \"right\" or \"wrong,\" it likely just comes down to some degree of luck. \n\nI don't know when you transitioned and started presenting femme, but age is also a huge factor when it comes to sexual harassment. Many women report that they started getting catcalled at a very young age, and it drops off significantly once they are visibly no longer children. This ties into how sexual harassment and assault is not really about attraction, but about exerting power over another person: if harassment is meant to scare someone, it's a lot easier to scare a young girl than a grown woman, and a grown woman is more likely to bite back in some way."

Can we change our primary sex characteristics to perfectly match a cis person's? No, not yet anyway. Then again, neither could a cis person change theirs to perfectly match another cis person's of the same gender. \n\nChromosomes aren't used to categorize sex anywhere in biology, they're just how our bodies figure out how we should grow. Otherwise intersex folk would be considered different sexes entirely. We can use hormones to grow differently, making chromosomes irrelevant to the sex discussion.\n\nYou mention that bottom surgery is \"genital origami\", but have you looked into what the **actual** differences are between the male and female bodies are? Life is just \"genital origami\". A cis woman's clitoris could just as easily have been a penis had things developed a little differently. A cis man's testicles would have developed into ovaries if not actively overwritten in the womb. The reason gender affirming surgeries tend to work so well on trans women is because the tissue down there is trying to act like a vulva when you're on HRT anyway. \n\nWith all of this being said, my take is that \"transsexual\" as a term isn't great because sex is irrelevant to these discussions anyway. Gender is all anybody really cares about at the end of the day. When people THINK they care about sex, what they actually care about is gender expression, which with the state of medical care today can often be the same thing. Sex matters to trans folk as a source of dysphoria I suppose, but if we abolished sex as a concept tomorrow we'd still have trans people, so I really think sex isn't the point. Also the term \"transsexual\" took on a sexuality meaning at some point (probably Blanchard thanks king), so distancing sexuality from gender & sex discussion feels like a good thing overall."

Even when you are by yourself so you can get used to it. 19 years of saying \"he\" is a hard habit to break .\n\nDoes she want to be called a different name? Change it in your phone. Practice so that it becomes second nature. \n\nHelp her get proper gender affirming care. Does she have a general practicioner or family doctor that can prescribe HRT? Does she want this?\n\nHow is she overall? Would she like to speak to a therapist? (My daughter found this really helpful,  she did it for the 1st year she was out.  We found her a trans therapist).\n\nDoes she have a peer support group? Would she like one? In larger cities community centre's may have LGBTQ social and support groups for youth.\n\nLastly, would you like to connect to other parents? PFLAG has chapters across North America,  check them out.\n\nThere's also a sub called CisParentTransChild\n\nYou sound like a loving, caring Dad. It's going to be alright!"

Using the pronouns she wants you to use.  Telling her you love and want to help her through her coming out and transitioning.\n\nMy advice. \n\nKeep loving her as you always have.\n\nDon‚Äôt make a big deal if you accidentally misgender her or use her old name.  Correct yourself and move on.  Don‚Äôt focus on constantly apologizing or apologizing many times.  It may seem comforting to you, but it tends to make a transgender person to feel like they are not who they are.\n\nNever use her dead name, assuming she has told you her preferred name.\n\nAsk her how you should introduce her to people when you are together.  Don‚Äôt assume she wants people to know she is transitioning or that she has told everyone in her life.\n\nDo not tell anyone she is transitioning.  It is potentially dangerous for her.  Also it is not your place to do so.  It is her story to tell.\n\nOffer to help her build up a wardrobe or take her up to buy some make up.\n\nIf she still lives with you, ask if there is anything special she wants for her room.\n\nBuy her a Bl√•haj at IKEA!  It is the large snuggly shark that really connects with those who are transgender.  I have two myself and I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs.\n\nAlso don‚Äôt ask about deeply personal things like are you going to go through gender affirming surgery unless they say it is alright to ask.\n\nMost importantly, treat her as you would any other female person in your family.\n\nAlso feel free to DM me if you have any other questions.  Like I said, I went through this very same thing two years ago with my 19 year old, and we have a great relationship."

Sometimes she may not feel like she can wear women's clothes out or even use their true pronouns. Don't have expectations or comment on it, except to ask if they need anything. \n\n2.

And there are hints there concerning looking for a gender therapist in case.\n\nAnd treatment until puberty usually is only social, like changes to presentation and pronouns etc. In puberty adding blockers would be recommendable. They just stop a development towards the gender assigned at birth. It would be reversible in case. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/explaining/index#wiki_blockers) might be a number of explaining resources. And after puberty HRT may be an option.

It‚Äôs a long journey for the parents with lots of different emotions but when one takes the time to feel their own feelings and taking extra time for self-care it truly can make all the difference. Really allow all the thoughts and feelings and don‚Äôt try to delete them because you feel ashamed of them or something like that. In the end I‚Äôm talking about finding joy, pride, things to celebrate and appreciate in both the trans identities and also in  being a parent for someone with trans experience. \n\nI feel you are making good choices. One of them is getting educated like you are doing here. It‚Äôs so important not to use one‚Äôs kid as the educator or the therapist but just let them live their life and being there for them. If you want to support your daughter to see a therapist make sure they‚Äôre affirming and the focus is on ‚Äùsupport with minority stress‚Äù/something similar vs. ‚Äùtherapy because being trans‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure you get the picture. \n\nIn this political climate (if you‚Äôre in the US) I suggest you also start to think about the situation in your state. (Check hrc.org, translegislation.org and Erin Reed, to name a few.) Healthcare, discrimination, safety. \n\nThink about how to support your daughter when she is not in the room; you can take these supportive steps even in more general conversations about human rights themes and thus making a difference in people‚Äôs attitudes. Unfortunately the times are difficult and my feeling is that we can‚Äôt afford NOT to be politically active if we want a future for the younger LGBTQIA+ generation. We don‚Äôt have the luxury to live in isolation but are part of this world. Getting your own tribe, safe bubble, supportive network is crucial so that you‚Äôll have the energy to be an ally in different situations. \n\nFind your own ways to take action and let your daughter know (show her) that there are active things that you do to make the world better for her and other LGBTQIA+ folks. I would count more on showing your behavior instead of words explaining. \n\nI feel you really are doing great and my comment is trying to challenge you further, if you have that energy."

An example is he said \"I don't know how I'm going to see you as a girl if your voice doesn't change, will hormones do that?\"  \n\n\nInstead ask questions with positive curiosity, like \"What changes can I expect to see in you on hormones? I'm so excited to get to see the real you.\" \n\nThe way things are phrased can make a big difference.\n\nOh and for the record, you sound like an incredible dad. Thank you so much for accepting your daughter. Her road will be tough for a little while so she may not always express it but I guarantee she loves you more now than she ever has before in her life."

Homophobia is disgusting. You feel personally offended by his homophobia because it's disgusting and you're gay and nobody likes feeling like they're disgusting for existing.\n\n-The flavor of legislation he's proposing has existed in the past and still exists in some areas, it's called the Trans Panic Defense (akin to the Gay Panic  Defense), where it is \"defensible\" to murder someone you've had sexual contact with after finding out they are trans. Obviously that's disgusting. He's proposing a sort of expansion of that that legislated what trans people must say and do and when in order to be \"allowed\" to exist. That level of authoritarianism is insane (and disgusting).\n\n-The absolute metal gymnastics for him to suddenly become \"disgusted\" when nothing actually changed is incredible. It feels hypocritical from the perspective of someone like you or I who don't have such visceral internal hate for whole groups of people for no reason.\n\n-The audacity of him to treat her as if she's disgusting and then turn around and say he treats trans people with respect (when we only know of one trans person he's interacted with and he has very much failed to treat her with respect) is disgusting.\n\nTL;DR he's disgusting and his behavior is disgusting."

This man has perpetuated this, despite having been perfectly happy and unaffected during the intimate act, much like that trans girl was until she had to experience the same thing she's likely experienced plenty before, for having to tell him, lest she end up worse off. He gets off scott free being a twat amongst his community, and she continues to suffer with only her community to relieve her a bit. There's no winning. \n\nSorry for the rant. Just fell out of me."

THIS IS ASSAULT!\" same vibes.\n\nAlso, just a quick note on your post: You did NOT find out the man you kissed has a vagina. You just found out he was trans. You do not know which genitals trans people have unless they tell you, or you see them. Same actually applies to cis people, though they tend to not get bottom surgery unless they literally lose their genitals.\n\n  \nAnyway, I think it bothers you that cis men are calling this deception, because it implies that she tried to make him gay. Because as soon as she disclosed her medical history to him, he stopped seeing the woman in front of him, and projected an image onto her of something she is not. He deceived himself to protect his fragile toxic masculinity and the idea that he could ever like someone with THAT medical history, who can't be a babymaking submissive homemaker.\n\nIn reality, trans women are women, trans men are men, and enbies are enbies. If anything, this is the opposite of deception. She was up front, told him about her PRIVATE MEDICAL HISTORY before going anywhere near actual intimacy. She was literally more truthful than most people would be on a first date/romantic experience with someone else.\n\n  \nShe was a saint, and he is acting like somebody spent the evening punching him in his tiny shrivelled nuts, further flattening his flaccid little ego of a mental micropenis.\n\n  \nMany cishet men act like the LGBTQ+ community are obsessed with labels. In reality, it's quite the opposite. They're so incredibly obsessed with the labels of \"masculinity\" and \"straight\" that even the smallest \"rocking of the boat\" (even if based on misinformation or simply internalized issues) will send them into a projection panic, making them scream foul play and tricks at anyone who wants to listen. \"I didn't kiss a man, I didn't! I have no interest in penises, I promise! I wasn't attracted to her at all, or I mean him, I mean her, DAMNIT - I COULD TELL! I KNEW- No wait I didn't know, I didn't! I'm not gay! \\*tiny violin\\*\".\n\nThe fragile, fragile ego of a man so obsessed with his label that any experience HE deems a threat to it, is an assault upon his character and morals."

For instance - you buy a girl a drink, she‚Äôs gotta kiss you at least. You buy her dinner, she has to come home with ya. That sort of thing. It‚Äôs a very selfish sort of stand point where you centre everything as a transaction. You put in X and expect Y to result. Only your desires, needs, and expectations matter. Someone else‚Äôs desires are fine as long as they align with yours. \n\nHomophobia and transphobia go hand in hand with this. The man‚Äôs bought her a drink and kissed her, so now he‚Äôs expecting to fuck‚Ä¶ and expecting a specific kind of sex, too. If it‚Äôs not the specific result he expects, he gets mad. If she isn‚Äôt the person he expected, he gets mad. And if she has a different configuration of genitals that he thinks makes him ‚Äúgay‚Äù or ‚Äúqueer‚Äù - which means he‚Äôs not at the top of the social pyramid by being a real man, a cishet man - he‚Äôs mad. \n\nWe think differently as queer people. Yes, of course there are wonderfully nice cishet men, and awful cis and trans men, but the basic idea is that queerness itself removes a certain type of expectation. Sure, you flirt and you kiss, but are you expecting the person to drop trou and be miraculously prepped for anal sex? Not really. Not always. The basic expectation is different. It‚Äôs what makes us more likely to kiss someone, find out they‚Äôre trans, and go along with it or, yknow, not bash someone upon finding out. \n\nIn any case, I disclose that I‚Äôm trans on my Grindr profile. I don‚Äôt want to take any risks, despite the risk of being outed that I‚Äôm similarly gambling on. There‚Äôs been a lot of heavy stuff here in this comment and this post, but I want to end off by saying that ultimately - we get by. We‚Äôll survive and find ways to thrive. ü´Ç"

That is to say that just because someone dates women doesn't mean that they need to feel attracted to all women, some of us have penises while others don't. \n\nFor straight people looking to start their own family I really can't blame them if they'd lose interest when discovering someone is trans because it creates big logistical issues regarding family planning. I do hold the same reservations on the opposite end and I hate the internal conflict that comes with it. \n\nThere's a lot of guys out there that I find cute and sweet but simultaneously I can never give them kids so dating most men seems like a pipe dream tbh. I'm probably never going to date a guy because of that sole reason unless he'd happen to be trans too and would be comfortable trying for kids.\n\nThe real issue is if someone doesn't consider trans people as their identified gender for whatever reason such as their type of genitals. So for example seeing us trans women as men simply because we've got a different set of genitals from cis women. In this situation though I'm not getting good vibes because that guy got \"disgusted\" for no other reason other than the person he kissed was trans. \n\nIf all variables are ok for someone and their view only changes after discovering someone's trans (and it's got nothing to do with genitals themselves) then yeah that's transphobic because they don't view the person as their identified gender.

Seriously yall all called us liars and deceivers over shit like this. Complain when we use your dating apps. Complain when we use your sexuality labels in ways yall don‚Äôt like. Complain when we look too attractive to you. Complain when we talk about this ish yall put us through when it comes to dating \n\nFrankly I‚Äôd only fuck with a cis person after I had them sign some iron clad contract that they do in fact know I‚Äôm trans and won‚Äôt try to kill me and claim I tricked them or something later.

Genital preferences are one thing and that's fine but that shouldn't be an issue on the 1st date. I fully believe that unless ur about to have sex u shouldn't have to disclose that, and if u had the bottom surgerys u shouldn't have to disclose it full stop."

It's not worth any individual's time, effort, or concern to try and persuade these people otherwise. I've tried, and succeed about 1% of the time, tops, so it really is just a colossal waste of spoons.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to disclose their medical history to randos on the street just to soothe their fragile self-image. If their identity is so easily challenged, that's their problem, not ours. Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Straight doesn't really mean as much as it used to, because people don't conform to binary gender presentation as strictly these days. It's beautiful. The world is so much more interesting for it.\n\nA better law would be mandatory gay make-out sessions for all, so people can get past this bullshit through exposure therapy."

I don't agree with trans panic or gay panic and I pray they never allow it in the future since at that point either your starting something (removal of consent before act) and parties go their own way, or you've already had the intimacy (can't hide the fact there are 2 penises and went through with it anyway (concent).  It's a BS defense, same kind to get rapists and murder sentence reduction."

I think it's justified to assume that someone interested in you wouldn't be hateful or transphobic, though it might be wishful thinking. On the other hand, it's not justified to assume that the person you're pursuing is cis when you literally have no idea. If he's that transphobic, then he should be upfront about that before engaging intimately with anyone, regardless of whether he thinks they \"look like a woman\" or not."

But would these people say that same thing about a racist white man who only wants pale, white women who are US citizens? What if that man came across a girl who looked like Rachel Zegler in the club, kissed her, and then she revealed to him later in conversation that she's not a US citizen, she's Colombian and recently immigrated to the US. She just has pale skin for a Latina so he thought she was white. Is it also \"just preference\" for him to be absolutely disgusted by the fact that \"she deceived me into thinking she's white!\" when all she did was exist in that space and then HE approached HER? She didn't \"deceive you\" you racist prick! YOU assumed wrong! What reason would she have to suspect that a man WHO APPROACHED HER has confused her for a white woman and is actually a racist, hateful bigot? Why would she assume \"oh he probably thinks I'm something I'm not even though he's looking right at me and really likes me, and he'd probably be absolutely DISGUSTED with me if he knew I'm a non-white immigrant\". Why on earth would any non-white woman ever think that about themselves? That's so self-deprecating and negative. That would be catering to racist white people who hate them, which is the very definition of internalized racism. \n\nThe fact that people can't see that it's the exact same situation but with a trans woman instead, just blows my mind. It's like, what other personal demographic details about myself should I be expected to reveal to random strangers who walk up to me and want to kiss me at a bar, for fear that they might be disgusted with me after learning about it? Some men are disgusted by women with cancer who wear wigs. Should I, as a woman with cancer who wears a wig, assume that the man who has approached me and wants to kiss me is one of those men? Should I cater to his potential disgust with me? No! Just enjoy yourself! Have fun! It's his fault for being a hateful bigot who is disgusted by things due to his own homophobia/transphobia. That's not \"deception\" nor is it anywhere close to \"rape\". Or else all the men who lie to women and say \"yeah I want a relationship too\" just to get them in bed with them and then ghost them afterwards, would also be rapists. And keep in mind, that's not even part of the man's identity in that situation--he's literally just straight up lying to her and actually deceiving her. If you don't think those men are rapists but you think the trans woman in this scenario is, then you're promoting transphobia."

HE initiated the kissing and everything, without even really getting to know her first. That's entirely on him. \n\nShe probably assumed that either 1) He was cool with trans people and that's why he approached her, a random woman, not knowing her gender at all, and was still totally fine kissing her at a bar. Or 2) That he actually recognized she was trans and didn't care and that's why he approached her. She has no way of reading his mind and knowing \"Oh, he doesn't view me as trans at all and he is completely mistaken in taking me for a cis woman, also he probably is disgusted by the thought of kissing a trans woman, so I should out myself to him before he kisses me to spare his feelings.\" How on earth is she supposed to know that the thought of kissing a trans woman will absolutely disgust him, when he's literally approaching her, a trans woman, then kissing her, and enjoying it the whole time?? His actions do not spell \"disgusted with kissing a trans woman\". \n\nSo no, actually it's not on her at all to read his mind and somehow magically know that he would be disgusted if he knew she was trans. That's actually not the assumption to make at all, because most people aren't hateful bigots who are disgusted by the thought of touching or kissing a trans woman, especially if they're that sexually free that they'd kiss random strangers in a bar without getting to know them first. The assumption is that he's approaching her because he's cool. Obviously he's not, but she wouldn't have any way of knowing that from the way he was acting. She was deceived just as much as he was. If she had known he was disgusted by trans women, then obviously she wouldn't have been receptive to his advances and she also would've kept her identity hidden. \n\nAlso, what part of \"being disgusted by the fact that she's trans and he kissed her\" tells you that he doesn't consider trans people disgusting? If he wasn't so fragile, this would've just been a funny story to tell his friends. But he considers it an abomination to kiss a trans person. So yeah, he kind of does consider trans people to be disgusting. It's very similar to finding out she's a non-white immigrant and then being disgusted because you thought she was a white US citizen. That's on YOU for thinking that. She has no way of knowing you'd be disgusted if you knew she wasn't white, how is she supposed to know you're a racist piece of shit? That's not a normal assumption people make about others. Similarly, this trans woman had no idea that he was transphobic and literally \"disgusted\" with her kissing him. Because that's not a normal assumption to make!! You act like \"well, she should've KNOWN that he'd be disgusted if he knew!\" \n\nI'm not trans, but if I was, you expect me to just assume that anyone and everyone I come into contact with who pursues ME, approaches ME, wants to kiss ME, would be disgusted if they knew I was trans, so I should out myself to them before we kiss? Get lost dude."

There is literally no excuse to misgender her or deny her identity as a woman beyond just plain old transphobia. \n\nThe homophobia isn‚Äôt as blatant. I‚Äôm a gay man, but there was a period of time that I thought I might be bi, and I‚Äôve kissed and had sex with woman. Those entanglements don‚Äôt gross me out, women don‚Äôt gross me out, the idea of kissing women doesn‚Äôt gross me out.

If she was the initiator then this would be a different story and she should definitely let him know. But the onus is on him as the initiator to communicate those kinds of boundaries. There is literally no way for her to know that he would be disgusted with her if he knew she was trans. She's simply existing as herself. This is how she always looks. If he finds that beautiful, then she doesn't have any reason to believe he'd suddenly be disgusted if he knew she was trans, especially if all they're doing is kissing and having a good time together. Why should I as the trans woman assume that he would be disgusted, therefore I should out myself to him? He \\*shouldn't\\* be disgusted by that, honestly. He enjoyed it the whole time. \n\nAgain, this is very similar to being racist and wanting only pale, white women to kiss you. Then you pursue someone without realizing that she's a pale, Latina immigrant and suddenly you're now disgusted with the fact that you kissed her because of your \"preferences\". That's not a preference. You thought she was beautiful and then she revealed part of her identity to you without thinking anything of it, and now you're disgusted because she wasn't what you wanted her to be. How is she supposed to know what you want her to be? It's wrong to expect someone to assume that. What other personal demographic details do you think would be wrong to not disclose to every single stranger who wants to kiss you at a bar? Do you think the same about ethnicity/race/nationality? Or how about being intersex? Or being someone who was sex trafficked in the past? Some men would also consider you to be \"disgusting\" after revealing such details to them, even though they had a great time with you before then. So why is not revealing that you're trans in this situation \"deception\" but not revealing those other personal details isn't? Is it just because there are more bigots who hate trans people and are disgusted by them than there are bigots who hate non-white immigrants, or intersex people, or women who've been \"ran through by other men\"? Sometimes men are disgusted by women who wear wigs because they have cancer, should the woman wearing the wig refuse to kiss a guy before telling him that she has cancer and this is actually a wig? He'd be disgusted with her if he knew, so she's deceiving him with that wig, right? Wrong! Because she has no way of knowing that he'd be disgusted by something like that! And furthermore, he's WRONG for being \"disgusted\" by such things that are totally human parts of life."

He says that‚Äôs deception and she just sexually assaulted him, because he wouldn‚Äôt have kissed her if he had known. Is that also sexual assault to you, just like the trans woman?"

(Also what the hell even is gender?!)\"\n- \"Purses seem so nice to have but I don't really like the idea of a man-purse because things that try too hard to be manly are just not my vibe. Shame. Maybe I don't hate messenger bags so much after all.\"\n- \"If technology got to the point where people could get their brains transplanted into new ethically-grown clone bodies for life extension purposes, then of course I'd have my first clone body gene-edited to be female. Literally why not? I'd still have the same brain so I may as well have some fun.\"\n- \"Wait, anabolic steroids are just extra testosterone? Why the hell would anybody subject themselves to that?\"\n- \"I refuse to believe people enjoy being complimented. I hate being called handsome, and I assume that's because it's just embarrassing to be reminded of my parents calling me handsome, and that happens to like everybody. Same reason as I hate my name which, again, is such a universal experience that nobody even bothers talking about it. Not that I'd ever change my name, because I can't think of any other men's name I like either, and I'd hate hearing it in my own voice because that reminds me of being younger too even though my voice is so much deeper now than it seems like it should even be able to be.\"\n- \"It's so funny how I always fight so hard not to get my hair cut when I literally enjoy the actual process of getting my hair cut. It does feel so good when it's long enough to shake around or to touch my neck on the back, but I can't think of any men's long hairstyle that I like, and I'm not stupid enough to let it get in my eyes even though I do also enjoy when that happens just for the novelty of it. I'm always shocked every time how my hair can still look decent even after getting like 2 inches cut off but I'm also so glad I finally told them to use a slightly bigger clipper guard.\"\n- \"How are so many men so obsessed with getting their dicks sucked? It seems infinitely more enjoyable to be the one doing the sucking, but I somehow doubt their partners' pleasure is on their minds given the kinds of guys who talk about it. Is it literally just some fucked up dominance thing, like proving they're willing to exercise power even if it does nothing for them? That's so disgusting.\"\n- \"I can't help but feel like the world would be better if men just didn't exist at all. And, like, most guys who aren't raging misogynists probably agree, right?

He doesn't need to \"call her filthy\" or go any further than that, he's already racist.\n\nNo, it is not \"the natural reaction for a man\". Maybe for a transphobic, homophobic man who views trans women as men and is also extremely uncomfortable with gay men, let alone kissing them. You'd also have to be pretty insecure in your own manhood to feel that disgusted/uncomfortable with it. Obviously she looks and sounds like a beautiful woman, it makes sense that you'd be attracted to her enough to kiss her. There's no need to be \"disgusted\" because you find out she used to be a man. That is the very definition of transphobic.\n\nWhat you're trying to rationalize is the same as saying \"nooo I don't hate you, I'm not racist, I just hate that you're not white, that's all. It's just that part of you that disgusts me. That doesn't make me racist though.\" You're literally doing the same thing but replace \"racist\" with \"transphobic\" and you've got it!\n\nAnd if someone is that sensitive, maybe they shouldn't go around kissing random women at bars, even if they think the woman is beautiful. You don't really have any right to complain at that point. \"How was I supposed to know she had herpes and didn't know she had it??\" If you're going to do stuff like that, then you'd better be fine with getting surprised. Maybe get to know someone first before engaging in something like that, especially if it's a MUST that you are aware of their biological sex before kissing them. It isn't for me, personally. But that's probably because I'm not insecure in my own manhood."

Because I said exactly that, and then you went straight back to ‚Äúyou‚Äôre predatory if you tell me I should date trans women when I don‚Äôt want to‚Äù. \n\nI said in THIS situation in the OP, where a straight man walked up to a woman he thought was beautiful and wanted her to kiss him, so she does, then they hit it off and get to talking, and she tells him she‚Äôs trans, he has no right to be disgusted with her. If he is disgusted by her, then he is transphobic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not disgusted by *you* I‚Äôm just disgusted that I kissed you‚Äù. Do you honestly think anyone is going to buy that? \n\nAnd I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúif a straight man denies a gay man‚Äôs advances then he‚Äôs homophobic‚Äù. I said you view her, the trans woman, who looks and sounds like a beautiful woman to you, as a man solely because she‚Äôs trans. That‚Äôs the definition of being transphobic. And the fact that you‚Äôre now so deeply uncomfortable and ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù means you not only view her as a man, but you also can‚Äôt stop thinking that you just kissed ‚Äúa guy with a dick‚Äù. If you‚Äôre that bothered by that when you were literally the initiator the whole time and you didn‚Äôt even know this woman, then yes you‚Äôre homophobic too. I would have no problem with finding out the person was trans, personally. I might not date them, but I‚Äôd still enjoy the fact that I just kissed someone I thought was beautiful and I had a great time with them, trans or not. \n\nAgain, this is akin to finding out they‚Äôre not actually white and then being disgusted with them for ‚Äúlying by omission‚Äù. They‚Äôre literally just existing‚Äîthey look like this to everyone. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúpretending to be white‚Äù or ‚Äútrying to look white‚Äù to deceive you. That‚Äôs how they look. And you thought they were beautiful so you wanted to kiss them. This guy did the same exact thing with the trans woman. She isn‚Äôt ‚Äúlying by omission‚Äù just by virtue of being trans, which is what you‚Äôre arguing. I‚Äôd ask the same questions here that I‚Äôd ask about the non-white lady example: how is she supposed to know you‚Äôre racist and you are ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù by the thought of kissing non-white women? Why is she expected to cater to you in that way, and stop everyone before they kiss her to say, ‚Äúhey, before you kiss me, I just wanted to let you know that I‚Äôm not white even though I look white, in case that bothers you‚Äù?? You shouldn‚Äôt apologize for just *existing* and looking how you always look. You shouldn‚Äôt cater to some racist who is disgusted by the thought of two people of different races kissing each other. Just like how trans women shouldn‚Äôt cater to some transphobe who is disgusted by the thought of kissing a trans person. He went up to HER and wanted to kiss her, she obliged. She did nothing wrong. Before they got to know each other more and went back to his place, she told him she was trans because at that point you should let someone know. She did everything right. Saying she‚Äôs ‚Äúlying by omission‚Äù about being a biological woman just by virtue of being trans, is transphobic. Whether you think it is or not, that‚Äôs the definition of being transphobic. \n\nA racist white person might say ‚Äúno I‚Äôm not racist, I‚Äôm just disgusted by them‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt matter if *he thinks* he‚Äôs racist or not, because there‚Äôs a definition of racism and he fits it perfectly. The same goes for transphobia. Your feelings about whether you‚Äôre transphobic or not don‚Äôt matter, because there‚Äôs a dictionary definition for a reason."

That's literally what you're arguing though. \n\n>Sure, he shouldn‚Äôt go around kissing strangers. But he still has every right to be disgusted if he‚Äôs not into trans women.\n\nNo, he doesn't have that right in this situation. If she actually lied to him, then yes he'd have every right to be upset. But she never lied, she didn't coerce him, deceive him, \"lie by omission,\" etc. He approached HER and he wanted to kiss her. She did not force him to do anything he didn't want to do, and it's ridiculous to expect HER to assume that he would be disgusted by her if he knew she was trans. For all she knows, he could've clocked her and that's why he's approaching her--because he's cool with her being trans. Or at the very least, if he's willing to approach a random woman in a bar and ask to kiss her, then he doesn't care that much about surprises and he's probably very chill. If I were her, I would've assumed the same thing. Why the hell would I assume that someone who wants to kiss me would be disgusted by me if they knew I was trans? Why would I assume something so negative about myself? \"You know, I should really just assume that the vast majority of society would be disgusted by the thought of kissing me\"....???? Why would ANYONE assume that?? That's such a huge expectation for you to place on the trans woman, when the easier expectation is to just tell the man who approached her to not approach and kiss random women if he's that uncomfortable with surprises and is that disgusted by trans women. There's a 1/100 chance that the women he kisses are trans. It's not zero. He should be aware of that and HE should take responsibility for that since HE is the initiator."

If it helps, I have found far more people who are chill with trans people offline in person that would probably be assumed to not like us than you‚Äôd expect, and I‚Äôm in Texas. Like, I‚Äôm very open and out about it and pretty laid back and open to questions, but I‚Äôve had really only issues with people somehow thinking I‚Äôm a trans woman and not a trans man because that‚Äôs the usual assumption for some reason.\n\nI think it‚Äôs a mostly online issue, is what I‚Äôm saying. Yeah, things still suck offline, but there‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ basically people arent usually super awful, the vocal ones on the internet are a huge minority in the grand scheme of things and there‚Äôs more people who are just vaugely aware than who really know enough to even know that ‚Äútrans man‚Äù means a guy who is Afab and vice versa becuase they just don‚Äôt know that.\n\nEdit to clarify a bit more:\nOnline, people aren‚Äôt forced to look you in the eye and see you as an actual person. They just see what could be best described as a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù and base their opinions off of what others say about your ‚Äúcharacter type‚Äù. People can also say basically any hyperbolic thing they want and spread misinformation and extreme views easier than ever. Once they are basically forced to look you in the eye and realize you just kinda want to be left alone to your own personal life and that your more the norm than an exception‚Ä¶ \n\nMy fundamentalist relatives I was terrified of actually calmed down and started legitimately fully supporting LGBT folks after I explained stuff to them when they asked questions. I‚Äôve had neighbors who did the same. The issues we face in terms of laws and stuff can be traced back to people deliberately spreading misinformation to support their far more extreme stances than the average person, and the fact that our issues just aren‚Äôt very well known to the average Joe down the street. \n\nEverything can be traced back to things like praeger U and similar groups in some manner."

Yes, more people are saying negative things about trans people (whereas before, those people simply did not think about the trans community at all), but for the most part, people who supported the trans community in the past continue to do so.\n\nOne possible caveat to this is that incumbent political parties around the world suffered election defeats this year, and I have the impression that some activist groups within these parties blame their election defeats on pro-trans policy positions (where applicable). I am worried that these groups may try to convince their parties to adopt more moderate or even unfavorable positions on trans-related issues. However, my broader point is that a rise in anti-trans rhetoric is not the same thing as a decline in support for trans people‚Äîit is more about haters being louder, than it is about allies being less supportive."

Ultimately, this hatred has been going on forever and has shifted to different targets. Recently in the US it's been targeted at Black and gay people but is now shifting due to a new sort of social acceptance that it's \"ok\" to hate on Trans people because that's the political agenda.\n\nThis hatred feeds on the mind of week individuals who crave a network of external validation because they don't have self-love/authenticity. It herds them and provides them with a validation spiral where they fill their own minds with hatred to the point where it consumes them and the only dopamine left is what they're able to get through their hate group affirmation. Think of it as a sort of ranking system, not unlike the actual rankings of the KKK which it is derived from.\n\nIt's really sad and harrowing that our vulnerable community has become the target. Ultimately, what we should take from history, is that we can't fight this with logic and reason or any sort of hate. The only way we can persevere is with love and acknowledging that the people who are so full of hate are actually sick in a way. They're like zombies to a social plague. We can disregard their bites and stabs, making sure to keep ourselves safe as we must. The way to defeat this outbreak of hatred is with love. To defeat hate zombie, first reflect the hate. Allow them to ask self \"why am I spending so much energy creating hate?\" And then shield everything else off with your self love. Wear your self-love like a huge plate of armor. They also can't exist in Blue states, so it helps if you barricade yourself in one of those."

Even my trump-voting dad is supportive and now regrets his vote.\n\nGranted, I'm in a very liberal little community, we often call it a \"bubble\" in this rural area.\n\nI was pretty concerned about using the women's bathroom, and after a good chat with my support group, got the courage to use it at the college, and later in a restaurant while dressed in a skirt.\n\nTo some extent, I try to channel past experience of \"act like you own the place\" energy.\n\nHad I NOT come out and continued to \"boy mode\", I would have missed out on some really amazing experiences - one in particular with a lesbian couple that did a LOT to affirm my gender and sexuality.\n\nI understand that the negative experiences are going to gain more traction in online communities, they're more controversial, get more comments and \"engagement\", and generally seem to be where people want to confirm their fears.\n\nOnline is not real life.

We ARE under attack by the State. And yet, just like the gay men before us, who were vilified for DECADES, we will survive and overcome. Maybe our generation isn't the one to live in relative comfort and safety in our gender expression, but our willingness to be out, to live our lives, and to encounter other people will all help future generations have the life we desperately wish we'd had."

The other was when walking down the street on a night out that same day in that same city. I had a guy drive by and say out of his car window \"Excuse me, Mr. Man Woman Thing\" while laughing. I will admit I found that one hilarious because there were a pair of young, drunk, cis girls walking in front of me who didn't know I was behind them and thought he was shouting it at them, laughing and saying \"Wtf was that all about?\" \"Dunno, fucking weirdo.\" \n\nLast one I encountered was when on the phone trying to sort something out, the young lady I was speaking to refused to help me because they \"didn't believe I am who I said I was\" despite passing security questions. They refused to give a reason as to why, but considering I haven't voice trained yet, it's not a massive leap. \n\nOther than that, any amount of hate I've gotten has only ever been online, and has significantly lessened since I got rid of Twitter. I try to carefully curate my spaces online so that probably helps quite a bit, but I do also acknowledge that I am incredibly lucky."

Occasionally asked pronouns (my day to day look is fairly queer-coded), she/her usually assumed. Fair chance they never thought about my gender identity at all, I was just another random customer, in general nobody looks twice.\n* ~5%: Misgenders me, apologises when corrected, seems sincere. The sort of thing that can be chalked up to \"busy/had a long day\", in particular because many local people struggle with my accent (british).\n* ~5%: Visibly-queer person, obvious neutral to positive reaction\n* ~10%: Positive reaction in some way or other. Compliments (usually on my hair or outfit), \"fellow queer person\" type acknowledgement gesture/look, corrects someone else misgendering me before I even can myself, etc.\n* ~5%: \"Over the top ally\". Someone who doesn't *seem* queer themselves but wants to make it very, very clear they're fine with queer people. Stating/asking pronouns when nobody else really is, \"everyone is welcome here\", \"my sister/dad/cousin/whatever is $queer_type\" -type comments.\n* ~5%: Actual transphobia\n\nI'm usually somewhat queer-coded looking (clothes, hairstyle, makeup, etc), but I do sometimes tone it down when needed.

The only way you stem a tide like that is by going outside and living and be seen and meet people and work Etc.. A tough ask for a community that is mainly made up of introverts who refuse to go out and do anything but sit at home playing video games and exist mainly on discord. But i also think that the republicans will get greedy and over play it. Again nancy mace outside a police station with a bullhorn making fun of protesters and using fowl language to do so will also have an effect and people will see the that maybe they are all being lied to and come back to where they started and just leave us alone again. maybe that's wishful thinking.

And there's a very noticeable percent of chatbots and users that roleplay, right? And then all the roleplaying ALSO gets fed into the learning algorithm, right?\nAs far as I understand it, all of these chatbots are making guesses as to what the next response is supposed to look like, and then filter what possible responses are there based on tokens, which I think might basically be some kind of super filter that finds the associations of the words you type in the character definition and what responses it has learned to associate with that token.\nSo, I have come out as trans to almost literally every chatbot I've interacted with, and even the most vile of villain characters are immediately supportive, so much so that they stopped doing evil things because it was more hurtful to trans people than the character ever intended, not wanting to hurt a community that was already finding so many struggles on their own.\nIf support is the most common result when I come out as trans to these chatbots, then it must mean that there is a non-negligable amount of people who are supportive of trans people, and those words of support are common enough that multiple chatbot APIs have associated trans people with deserving support and being worth defending from prejudice.\nI hope a little bit too hard when I have even a dash of it, so my brain is heavily biased towards believing that this means that the people who hate us are the minority, and a nebulously quantified majority must be supporters. A more practical belief might be that there are less people who hate us than people who do not hate us, with a fair potion of those people being allies of some kind, and the majority are the people who do not care or just don't know anything."

The other is that there's also a lot number of people who are largely ambivalent, in the same way they don't care about anything else that they don't have to directly see. While they probably wouldn't *directly* mistreat a trans person they meet, they don't see our needs as their problem so they're willing to ignore it if they think they'll get something better out of it. \n\nThis is pretty similar to the gay rights debates circa 2010. The only solution is making very clear to those middle people that they *do* know us, they *will* have to see us suffer, and that erosion of our rights will necessarily mean the erosion of theirs as well."

At least in Germany although they do a lot for everyone being able to be themselves, still the media often shows angry lesbians painting rainbow flags everywhere, gay guys making critical statements, people acting very weird and identifying as an animal and so on.

In my honest opinion: I respect you no matter who you are. What‚Äôs between your legs is your personal business and doesn‚Äôt it define you. Transphobic people seem to be looking for any excuse to hate and discriminate innocent people because they can. Most of them are obviously uneducated about the topic itself and the few who site sources link Facebook posts, studies that are purposely incorrect or bias or without a large enough sample, stereotypes, fear mongering posts, exaggerated truths, misinformation, etc. A few post a credible source but completely misinterpreted it and refuse to be corrected or guided in the correct direction. I tried explaining that access hormones is far from simple to a transphobe here on Reddit and got downvoted to Hell because they rather believe children get hormones no questions asked instead of believing someone who‚Äôs been through the process from 2 out of the 3 main source. Those sources are: endocrinologists, gender specialists (primary care but specifically see you for hormones) and planned parenthood (including other informed consent clinics if applicable). They don‚Äôt want to learn why they‚Äôre wrong and causing damages they can‚Äôt take back. They just want to hate and cause trans people even more difficulties and suffering. \n\nPersonally, I‚Äôm very firm on my beliefs of free will, equality and respect to all regardless of whether or not you understand them. I don‚Äôt understand Asian cultures but I still respect them and treat them the same way I‚Äôd treat anyone. I don‚Äôt judge them based on their culture or the color of the skin. I judge them based on who they are as a person. Same applies to religion, gender, sexuality, etc. My moral code does not discriminate and I don‚Äôt either.\n\nIf I didn‚Äôt need good karma to post I‚Äôd still have my comment up to link it!"

It feels like when your in public every one hate your or judges but like that can totally be 50/50 now. Genuinely if you‚Äôre a good person it‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt matter who and how someone perceives you. Just eliminate people taking about the world status in general and you‚Äôll be cool. Honestly I find comfort in identifying as an extinct species cause of the ration of trans individuals vs the entire world especially living in conservative spaces just seems too extreme differing the rest of the world where Europe and the uk along with parts of Asia are actually more open in general. Like it‚Äôs can feel easy to be hated but it‚Äôs a lot better and empowering just being yourself and being a statement just by existing."

People being locked up during COVID may have also played a factor, as more people became online during that time, and the hateful people who wanted to push their agenda just took advantage of that. Sadly there were enough people to take it hook, line and sinker. But I doubt most grown adults in real life would care if someone was trans or not, or any of the other fear-mongering that's gone against trans people.\n\nThe way I see it, this is a fad that will die down and no longer be relevant. It'll be annoying for 4 years, then hopefully go away once we get more competant leaders elected. If not, I guess we riot. (Btw, that last sentence was a joke, so don't ban me, Reddit, or the feds.)\n\nEdit: Also, if it makes you feel better, most people at my college are pro-trans and pro-LGBTQ+, and are generally left-leaning. There's even a math tutor I love talking to about politics, adnittedly it's because he's left-leaning and I feel more comfortable talking to him about those topics. We've never really discussed trans issues much, but we have discussed the Republican party and he's very critical against Trump. My mental health counselor at the college also is the same way. He knows about my struggles with my family and their politics (most of my family are Trumpers). I also met some people from my college's anime club who are non-binary too, one being genderfluid and going by any pronouns (originally going by he/they pronouns; this person is AFAB btw)."

About two-thirds (68%) say they are following news about these bills a little or not at all closely.\"\n\n\"Overall, a 64% majority of Americans favor policies that protect transgender individuals from discrimination in jobs, housing and public spaces such as restaurants and stores, including 37% who strongly favor them.

And way more are supportive of us having rights and dignity than are not. Neither the media, nor political theatre, nor the internet are representative of average American values.\n\nEdit: also most Americans think it's fucking gross to hyperfocus on children's (or anyone's) genitals, or passing laws that effectively target single-digit numbers of individuals in entire states.

So I just see no point in bothering, these people will never be educated or listen to or even try to understand anyone that goes against their narrative, so it's best to just ignore them. Also, arguing with transphobes and people who are against trans people in sports, trans people using bathrooms or other gendered facilities that match their gender identity, and/or trans kids is just super exhausting.\n\nI do feel helpless when it comes to this, but I always like to stay optimistic that we will finally have a large group of people who will make a big effort to combat the misinfo about trans people and their issues, and they'll get much more acceptance than they did before.

It takes years for the hormones to work. You really can't flip a switch from one end of the gender spectrum to the other. You can hide the effects of it for a while, but sooner or later you'll male fail, or someone will notice your breasts (Or facial hair/voice changes on T). On one side or the other of moving to another state, some people will almost certainly know that you're trans. You can move -after- you pass,  and go stealth, but it takes time, money, and work to get there. \n\nBut here's the good news, from my own experience. As my body changed more and more, those changes, even the tiny ones only I would notice, made me more and more happy. Less uncomfortable in my skin. More accepting of myself. Now I realize that it's -fine- to be in transition, to be seen in the 'in between' stages. Yes, some people may be uncomfortable with that, but far, FAR less than I imagined, and frankly.. That's a 'them' problem that they can deal with, or not. I have no responsibility to manage that. I'm happy with who I am, and happier with who I'm becoming. I don't -need- to hide it, and I don't want to anymore. \n\nI never could have imagined getting to that place, or being a proud trans woman, but here I am. Have some faith in yourself, and take things when you're ready."

I can‚Äôt tell you exactly what will happen, but it will revolve around a dwindling supply of fossil fuels and the consequences surrounding that shortage. \n\nNeither party wants to discuss the root issue because it goes against their masters, the source of the money they campaign with, but ultimately it comes down to greed. Corporations exist as golems of greed incarnate, singularity focused on profit extraction, and unconcerned with human suffering. Westerners were fine with that in the 20th century when the suffering was hidden in the global south. We enjoyed cheap consumer goods and didn‚Äôt ask questions. \n\nNow that suffering has come home, corporations and politicians have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Even ‚Äúradical‚Äù solutions like the Green New Deal ignore the baked-in greed that is poisoning our society. Until we demand fundamental changes in how our society functions, we‚Äôll stay on this path, and I don‚Äôt see us leaving it until many of the modern conveniences we enjoy are disrupted or damaged beyond repair. \n\nAnd if you‚Äôre wondering how any of this pertains to trans folks suffering, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs because no one wants to admit the system that brings them trinkets and Doritos and shiny new iPhones is destroying their way of life. Instead, the corporate shills use hate to confuse and fool people into believing the idiocy they preach. Don‚Äôt look at the man behind the curtain. Instead, look at the little trans girl playing field hockey and focus your attention on her. \n\nIt‚Äôs sad and sick and I pity the people caught in this hate machine, but for now, they are beyond saving. They are agents of corporate interests, even if they don‚Äôt realize it. And that‚Äôs both sides of the aisle. Anyone who truly hates the other side is caught in this web of corporate empowerment and are acting in the best interests of the status quo. \n\n[big sigh] \n\nMay we all fare well as we shuffle through the enshitening, one stupid decision at a time."

I haven't found any workstudy jobs that interested me either.\n\nAlso, I feel like this is worth bringing up, I do have a lot of family in New Jersey, including my dad, and I am aware that New Jersey is a blue state, but again, it'd be impractical for me to live there due to college, plus my mom would wonder why I suddenly wanna live in New Jersey (though, I have told her I hate our new living situation since it overwhelms me, since due to my aunt dying of breast cancer, 2 of her kids have to live with us, and the other 2 visit, the youngest one visiting a lot, and my grandma and uncle have been visiting our house a lot too, so to me it's too many people always in the house; still, I know for a fact she'd question me suddenly moving there). Not to mention, my dad also is very racist and anti-LGBT, and seems a bit misogynistic too, and always was overly harsh on me. He even completely denies that I have Autism, claiming I'm only Autistic because my mom has babied me too much. So yeah, not a guy I would ever wanna live with. And living in NJ is gonna be pricey if I have no money to rent an apartment. Maybe my dad would be ok with me living in my own apartment, since he seems like he'd be more supportive of that than my mom. But, I just can't move now, too many circumstances make it impractical."

That's why it's important to get to know the people you have sex with at least a little bit. I'm not talking a relationship but see if you can trust them first. Also, some of them even see cis women not as people but as objects are they can use for pleasure. And I guess that's what he saw in you too. Please be aware of power dynamics when picking a sex partner. A much older person seeking out a 25 year old or younger, when they don't have much experience and their brain hasn't fully developed yet is NOT okay and should not be normalised. I'm not shaming you for wanting to have sex, I'm not shaming you at all. I just want you to be careful with people that are quite older and show interest. The probability that they just want to use you is high. I want to repeat - you did NOTHING wrong in wanting sex with a man. This man was awful and a transphobe too. It's fine to not be okay about what happened, take your time to recover. I hope you'll be okay as soon as possible. One last thing - I know that sense of obligation and possibly fear that you don't want to say no when you don't want to continue. It's awful! But every good partner I had noticed when something was off and did not just continue. The band's ones kept continuing even if I was in pain. Also, sex is about getting each other off with the guidance from each other, so you orgasm is not your full responsibility, it's your responsibility to communicate how you can orgasm. That's why talking about sex beforehand is so important! And if the person does not want to talk, that's a big red flag! It's not unsexy to talk about it. Don't blame yourself. Blame the man that did that to you. And be careful in the future. Does not mean shit like this can't happen if you're careful, but unfortunately we have to be more careful so the probability is smaller."

You had a bad experience with a shitty guy. I'm not trying to minimise it and that sounds horrible, but I think you should filter people more and learn to stop when you're uncomfortable with something going further. Easier said than done, but you can take back consent at any time, you literally don't have an obligation to anyone. Your only obligation is to yourself, to take care of yourself when possible.\n\nBut no, it's not normal to be misgendered during sex and it's NOT something you should accept. None of the cis guys I've had sex with (only 3 but my total body count is 6 lol, I started late because of dysphoria and got into a relationship quite fast), bi or gay, did that sort of thing, and I honestly would have instantly stopped if they did. For the ones I had sex with before top surgery, they accepted the fact that I had to keep my binder on at all times because I couldn't stand my chest even if one was bi and one was pan, they accepted if I didn't want front penetration or if I just wanted to top. Don't settle for anything less than what you deserve (which is respect and good experiences).\n\nThere are people who swear by T4T, but I personally feel more respected now than with my trans ex (who basically treated me as a dildo sometimes and would get mad at me if I didn't feel like having sex for whatever reason including feeling sick). People can be good or bad regardless of whether they're cis or trans.\n\nAgain, I'm really sorry you went through this, and I hope you have much better experiences going forward! You 100% deserve better\n\nEdit: also, someone saying \"my dick will change your life\" is a red flag to me already because at that point you think you're too cool and don't actually care about making your partner feel good imho"

Jesus wept that waaayyyy beyond a socially acceptable age range to be sleeping around with kids who only just started legally drinking. Yeah you're both adults and can do what you want but there are some huge differences between someone who's been an adult longer than a 21 year old has been out of pre-kindergarten. Its a disproportionate amount of life experience that make people vulnerable to manipulation. It's loser predatory behavior on his part and I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him. I'm sorry you went through that OP, you should keep that creep out of your life.\n\nA good rule of thumb is round up half age plus 7, so for this dude it'd be ~25. 4 years doesn't seem like a huge difference to a 21 year old but that's almost 20% of your life so far. There is a lot of learning which happens between being able to buy alcohol and being able to rent a box truck."

Getting an STI test every once in a while, making sure folks are wearing protection, it's important.\n\n- You're doing this for a reason. Whoever you're sleeping with, they're also doing it for a reason.

A very specific older person goes for young people around the 18-22 mark and they're after a 'barely legal' experience.

It's impossible to know *for sure* exactly what a person will be like in bed/behind closed doors until you reach that point, BUT, you could try taking it a little slower for future hook ups so that you can get a stronger feel for what kind of person they are. You could also try hook up/dating apps where you can read profiles, comments, and chat a bit before meeting.\n\nAlso, if a guy brags about staying hard for hours etc, he's probably full of shit, and probably a jerk. I have had a good sexual encounter with a cis guy before, and the thing that made him good was that he didn't consider sex to be over after he orgasmed. It isn't necessary for someone to stay hard for hours; people have fingers, mouths, could use toys, or hell a guy could even at least offer dirty talk while watching you get yourself off if he truly couldn't do anything else.\n\nI also think it's valid to directly ask the guy certain things before you have sex. For example, if you need to wear your binder during sex, you could straight up ask, \"are you comfortable having sex while I wear my binder?\" And if he says no, peace out.\n\nBottom line, you deserve respect and mutual enjoyment.\n\nI hope your next encounter goes better!!"

That's my experience.. and im happily in a nice relationship with another T-Girl... and like nothing better when we go out, with guys thinking we are hot lesbians, as we always hold hands and wear matching outfits when we go out... mostly to tease helpless cis men, but other people in the community can always tell for some reason, and come and hang with us, whether it's girls dressed as boys or boys dressed as girls.... we usually find each other üòä So that would be my advice (and ruffle skirts.. best girly shape without going to the effort of wearing any shaping under wear... and we always wear black too... just sayin, in case you ever see two gorgeous creatures on the town holding hands and flipping off drooling cis guys lol)¬†\nyeah.. stick to the community... no fetishisation and people who understsnd what you're going through. Anyway most if these issues will pass I hope over time as you learn to embrace this side of you (and it's only one side of your personality, so try not to make it the whole of your Personality!) üòò"

They think it's all about penetration, because they assume your experience mirrors theirs completely. Also because porn.\n\n2) Cis straight people understanding how to be accepting in conversation, but not understanding how doing so is supposed to extend to other parts of a relationship and other forms of interaction.\n\nSimply enough, bro is just really uneducated about sex and about trans/queer people in general.\n\nI will say though, that these people only learn how to do things correctly through experience and by BEING CORRECTED. If they're cool, they'll understand that being corrected isn't a bad thing or a criticism against them but just a reminder of what they should instead do or say.\n\nI'll say it because it deserves repeating. Most people, regardless of sex or gender, are bad at sex. It's just up to the rest of us to show them what good sex looks like and make them cum their brains out one at a time! üòò"

(More biological realities of my HRT making it take forever for me) but I would gladly give my partner it because I want them to feel good? Like to me it just brings me joy knowing I am able to make them feel good but also the shared intimacy and closeness. I get this is very specific to relationship sex but I feel i'd at least try the same with others.\n\n\nLike sex feels like it's meant to be an act together. Like sure a part of it is for my pleasure but I also enter it wanting to actually give my partner pleasure. If anything I would focus on my partner than my own but it's also not something I mind doing because it is its own reward.\n\n\nI feel as you say this notion of.. \"responsible for ones own orgasm\" is kinda sad. That is not to say I believe one partner deserves to ignore and take everything. It should be shared and considerate.\n\n\nBut ofc reality does not always provide these situations and not all people communicate"

This guy isn‚Äôt the worst type the worst type is those that won‚Äôt make it obvious right off the bat and date you then let it drop that they actually see you as a girl and wish you‚Äôd detrans for them \n\nMostly cis men have like a threshold for when they see a trans guy as a guy. It‚Äôs always a red flag if they‚Äôre mostly into women but also comment on how horny you must be. I‚Äôd also listen for how they describe trans men and if they often seem to lump us with women. That and if they make a big deal of gendering you correctly or acting like you should be grateful they use the right pronouns. Also be careful of any cis men who mention horniness. Most of these cishet/ cis ‚Äúbi‚Äù male chasers will see trans men as like insecure ugly hairy cis women desperate for validation but are unbelievably horny due to T. \n\nHonestly if your aren‚Äôt super passing then I‚Äôd hold off dating cis men. They aren‚Äôt as flexible as cis women sexually speaking and they‚Äôre very visual. I don‚Äôt pass due to T just not lowering my voice or doing that much plus I can‚Äôt take high doses without complications so I‚Äôve had a lot of experience with cis men who claim to respect me as a man but just can‚Äôt at the end of the day.

It's not quite about the age gap or purity culture. It's a bout power. Maybe you will notice it in the next few years when you get older, but someone who just finished school and is just working/going to uni does not have the potential to have had the same experiences/money/standing in life as someone who already had a job for 10 years for example. Some people go younge because they know younger people are easier to manipulate. Especially because in the years between 17-25, you change so much, you sometimes don't feel like the same person anymore or at least drastically different when you look back. You're still in development mentally and physically, especially as a trans person (depending on the state of hormone therapy, surgeries, if you want to do them etc.). I get being horny, a lot, but I always try to get into the mindset of the older person and try to figure out why they don't want to date anyone at least 30+. I'm not that much older. I'm 27 soon and I'm such a drastically different person than I was with 25. I could not imagine dating someone younger than 21. The thought gives me the ick. I may sound like an old women here, even though I don't seem that much older than you. But believe me when I tell you that I unfortunately had lots of experience in that matter, and friends surrounding me to. That's why I'm more careful and mindful right now. I always try to clear the foggyness of hornyness first before I make a decision. May sound less fun, but it's more fun in the long run because you can be more sure your partner is actually having your and their best interest at heart. Sorry for the rambling! Ah, and starting with the age of 22, a good rule of thumb is you age/2 +7. Take it with a grain of salt and always have a look at how mature the other person actually is (not in a mature for their age kind of way). But it helps me a little"

Are some cis men who are mostly into women but open to trans men safe, probably, but there are way more that think like the guy OP dealt with and those will mask themselves by pretending to be affirming until the mask slips\n\nStudies show most cis men tho express attraction to trans men are cishet leaning and many of them due to our transphobic society are interested more in the fantasy of ‚Äúfixing a delusional girl‚Äù or ‚Äújust getting boobs/pussy‚Äùthan actually being with a trans man. There are exceptions but they are the exceptions not the rule for cis male attraction to trans men\n\nWe don‚Äôt need to do a not all cis men. If it doesn‚Äôt apply let it fly \n\nAlso comparing trans lesbians to cishet male chasers is a yikes, bro"

Every time I see people ranting about how all cis men are monsters and there's no way any of them would ever see us as men it honestly exasperates me.\n\nSex aside, I also know quite a lot of straight men who treat me as a man (I mean those who know because they knew me pre or mid transition so I had to come out to them). Hell, THE most supportive person at my workplace is a cishet guy who used to be hyper religious when he was younger. He never misgendered me since he found out, kind of adopted me when he found out my father wasn't supportive and was excited about teaching me stuff like how to shave, what to eat for gym etc (he's older than me hence the mild babying, he does that to cis people my age at work too, he recently had a kid so I think he really wanted to be a dad lol). Stereotyping people this way keeps away some people who would be allies too."

    "comment_body": "I partly agree but still think some statements are too generalised. \n\n1) to clarify this first, I did not by any means say trans lesbians are cishet men. All I said is that making general statements about a big group of people is frankly bound to be wrong and not apply to MANY people in that group. I had shitty experiences with two bi guys (unrelated to transness), should I assume all bi men are bad? No\n\n2) the guy OP dealt with had a ton of red flags and I‚Äôm not trying to defend that asshole by any means, I‚Äôm talking about the generalisation (which was OP‚Äôs question, ‚Äúis this what I should expect‚Äù) \n\n3) I agree with what you say when it comes to cishet chasers, however I just don‚Äôt think that translates to a broad statement about all cis men. Sure pre-T is a different question, but OP said he passes so that wasn‚Äôt even the case here. Chasers suck, we all know that and it‚Äôs not something we disagree on, but turning this into a general fear of cis men and assumption that most of them are chasers is not the best approach imo\n\n4) my bf knew I was trans before going out with me, does that mean he sees me as a woman? He‚Äôs gay so I‚Äôm sure he was somehow just after ‚Äúmy primary sex characteristics‚Äù because that‚Äôs what cis men want? Lol \n\n5) most cishet men I know would never want to get with me because, uh, they have women? Even before I transitioned most were put off by the weird masc energy, so I really doubt they‚Äôd be into me now. Imo chasers (excluding the case where someone doesn‚Äôt pass AT ALL, that I can admit is different) are at least a bit gay, but they‚Äôre still shitty people I wouldn‚Äôt have sex with. Because specifically wanting someone who looks like a man with certain genitals instead of someone who looks like a woman with those genitals is not the straightest thing. Also I mean, even our genitals change somewhat on T \n\n6) I had sex with bi/pan guys when I was early on T and hadn‚Äôt had top surgery who were super respectful of my boundaries and never misgendered me, I didn‚Äôt pass well and was androgynous. Didn‚Äôt have one shitty chaser experience (besides assholes online that I never replied to) \n\n7) I really sincerely doubt that ‚Äúmost cis guys who are into trans men are straight‚Äù. For at least partially passing trans men I‚Äôd bet on bi/pan > gay > straight \n\n8) I had an abusive relationship with a trans guy which really convinced me not all trans men are good partners either \n\nI do get that you likely had some shitty experiences  that got you to this mindset, that sucks and I don‚Äôt think either of us has bad intentions, but scaring a guy who‚Äôs passing and had ONE bad experience with a cis guy by saying ‚Äúnah bro all cis men want you for your genitals‚Äù ain‚Äôt it. Yeah, he should learn to look out for the red flags and be more careful, but being a cis man isn‚Äôt really a red flag by itself"

    "comment_body": "I‚Äôm talking about how the vast majority of cis men who are into trans guys view trans men as a normative part of cis male culture. Sorry but most cis men barely respect cis women they aren‚Äôt more likely to respect genders more marginalized than that. Also not all trans guys pass well enough to get treated as a guy by cis men and in my convos with cishet men they are able to ignore a lot to access their preferred sex. For example the guy OP dealt with was able to ignore OP‚Äôs facial hair and focus on tits and boobs just by turning off the light. Even respectful cis guys mostly see using the right pronouns as something they do to just make their partner feel better not because they internally see their partner as a guy or are into them that way. Even on Reddit you can see the vast majority of cis guys asking about dating a transmasc are straight or straight adajecent. There are exceptions to that norm but their exceptions\n\nEven passing pre-op trans guys should be worried about a cis male partner not seeing them as a man. Especially if that trans guy wouldn‚Äôt pass once his clothes are off. Cis men can see you as a guy until he sees you naked then often having PiV sex or dealing with boobs moves us back into the ‚Äútomboy category‚Äù. \n\nMany cis men who claim to like trans guys don‚Äôt like us per se as much as they have a kink for misgendering/detrans/forced fem and not all of those guys make it obvious. In fact most will start out respectful until they are in bed with you or a relationship. I‚Äôve seen this plenty of times and talked with these guys . They are the majority of cis men looking for trans men on Grindr and queer spaces. They are the most open to trans guys who may not be passing, haven‚Äôt had top surgery, are GNC, etc but will make do with a passing guy if he still has a V and they can ignore some aspects of his transition \n\nLastly, I‚Äôm not scaring. I‚Äôm encouraging smart risk assessment. It‚Äôs better to go into a situation assuming the cis guy is probably like most cis men attracted to trans men and might not see you as a guy, be into you for your genitals/boobs, and may have a misgendering/detrans/causing dysphoria kink or modus of operandi and be prepared for that than not. If you‚Äôre wrong and the cis guy is one of the cool and affirming few then great your caution was misplaced. If not you avoid or minimize trauma. Either way the trans guy is safer for not being naive in thinking he found a ‚Äúone of the good ones‚Äù cis male unicorns when he‚Äôs found a wolf in sheep clothing instead\n\nSuper glad you haven‚Äôt had this experience but this topic of cishet men claiming to be bi/pan to fuck a trans dude because and also having a thing for ‚Äúcorrective rape‚Äù is a very common type of chaser that many trans men deal with. If you haven‚Äôt and have never had any negative experience as a trans guy from cis men in terms of them not seeing you as a man or fetishizing you then that‚Äôs great but you are an exception. Cis men don‚Äôt need you white knighting like this as most of them do in face oppress and fetishizing trans men"

However, ‚Äúgenders more marginalized than that‚Äù‚Ä¶maybe the difference is that I see myself as the same gender as cis men, not as a different gender. After all I honestly think you need more self respect before we even discuss your opinion of cis men. \n\nAlso, you think I‚Äôm only arguing about what‚Äôs good or bad for cis men but I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs detrimental to trans men to feel like everyone‚Äôs out to get them to this extent. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some trauma in there and I‚Äôm sorry about that, but this extreme fear isn‚Äôt helping. Also, we need allies and if we assume everyone is a transphobe we‚Äôll push people away. One of my biggest irl allies from when I didn‚Äôt pass well who made my transition at work easier is a cishet guy (and no, he didn‚Äôt want to have sex with me), I doubt he would have supported me if I‚Äôd been like ‚Äúewww no you‚Äôre just a creepy cishet man out to get my vagina!!‚Äù because wtf lol. \n\nI 100% advocate for being careful who you have sex with or date, so we don‚Äôt disagree there. I did already say I filter people and look out for the red flags. But I go into it assuming nothing. You go into it assuming the worst and telling everyone to do that, and honestly assuming every cis man you come in contact with is out to get you and has this rather uncommon kink (most chasers want us for being ‚Äúexotic‚Äù, not even ‚Äúto fix us‚Äù) is kinda weird. \n\nI sill give you that, most posts on reddit are indeed negative, but that makes sense. People post more when they have issues than when they don‚Äôt. People in happy relationships don‚Äôt usually go on reddit to rant about it. There are a ton of guys on r/gaytransguys for example who had positive experiences too. \n\nOP asked ‚Äúis this what I should expect for everyone‚Äù and the answer is frankly ‚Äúno‚Äù. He should be more careful, yes. But no, I won‚Äôt agree he should assume all cis men have this weird conspiracy to turn him into a woman.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm not white knighting for random cis men (and especially not for the guy OP dealt with), I‚Äôm ‚Äúwhite knighting‚Äù for cool people I know who happen to be cis guys. This kind of assumption will only push people who would be potential allies away, and make life more difficult because living in fear is not fun. Caution, yes. Default fear, no."

Not trusting the average  cis men doesn‚Äôt make me not a man considering, statistically, cis men are the least trans positive or gender affirming group in society across multiple studies. I‚Äôm a man. I don‚Äôt need cis male friendship or validation to prove that \n\nCis male allies and friends, the few that I have are the ones that have opened up to me about how cis men actually feel about trans guys. I‚Äôve had conversations with cis men of a variety of sexual orientations and because I‚Äôm not desperate for their validation nor begging for their friendship they can be honest with me. They admit that many cis men don‚Äôt see trans men as male and many will claim some form of queerness in order to get access to the sexual parts they desire. I‚Äôve had cis men admit to me they viewed their trans male partners as closer to women than not and felt guilty about it or didn‚Äôt see their relationship as gay. They‚Äôd never tell their partner that though because they‚Äôd lose sexual and emotional labor access. \n\nI‚Äôve seen trans guys on r/gaytransguys silence other trans men who have had bad experiences with cis men or are more or less than positive about cis males as a collective. Typically guys with experiences like OP get victim blamed or shamed for just not picking ‚Äúone of the good ‚Äú cis guys bye nobody talks about how cis men view trans men and how that causes toxic interactions. Enough trans guys all over social media have talked about cis male chasing and fetishizing us especially those that don‚Äôt pass that it‚Äôs almost a meme in our communities. Not all these trans guys had low self esteem many were manipulated into thinking a cis man was respectful and affirming until he wasn‚Äôt \n\nPlease don‚Äôt make assumptions about what friends or allies I have. I have cis male friends I vet  them but if one of them turned out to not see me as a man or had some type of detrans/misgendering fantasy towards me or some other trans man‚Ä¶I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.  I like my cis male friends but I don‚Äôt trust them to be anything other than the cis men they are which means I believe they will put their interests and attractions as cis men above my manhood as a trans  man. Ive come to expect that and I work with cis men within the context that they behave and within the culture they ascribe too. If my caution about cis men makes some not want to hang out with me then that‚Äôs fine. \n\nAlso I‚Äôm a different kind of man to a cis man but that doesn‚Äôt make me not a man. I‚Äôm proudly a trans guy and would not wish to be a cis man so bad that o whitewash the bigotry and attitudes many cis man have towards trans men. \n\nSorry but your method of going in blind and expecting a unicorn is why so many trans men end up in relationships with toxic cis men that then other gay trans guys blame them for. Please don‚Äôt assume the levels of self respect I have either. Just because I don‚Äôt assume all cis men are magically the one of the few good ones doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have self respect. Just because I‚Äôve been abused by cis men doesn‚Äôt mean my lack of self respect is to blame sometimes cis men abuse trans men because they‚Äôre transphobic. Sometimes cis men are bad people with prejudices that they accept due to their culture and seek to enact and abuse people with their cis male privilege. Sometimes a trans guy isn‚Äôt at fault for cis males abusing him."

I'm not Australian but I just did some research because I had a hunch there were some things to do with her school.\n\nWhat I found was good (better than in my own country lol). According to Queensland Human Rights Commission, your daughter should be allowed to change her name and gender (including how she is referred in language but also her uniform, the toilets she uses...) in school if and when she wants. [(Source.)](https://www.qhrc.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/24535/QHRC_TransAtSchool_forschools.pdf) \n\nMedically, it seems she would be able to access trans care (puberty blockers or hormones) if you and her other parent (if there is one) agree on it. It may seem scary (and she might not even want it, yet or ever) but there can be big advantages. Psychically, it can help her live her teenage years more happily. Physically, it can prevent the Rutherford development of \"masculine characteristics\" and minimize the necessity for surgeries or medical treatments when adult (to be clear it will not spare her for having to take hormones, but it could prevent her for needing facial feminization surgery or laser hair removal). \n\nI'm giving you all these informations so you have them but you obviously shouldn't rush anything.

It's just plain easier sometimes to pretend that you didn't hear it than it is to correct the person who deadnamed or misgendered.\n\nBut the thing is: we hear it hundreds of times a day - often from people who don't even actively mean us harm or disrespect.  But correct them we must, or nothing will ever change.   Having to do this dozens of times a day is really fucking exhausting.

Seriously and completely. It's okay to slip up, but don't do it on purpose. She is a girl. But she's also still the same person you knew. Probably happier but I would bet that she has the same interests except for any that he might have been suppressing or hiding, she'll like the same games though probably different clothes, and your memories with her aren't invalidated she still remembers them and they're still good memories even if she wasn't exactly who she wanted to be in some ways I promise.\n\nI still remember sitting on the couch and playing Wii games with my mom. I still love those memories. I still remember getting dressed up in a suit and tie every year on my birthday. Would I have rather it been a dress, yes, but I still love those moments.\n\nI want to clarify that you aren't losing anything except for the word \"son,\" and all you really have to do is be a good dad. Think of it less like a boy trying to become a girl and a girl who has a hormone condition that makes her look like a boy. What would you do for a kid in that situation? you would help them get medicine, and you would help them feel feminine. You would tell them they're pretty. You would never tell them that they aren't a real woman.\n\nUltimately, it boils down to don't be weird about it. It's a change, and it's going to be somewhat difficult, but don't be weird about it. One of the most powerful things my Dad ever did was just continue to be annoying about the differences in our political views when it comes to capitalism. I know that seems weird, but it was normal, and it showed that nothing really had to change because it doesn't not in any really major ways.\n\nAlso, keep her safe. This world is kind of not super great right now and that's where I'll leave it off, don't let her walk alone in any place you wouldn't let a cisgender woman Walk Alone and maybe in some places where you might."

To keep supporting her as a transgender girl, focus on using her chosen name and pronouns (she/her), as this is the simplest and most affirming thing you can do.

Take time to educate yourself on transgender issues so you can better understand her journey and the challenges trans people face. Stand up for her if she faces prejudice, whether in your neighborhood or at school, and help her find a supportive community of people who understand her. Let her explore her identity at her own pace and be there for her emotionally. It‚Äôs also okay to seek out counseling or support groups for both of you‚Äîthis can help navigate any struggles.

    "comment_body": "Hi, FtM here (girl to boy transgender), and first of all, you‚Äôre already being an amazing father by just merely supporting her- if she came out to you, that shows just how much she trusts and loves you. If it was a matter of you finding out from something like one of her friends accidentally forgetting to deadname her in front of you, or something along those lines, don‚Äôt take this as offense or she not trusting you, but rather her being scared of all the horror stories she‚Äôs heard online or on the news of parents kicking out/disowning/sometimes even attacking their children after they come out, a lot of the trans communities around the world are going through dark times indeed.\n\nFor the next while, adapt as best as you can to her new name and pronouns. I know this part will be a bit difficult, not because of lack of acceptance, but because you have to retrain your muscle memory after you‚Äôve been calling someone you‚Äôve known for more than a decade by a different name and set of pronouns. As long as you correct yourself whenever you say something wrong, she will understand. If she corrects you, know that she just wants to help you get used to it, as opposed to her trying to ‚Äòcall you out‚Äô or something among those lines.\n\nIf she is below 18 (or just under your care financially), and you can afford it, I suggest looking into a therapist that specializes in gender identity/LGBTQIA+ if she isn‚Äôt already seeing a therapist. Once you have gathered a few reputable therapists‚Äô links, send these links to her and ask her if SHE would like to see any of them- ensure that these therapists aid their LGBTQIA+ clients through any mental troubles that may stem from the societal pressure of being transgender, as opposed to trying to get them to ‚Äòconform‚Äô to society or even covert conversion therapy. I don‚Äôt know the laws/healthcare in Australia/Queensland, so I don‚Äôt know how much it would be to get a good therapist, or how long of a waitlist there may be. And please keep in mind that not every therapist is an amazing one-size-fits-all psychologist, and she may go through one or two or five until she finds one that makes her feel comfortable and gives her good advice that she can really apply (personally, I went through TEN, but the one who ended up being perfect for me was the one I myself chose, not my parents who chose for me without letting me have a say!).\n\nKnow that it is NOT your obligation to pay for your daughter‚Äôs medical transition, but she will forever appreciate it if you do- if you are in a well-off place financially and can afford it easily, then definitely chip in if you can, but if you‚Äôre struggling with money, she will understand that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay for it all, especially if Australia healthcare is anything like USA‚Äôs, having to pay thousands out of pocket because your insurance doesn‚Äôt view surgeries/hormones as medically necessary‚Ä¶\n\nAs others have suggested, buying her clothes that she wants will definitely help with her confidence- if she doesn‚Äôt like going out to buy clothes because she doesn‚Äôt like trying on clothes as it causes her great self-esteem issues, then order clothes online for her from a company that will allow you to send back clothes if they do not fit, as long as the tags are still attached (which I believe nowadays is most big companies). Definitely ask her if she wants to go out to buy clothes with you (or, if she wanted to go with friends, if she wanted a bit of cash to pay for clothes), or if there‚Äôs any links to any clothes she wants that you could pay for online.\n\nAnd as many have said, just being there for her through it all is the biggest thing any child could ask for. Know that there‚Äôs a chance that her identity may change if she‚Äôs not completely sure- she may be Non-binary, or agender, genderfluid, even just gender non-conforming cisgender, but let her know that you will love her regardless for who SHE is, and being her being queer wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. Listen to her wants, and what she thinks is best for her, and you‚Äôll continue to be the number one father of the year!"

The biggest thing is maybe accepting that once in a while you might do things wrong, and that's ok. As long as you keep trying and talking to her. Every trans woman is different but try to think of her as a woman and go forward from there. What would it be like raising a daughter? Help her buy bras and makeup. Use whatever pronouns she prefers, and don't be afraid to use them in front of other people. \n\nAlso, I would ask her about medication and if she plans to medically transition. If she does, be there for her, help her keep on top of whatever medication she needs (in her teens it would probably be puberty blockers, but I imagine she would start estrogen and testosterone blockers soon ‚Äì it depends). This can be confusing for trans people at the start of transition so we all need a friend to help us keep on top of it. \n\nKeep it up. You're doing great.

(I suggest a wig with bangs or a fringe because those have the most natural hairline without seeing the lace) \n\n-buy some makeup for her. I suggest little starter things like some foundation, mascara, foundation powder, blush and highlighter. And a couple things like some makeup brushes and a beauty blender. \n\n-For me personally I changed schools because of bullying. I did homeschooling for a little while I worked on my transition and did my best to pass and when I was confident enough I transferred to a different public school. \n\nThe best thing you can do as a father to better understand your child is to watch some of these clips on YouTube!! When I transitioned I wanted to educate my parents more so I showed them these \n\n[https://youtu.be/qJdafLVf6xo?si=AOwTw7H64IlRBsuk](https://youtu.be/qJdafLVf6xo?si=AOwTw7H64IlRBsuk)\n\n\n[https://youtu.be/qe_n5UgJod4?si=0EjtyuR8gMKIxtLD](https://youtu.be/qe_n5UgJod4?si=0EjtyuR8gMKIxtLD)\n\nHope this helps!"

There is a PDF there with a summary and a video with detailed explanations, there is a graphical explanation there, etc.\n\nEsp. the graphical explanation could help understand that important is how people feel inside and not outer body parts, and that its a spectrum.\n\nAnd in the PDF are a few more detailed explanations.\n\nIt may be an option to show one or both, and talk them through with others in case. It could help explain to relatives etc.\n\nIf you are in a southern state, contacting local lgbt places first though and asking how to proceed best would be advisable.\n\nAnd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/explaining/index#wiki_for_parents) was a hint to a book for parents of kids up to college age, and there are hints there concerning places of support. [PFLAG](https://pflag.org/needsupport) for example may support lgbt people and also parents and relatives, and they may help explain.\n\nAnd for the kid [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/s4khww/i_dont_know_how_to_feel_i_feel_like_im_trans_but/htfx7u8/) might be some resources that could help them go towards what they feel they would like step by step, there are hints there concerning small things that could be used regularly for motivation, there are explaining resources there, and there are also hints there concerning looking for support. And there are hints there concerning looking for a gender therapist in case.\n\nAnd treatment until puberty usually is only social, like changes to presentation and pronouns etc. In puberty adding blockers would be recommendable. They just stop a development towards the gender assigned at birth. It would be reversible in case. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/explaining/index#wiki_blockers) might be a number of explaining resources. And after puberty HRT may be an option. Surgeries often are only done after people are of age. And not all people want surgeries.\n\nAnd it may be an idea to discuss with a med person something like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/1gl2v5y/dont_panic/lvrj8bl/) in case.\n\nThank you for being supportive.\n\n\n*hugs*"

Kids in Aussie schools can be pretty brutal, so having that support at home is very necessary\n\nI have had quite a few friends transition (male to nonbinary, female to male ect) and while it definitely will be a knew experience and it will take some time to get used to, being their for her is one of the best things you can do.\n\nA good way for her to feel comfortable in her body is to allow her to experiment with styles and looks, she needs to find her own person now. Thrift shops/Op shops are a great way to start since theirs basically every genre of clothing there.\n\nTalk to her about her transition, ask about what she wants, does she want to transition publicly? Or does she want to keep it private while she‚Äôs working things out? Does she want to try more feminine things that she may not have tried before? (Like make up\nAnd skirts)\n\n¬†(also I know makeup is for everyone and men can wear skirts to but since they‚Äôre typically ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù it can really help youths to find themselves or express themselves)\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to parade around with a trans flag waving in the air or loudly announcing it, but as long as your supportive and willing to stand up for her, I know she‚Äôll be okay :)"

    "comment_body": "You are off to a better start than most other father's I know. I do have a few things to add to this list of actions to try and make her transition as easy as possible and your support as much as possible. These are things to consider and actions I would recommend:\n\n\n-Support her through her transitional period by any means you are able to. Being there for her emotionally and physically when possible is going to do wonders for her.¬†\n\n\n-Do some research on what trans people tend to go through on a social and mental level. Understanding what she will go through on a daily basis, the mental yo-yoing she will go through with gender euphoria and dysphoria will help you understand a lot of what she is dealing with and how to best approach her\n\n\n-Research into common MtF (Male to Female) procedures that she would go through, such as Hormone Replacement Therapy. You don't need to know every single procedure and surgery, but at least reviewing the more commonly done things will help.¬†\n\n\n-Take her shopping for clothes she wants to wear. If she wants to wear traditionally feminine clothing, take her to a store that will let her be able to do that. Let her buy whatever she wants that she, or, if she is without a job and you are willing, you can afford. No need for either of you to hurt yourselves financially and make things harder over clothing. As said earlier, I would recommend thrift shops or pre-used clothes stores like Goodwill.¬†\n\n\n-Understand the dangers she will face. I do not know how it is everywhere, but I know that we are at higher risks of being victims of hate crimes and being assaulted by people. I feel this goes without saying, but be weary of people and protect your baby girl as best you can.¬†\n\n\nSome other things to consider:\n\n\n-HRT does cause mood swings as a potential symptom, so your daughter may be uncharacteristically emotional if she decides to take it. That is par for the course. Just try to understand the reasons for the mood swings. Now obviously... Don't take shit from anyone that you wouldn't normally take shit from, but know she might become more manic, more emotional, more quick to snap, or more reactionary than normal.¬†\n\n\n-Since she will become a woman, she will go through all the joys and hardships a woman will go through and will try and act/ live accordingly. Do your best to use her new names, pronouns, and engage with her in ways she wants to be engaged. As long as you are trying, then you are good. She will know the difference between trying and faking. A deadnaming or misgendering does hurt a lot, but it stings less (at least for me) if I know the person is genuinely sorry for the action and is trying to change.¬†\n\n\nNot all Trans experiences and outcomes are the same. Everyone's journey is different and the destinations are all where we want to be in. As long as she is happy with herself and you are supportive of her choices regarding her trans identity, then you are doing a great job. I find it endearing that you are trying to learn and help her. Keep it up sir!¬†\n\n\n\n\n... Also sorry for the long response."

Not sure how possible that is for you - but there are likely more options than you expect if you're willing to look outside your comfort zone.\n\n\nIf she is close to university / moving out age then perhaps you could help her by supporting her in her own \"escape plan\" from the area.\n\n\nIf you/she wants to stay in the area then a lot will depend on how others in the area recieve her. Being from an insular rural area (albeit quite progressive / centrist in many ways) and knowing people from rough areas - I know it isn't a death sentence to be from somewhere like this. If you are known and liked as a person by folks in the community then you can sometimes be seen as \"the weird person who is alright actually\". Alternatively they can be extremely dangerous if you don't have that support network. Again - I don't know your situation well enough to tell you what to do.\n\n\nA few things I can say are this;\n- Telling her to just suppress it is not a good longterm solution. It will cause quite a lot of psychological harm. It can be a short term survival stratagy - but you need to be working on an escape plan if that is the case.\n- You can't protect her from all harm. Bullies are like sharks and can smell blood from miles away, she will need to face her own battles.\n- That being said - you can be her most zealous supporter and defender. You can be there to help her on her journey, support her when bad things have happened and speak up if anyone tries anything in front of you.\n\n\nGood luck mate :)"

I know this is an ignorant question. I'm not trying to be hurtful. Please be nice... üòÖ)"

How they get me to a similar state is fine by me too. I'm also more attracted to them as a person than the genitals. Sounds like you're kinda similar, maybe you have a preference, but seems like they're a means to an end, not the end itself.\n\n\nIf she thinks trans men are like butch lesbians, find some feminine trans men and show how it's clear they're not like cis women anymore. They look like men, they have masculine features, they often don't want you talking about any feminine body features they have, etc.¬†"

That's OP's friend, and that's maybe what you picture when you picture a straight woman.\n\nA bunch of straight women are not put off by that, because the way they parse gender and sex and their own straightness or what have you isn't quite so genital-focused. That's OP.\n\nProbably, when you picture \"straight\" you picture someone more like the first person. You adjust that by recognizing that straight people don't all have the same relationship to sex and gender and all that as each other.

So a lot of it depends on context, like specifically what OP's friend is doing, but here's some suggestions:\n\n* interrupting the friend whenever she refers to OP's boyfriend with she/her pronouns. Like the second OP's friend says \"she\" OP would jump in and say \"actually it's he.\" (Side note, I train dogs, this is basically clicker training for pronouns)\n* taking the friend aside and saying something like \"Hey, it really bothers me when you refer to my boyfriend as a woman or a masculine lesbian. Could you please tell me what makes you say that?\" \n* if the friend says \"well \\[boyfriend\\] has a vagina,\" OP could say something like \"so genitals don't equal pronouns.\"\n* if the friend persists in misgendering OP's boyfriend, OP could start misgendering the friend/people close to the friend. It's snarky and rude, but so is persistent & willful misgendering in the first place. (Another side note, I have a relative who persistently and willfully deadnames me and she's been married twice. Sometimes I think about using the last name of her first husband while addressing her. Or her full first name -- she goes by a nickname. It's the same logic of \"well it's your *legal* name\"). The goal is to be unnecessarily petty to point out the unnecessary pettiness of refusing to apply the same social norms to trans people that we easily apply to cis people.\n* if the friend is just really dead-set on misgendering OP's boyfriend, and depending on how much OP wants to die on this hill / how serious the relationship becomes, detaching from and maybe even ending the friendship! I'm NC with my parents, and before they were ever transphobic about me they were absolutely homophobic about my gay friends in high school. Before actually going NC I slowly detached from them by not telling them things about my life, because they made it clear I couldn't mention being friends with gay people without it becoming a *huge* problem. Their bigotry (among other things) ended our relationship, but I'm not going to deny them the consequences of their actions. Like I think an equivalent question for cis people is \"would you accept these remarks being made about a cis man?\" Like if you had a friend who referred to your cis het boyfriend as \"such a girl\" and said that you giving him head was \"eating pussy\" and implied that you were a lesbian for dating him because he's so girly... would you tolerate that?

Help her find stuff that actually fits and looks good on her!! Split the costs, or just buy it for her as a gift.\n\n\\- Accompany her to the bathroom while in public; seriously, it's a scary experience for trans women and having someone who you KNOW is on your side can be life-saving.\n\n\\- For sex: If she's pre-op, don't assume she'll top or want to use her penis. Have the strapon and lots of lube ready to go. If you're giving her oral, treat the head of the penis like a clit. Eat out her taint.\n\n\\- Allow her to be emotional and vulnerable with you!! It's really hard to express affection as a trans woman for fear of being seen as \"creepy\" and we've often been punished for being vulnerable throughout our lives. Give her a hug and cuddle together on the bed/couch."

I'm middle-aged and barely passable but I still manage to gather a crowd.\n\nIt's harder for my partner who's very clearly male and needs first to explain that he has a vagina to any potential play partner.\n\nIt sounds as if the women at your parties are just making excuses for not putting themselves about enough and using you as a convenient scapegoat.  That's just being nasty and I'm sorry it's happening.\n\nIf you've got an online group for these events (Signal, Telegram etc.)  it's probably worth getting yourself known there.  A few friendly posts demonstrating how you're one of the good guys might help get them on your side and start to ease their resentment.

It's not your problem that guys don't like them or they're jealous that you get attention they don't feel like you deserve to have.

If you look at them with a mentality of scarcity, you will find that in spades as well.\n\nSo get along with as many people as you want, find connections, and have fun.

    "comment_body": "I'm not aware of specific sources that would give a single narrative, but stuff might be out there. This below is a combination of stuff I have read, talked to others about, or experienced myself; I've been mainly on the US west coast and came out as trans in 2002.\n\nUntil pretty recently it was widely thought that ftm spectrum people were rare or even nonexistent. If you look at informational books about transness before the last twenty or so years, whether academic or for a mass audience, they'll generally either explicitly say trans men are a small minority compared to trans women, or will simply take for granted that they don't exist. And up until even more recently, rather than see reference to nonbinary people at all, you'll generally see references to crossdressers and perhaps \"transgenderists\" who are all assumed to be mtf spectrum; at most, drag may be mentioned and then you might see mention of drag kings. This is tied in with popular acceptable behavior and presentation by gender: even now, a woman who wears traditionally men's clothes is nowhere near as transgressive or controversial as a man who wears traditionally women's clothes. A woman who wears traditionally men's clothes is commonly thought of as doing work that women's clothes don't support well, or is alternative, or is a lesbian. A man who wears traditionally men's clothes is overwhelmingly thought of as doing it for sexual reasons -- and sexual in a way that \"she dresses like a man, she must be a lesbian\" isn't classically thought of as sexual. In particular, masculine lesbians are historically often imagined as asexual. (Transgenderist is an outdated term for people who pursued an \"incomplete\" medical transition like hormones without genital surgery, which at the time was considered explicitly sexual and against the practices of the few trans clinics in practice from a time that transness was considered vanishingly rare.)\n\nA dive into both trans and feminist thought will hit on some of the background of that difference. Julia Serrano's *Whipping Girl* is a good if dated read there -- the original is quite dated and problematic despite the great content, so reading more recent editions is recommended if only to see Serrano's contextualization. Second wave lesbian feminist thought is instrumental here too for exploring the ways in which queer women's sexuality has often been simply ignored and treated as not truly sexual, where queer men's sexuality has been overwhelmingly criminalized in comparison.\n\nThis all influences people's options for how to do transness before trans communities were like they are now, before even transition was really available the way it is now. It also influences the shape of queer men's and queer women's communities, where trans people before trans communities might find space and start exploring. And it's far more common to find queer men's communities that exclude wearing women's clothes at all, than to find the reverse in queer women's communities. Conservative queer communities that simply mirror the transphobic status quo are likely to permit women wearing men's clothes and not men wearing women's clothes.\n\nAfter WWII we get the invention and widespread distribution of the photocopier. This is huge, as it makes independent publishing possible, especially for small form stuff like magazines. And so alternative communities start using those to connect. The [Digital Transgender Archive](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/) and [University of Victoria Transgender Archive](https://www.uvic.ca/transgenderarchives/index.php) both have a wealth of these that can be worth digging through. A lot of magazines of the time, unsurprisingly, were smut or stuff widely perceived as smut: it's independent press, hey. Two other things are happening in the postwar period. During the war, men went to fight, women took on jobs commonly considered men's while at home. And so, during the war you had this expansion of social presentation options for women (the original [Rosie the Riveter](https://www.singulart.com/en/blog/2024/03/30/rosie-the-riveter-by-norman-rockwell/) as a great example) that never quite went away, though it did shrink back in the conservative wave after the war. So there's an increase in possibilities for proto ftm spectrum people. You also during that time had a bunch of men all bundled up together for years in a highly structured and hierarchical environment. Not all were gay, but yeah, this is the seads of modern leather, and when these men got back from the war they often formed communities in motorcycle gangs that more directly evolved into gay leather as we know it. And...that doesn't produce anything for mtf spectrum people; if anything, this is part of a wave of queer men's communities pushing proto mtf spectrum people out (again along with that conservative wave).\n\nSo, a lot of those early magazines building trans communities are smut directly, or are simply using the permission in that magazine space to talk about something that would be considered smut even when nonsexual. That was used for community-building among mtf crossdressers and early transgenderists and transsexuals, newly finding access to whatever medical transition was relevant to them. But they could usually find a skirt somehow and a place to hide it, and could privately connect over that. And that's the seeds of the modern trans-centric play party. There wasn't really a parallel thing happening for contemporary ftm spectrum people: where they were expressing their genders similarly, they were more readily able to engage in queer women's communities or simply hide in plain sight.\n\nSo, as ftm spectrum people became more visible, they tended to simply make space in queer women's communities. There's another long and messy history of this inclusion of ftm spectrum people that often came with simultaneous exclusion of mtf spectrum people; iirc Susan Stryker's *Transgender History* has a good section on that. Of course, plenty of ftm spectrum people were not queer women. I know Lou Sullivan is commonly referenced for talking about this experience in the 70s and 80s, but what he did was largely just move directly into the gay men's community; the gay leather community, with its highlighting of masculinity, has wound up on the leading edge of kinky ftm spectrum inclusion, despite its historical roots that pushed mtf spectrum folks into their own spaces.\n\nYou also have a growth of more generalized kink spaces and organizations over these decades, as different groups find that it isn't necessary to share every kink with others in order to form community (but maybe you're not going to read every magazine relevant to this larger community). Generalization was about building community between leather and BDSM and fetish and so on, but often it also was about bridging together straight and queer kinksters -- and trans ones too. So these spaces became important venues for trans people without meaningful transition options to connect, and those trans specific. It's not that all mtf spectrum people were going to those parties; many just went to the same events cis people were going to. The trans specific parties were primarily there to center gender play itself, which for many of them wasn't a kink -- instead, these parties were the only place they could express their genders. They held varying relevance for those who had transitioned and expressed their genders in everyday life; some continued going because they were well established in that particular community, some never had those specific community ties so it didn't matter, and some specifically wanted to go to other parties in order to focus on other kinks.\n\nIn the early-mid 90s, early-mid 00s, and early-mid 10s (yes, it kept happening), there were major waves of increasing trans visibility. The first wave is primarily marked by a shift of terminology from transsexual to transgender, as control over the narrative of transness shifted from the medical community to trans people ourselves; the second wave is primarily marked by the rising awareness of ftm spectrum people, leading to a sharp increase in people knowing transition was an option for them in the first place; and the third wave is primarily marked by a similar experience for nonbinary people, along with the widespread awareness that one could be nonbinary and trans at the same time, rather than nonbinary as a spot on a spectrum between trans and cis. A major impact of those waves was that many specifically gay kink spaces, which have largely centered masculinity, adopted or more actively enforced trans exclusionary policies targeting ftm spectrum folks. This has shifted heavily toward inclusion finally, but it took a long time. So, we focused on these generalized, \"pansexual\" kink spaces. The well-established trans-specific parties we found already attached to those spaces were...well, broadly not for us. Not just because \"trans-centered\" as noted above actually meant centering gender play, but also because the gender focus was well established thematically: \"pretty maid\" parties and such. Yes, ftm spectrum people can be as feminine as anyone else, I am and was, but the message of who and what the events were for was clear. Sometimes, ftm spectrum folks went anyway, and often the existing attendees were happy to share their space with new friends. And sometimes that lead to those parties shifting focus and purpose. Sometimes the gender play focus was maintained as a core part, but broadened to include all genders; and sometimes, the trans inclusion itself was centered, with gender play still welcomed but decentered.\n\nLong brain dump. For going to kink parties, depending on your area, often the generalized parties are pretty trans welcoming. Trans specific parties vary so widely in purpose and community engagement that it's hard to generalize beyond saying, take a look and see if it's for you."

But I sort of grasp what the downvoted poster is trying to convey.\n\nI used to write about these concepts for the Cisnormativity Project back during the early ‚Äô10s ‚Äî the difference between *passing* versus *being placed [by others] as*. [I also wrote considerably about finding our own language, on our own terms, to describe our experiences as trans folks in ways which didn‚Äôt rely on cis gatekeeper terminologies.]\n\nNamely, the former ‚Äî to *pass* ‚Äî places an onus of active intervention by a subject (i.e., here, a trans person) to strive to fit into prescriptive ends/expectations. To *be placed as*, meanwhile, flips that script by placing onus on the way *other* people (i.e., observers of a subject) are placing/categorizing that subject. \n\nThe benefit of flipping the script here is a subject, like a trans person, can focus less energy and time on fitting a mould and more on the state of existing in place and letting others deal with their stuff. \n\nGranted, this also means flipping another script: one‚Äôs internal dialogue. \n\nWith me, once I began to focus on *being placed as* my gender, rather than *passing*, it began with a kind of letting go: I adopted an ‚Äúevery cis person knows‚Ä¶‚Äù as my baseline, and appending with ‚Äú‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm never bringing up my transness with them regardless.‚Äù Whether true or not was not the point: it meant I could free up that (considerable) cognitive energy and focus on other stuff.\n\nEventually, it reached a point when I‚Äôd be sitting on first supper dates with another trans person. Although I‚Äôd *think* they‚Äôd place me as trans as themselves, it would take them having to explain something such as trans endocrine medication 101 (such as when they had to keep excusing themselves to the washroom, because spiro/diuretic). I‚Äôd nod vociferously as they‚Äôd explain the situation, trying to convey, ‚ÄúYes, yes, I know‚Ä¶‚Äù until I finally had to pause them to say, ‚ÄúSo you *do* know I‚Äôm trans and have also been through this, right?‚Äù\n\nThat discussion probably wouldn‚Äôt have happened had I continued to rely on the active involvement of *passing*. *I* looked the same, but how others placed me had changed.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading."

More and more that happens today reminds me of the 20s moving into the 30s.  Uber wealth concentration; consrrvative notions taking precedence.  Pissed off populations."

Scotland already threatened her with jail time. its only a matter of time before she actually says something and gets arrested for it and becomes obsolete. she is flirting with that line as it is.  She \"Wrote\" a few books, made a bunch of money form it, She is not in government or is she a person of influence in any real ways that matter.

People is because she is literally been shit on for years about not being a feminist because her main female character Hermione Granger has been regarded as a mother figure for Ron and Harry throughout the series Which many journalist and magazine articles have stated as a bad look for women, especially when the movies came out in the early 2000s so essentially, she wants to paint herself as a feminist when in reality she‚Äôs not, and never has been I feel like if J. K. Rowling had actually been a feminist when she wrote the Harry Potter books. She would‚Äôve made Hermione a main character because in the late 90s early, 2000s there weren‚Äôt a lot of books that had a female protagonist. The only book I can actively think of that had a female protagonist was Stephen King‚Äôs firestarter or Carrie but that made sense for someone like Stephen King, who was always provided himself as a leftist or democrat, which is very much shown in his writings where I feel like J. K. Rowling is more of a showman who wants to pretend she has beliefs and values when in reality she just follows the grain."

While transgender just speaks to not aligning your gender with the sex you were assigned at birth‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to want to change your body at all to be transgender. Most transsexual people are also transgender, it‚Äôs just that we‚Äôre *also* transsexual because we want to change our bodies ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è \n\nIt‚Äôs a term that‚Äôs being pretty widely reclaimed by trans theorists, because it speaks to the fact that trans people who medically transition aren‚Äôt just changing our gender‚Äîwe‚Äôre also changing our sex. You don‚Äôt need to change your sex to change your gender, and transgender people shouldn‚Äôt have to feel any pressure to change their bodies if they don‚Äôt feel the need to. But some of us really need to, and that‚Äôs important for us to acknowledge by also using the term transsexual.\n\nOf course transmedicalists say only transsexuals are ‚Äòreally‚Äô trans‚Äîwhich is fucking insane, because there have been tons of trans people through history and plenty of them are comfortable in their bodies. Saying that only people who want medical transition (or the right kind of medical transition) are really trans is just gatekeeping bullshit."

I have 2 genderqueer children (one identifies as gender fluid, the other as trans/nonbinary). I can translate the Christian hate for trans people fairly thoroughly, having been raised in it as well as experiencing it second hand through my kiddos. First of all, Christians will INSIST that they don‚Äôt hate trans people. They simply don‚Äôt think trans people are actually trans. They see in the creation story that God created humans as ‚Äúmale and female‚Äù and in their minds that means whatever you were born as (your sex assigned at birth) is your gender, and it‚Äôs a sin to try to change that. They think it‚Äôs a mental illness to believe your body is the wrong sex, they don‚Äôt understand that there‚Äôs a difference between sex and gender (and most of them don‚Äôt want to learn the difference). They believe they already know everything they need to know based on the simple stories they read in the Bible, so if you try to explain the complexities of gender nonconformity or body dysphoria, they are convinced you‚Äôre trying to undermine their faith with science. So any science that they find inconvenient, they call pseudoscience so they can ignore it. Their favorite phrase is ‚Äòlove the sinner, hate the sin,‚Äô and if you call them out for their hateful behavior toward trans people, they will act offended (‚ÄòWell, I never!‚Äô) because of course they ‚Äòlove everyone‚Äô and they‚Äôre ‚Äòonly trying to help.‚Äô"

The only thing the bible really have to say about gender is that men and women exist (Genesis 1:27) but also that gender in the end doesn't really matter. (Galatians 3:28) Oh, and that one line in Leviticus saying that cross dressing is forbidden, which was part of the old covenant which also included not mixing fabrics, not eating shellfish, and sacrificing farm animals. The old covenant no longer stands because we have Jesus and the new covenant. (Matthew 5:17) The only reason so-called \"Christains\" hate trans people is because their bigoted pastors (false prophets) told them to, and FYI using God's name to spread hatred is breaking the 10 commandments, specifically the ones about \"using the Lord's name in vain\" and \"bearing false witness.\"\n\nThe only thing the bible POTENTIALLY argues against is male homosexuality, but it is a common belief now that those lines in the Bible were primarily condemning the ancient practice of PEDASTRY and ritual prostitution, not consentual homosexual relationships between two adult men. In addition, lesbian relationships are not mentioned once in the bible, and asexuality (chastity) is promoted numerous times. Both Jesus and Paul the Apostle are widely believed by scholars today to be aroace. So most of the LGBT in the bible either goes unmentioned or is actively promoted. The only thing POTENTIALLY condemned is mlm relationships, who's verses are most commonly believed today to actually refer to pedastry, not consentual relationships between two adults like we see today."

Many of them feel they can't accept the validity of trans people, because if they do, they are affirming an unbiblical belief. The implication of the existence of trans people, to them, is either that god isn't infallible, (because he made a mistake in doling out the sexes) or that the patriarchal biblical definitions of masculinity and femininity are invalid, which means the \"word of god\" can be false. So the existence of trans people HAS to be anathema to them, or their faith (could) fall apart theologically as a result. Trans people are inconsistent with their belief system. As a result, instead of adopting a conciliatory stance of holding disparate views in tension, they default to trying to destroy the one that threatens their view, bolstered by ages of confirmation bias. Add to that the intentional demonization and politicization of trans people for the purposes of consolidating power, and the fires of hatred burn even brighter."

Which is not to say it was perfectly egalitarian by our standards before that time, but a lot of scholarship (including some done by queer and trans theologians and historians) indicates that the character of the primitive Church was radically inclusive *for its own time*.\n\n\nIf it had continued in that spirit, things would be very different today.

So maybe some of them for that reason? Idk lol\n\nThe only biblical support is one verse about cross-dressing being an abomination to God. But tbh I've seen hermeneutics on that verse showing that it could've been about a draft dodging technique from back during the times of the disciples. And since social association of gender in clothing and styles change so much overtime, it doesn't make sense to bash crossdressing like that anyway. \n\nIf you think about it, the abomination in that reading of it is the deception. \n\nTrans people are technically born trans. The neurology that determines the gender experience develops from in utero and solidies by age 4-7. God makes us this way. And it would be deceptive to lie about our gender identities and force ourselves to dress in a way that does not affirm that gender. \n\nI think the Bible wants trans people to be themselves.\n\nJesus even says \"some eunuchs were made that way, while others were born that way\".

Most regular individual Christians would take the actual religious teachings at face value and simply \"love thy neighbor\" if it weren't for the fact that it's the nature of Christianity to give certain people power and influence over their beliefs, and if those people in power didn't NEED them all to conform and to punish those who don't.\n\nQuite a bit of the empire of Christianity and all the branches it snakes into seemingly secular society would crumble if the average person fully believed in the mutability and constructedness of gender. Christians' transphobic hate comes from the fear that this will happen. They see more trans and gnc people than they ever did before, and while they've been brainwashed, on some level I think they know that many values they hold exist PURELY to be something to conform to.

This is a lazy way to get people to shut up and not question things. Bc if it was made perfect then it shouldn't be changed. It's a way to silence the question why we don't do thin differently. \nBut a trans person is (in their mind) the literal embodiment of God made a mistake. God didn't make you the \"right\" sex. It asserts that you know better then God. And if you do things that defy God and we'll nothing happens, well then why don't we all start not following the rules of the religion. Let's wear mixed fabrics! Eat some ham!\nBeing trans generally demands that society, and gender roles be questioned. Many high control religions don't like when the flock questions, bc it leads to thinking, and gasp possibly discovering that they're outdated views and practices are bad. If a trans person exists it means other trans people might exist, such as their own children. They're child may see a trans person and grow to question why can't boys wear dresses? Why do women have to stay pure till marriage like the Bible says? Essentially the existence of trans people means to them the loss of control. They can't force a cultural narrative, they can't prop up their view points. Bc just by existing they're whole world order can be called into question. It's a very fragile thing, and proof that such a religion isn't a positive. But I do think this is why some people voice the hate especially loud. It's a sign they're scared that they're entire empire is going to be brought down, so they'll scream all the louder to try and silence the threat. Personally I say let's keep them scared. Let's show the kids boys can wear dresses, and girls can play in mud. Let's question our society and culture a determine for ourselves if we actually want to uphold certain views points. Let's expose high control abusive cult tactics, and let's eliminate the power from those shouting the loudest. Let's eliminate it in the easiest way possible by just existing. Lol bc as we all know there's nothing scarier than seeing a trans person just sitting quietly at a coffee shop, chilling on their phone and drinking a latte."

It's easier to assume it's true and spread the hate around in circles. \n\nNear me there are two churches, [https://www.stpaulsfairfield.org/pride](https://www.stpaulsfairfield.org/pride) and [https://firstchurchfairfield.org/about-us/](https://firstchurchfairfield.org/about-us/) which are both Christian, and VERY welcoming to people of all backgrounds.

Likewise the Church of England came about because the king didn‚Äôt like that Catholicism opposed his desire to divorce.\n\nIn the modern era, both religion and politics are cherry picked by those in positions of power so that only the parts that solidify their control and align with their own personal agendas are disseminated to future generations. Meanwhile, parts that would be less favourable are conveniently omitted or underplayed to the future generations until they fall into archaic obscurity and irrelevance.\n\nEven Christianity and Catholicism themselves remind their faithful that humanity can be inherently deceitful and selfish, that is important to be aware of the proverbial snake in the grass.\n\nIt‚Äôs just that those who blindly follow a faith rarely think to apply those principles to the men (or on rare occasion, women) they look to within the faith.\n\n\nThat‚Äôs not just Christianity and Catholicism mind, that‚Äôs any organisation, religious or otherwise.\n\nJust because you find solace in the scripture doesn‚Äôt mean you should blindly trust whomever insists on reading it to you instead of letting you read it yourself.\n\n\nChristianity, Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism;\nAll can be corrupted by the disingenuous who flock to them for the wrong reasons.

As soon as they found out she was actually trans, it went from accepting her into the community to 'I always knew it was a demon'.\nWho would you trust more? The person who speaks \"the word of God\" or \"the devil\".\n\nEvery single time a transphobe even mentions trans people, it's the most ridiculous made up BS. And it always gets boiled down to 'that is what I was taught as a kid', religious or not.\nEven a lot of trans people are transphobic before they come out. It's so rooted within culture, that no one really questions where it comes from. And if you start questioning something as simple as gender, what other things were you lied to about all your life. It's an uncomfortable feeling to go through this process.\nImagine being able to control what people learned from the beginning. Imagine the advantage of being able to root lies so far down that no one will question you. But then feminism happens, and then gay people, and then trans people. Now you got people questioning your validity all because others want to live their lives. And so you dig deeper and deeper in the pit of lies. 1 low turns to 10 turns to 100.\n\nTL;DR- trans people encourage questioning, which is the worst thing for those who are in power without question. To avoid questions, we become the devil. And you don't make deals with the devil as a Christian."

And this is just the every day flavour of righteous indignation. Now add in anything to do with sexuality and that makes it '1 minute to midnight' in some people's brains.

    "comment_body": "I am not trans but I did grow up in a catholic church till I was about early teens. Though now 37. I am just going to talk on why I think they do, I do not mean to over step and I don't want to cause any harm to anyone part of the LGBTQIA+ community as a whole. Please let me know if my veiw on this is faulty, my veiw is based on listening to comments from cis men growing up, seeing various commentary online, discussing issues of anti-feminism and anti LGBTQIA+ and connections. Personally I strive to be a safe place, as you will never know what words or actions may harm ppl, especially those that you care about. I hope to raise my children to be accepted and accepting to all (unless it is actually harmful, being trans talking about trans and other types of relationships is not harmful in anyway. We include trans/non hetero relationships in discussions often with our kids, as we do not have very mainy ppl in those categories in our lives, and we live in a very conservative area and province sadly where many see discussions of such as child abuse and though I tend to make it very obvious we support those in the community regardless doesn't mean everyone will feel safe with me. I am ok with that, and i will continue to try to improve.) \n\nPersonally I think the hate of trans ppl largely come down to men (especially those part of Christian faiths, though there is other faiths that also seem to talk about it not being allowed, - side tangent cause ADHD- however I truly think majority of religions all have the same based starting religion/story to offer the why to things that would happen or they found but over time the story gets spread it changes, and majority at the base are just about peace,  love, acceptance and trusting that there are things in the universe that can be only explained by a 1 or more gods doing) wanting to be superior, especially to women, so I feel a large amount is based in sexism and hatred of women and their want to over power/control of/have relations with women, so if you have a trans women, they see that as a man reducing themselves to something less than \"man\" they need to attack that. Same with being gay, why would a man let themselves be dominated when they can dominate something lesser, but a trans woman being even less as they \"reduced\" themselves to a woman. However the hate to trans men seem to be less, from what I can see at least, but I am not part of the trans community so please forgive me if this is not true or if stats say otherwise it is just my opinion based on what I have seen/heard. Trans men don't seem to provide the same feeling of the need to dominate over by men, especially if they are male passing, as then cis men see trans men as being part of their club, till they know then they seem to change how they treat the person and resort to treat them as they would a woman or worse. \n\nCis Women seem to have a concern of men taking advantage of them as men have often done. So some women who listen to the men who oppose trans women also will arose trans women cause \"what if they attack me and take advantage of me\" but the truth is they are women,  chances of trans women doing that is no different than chances of cis women doing it probably less even. And then those that listen to those men try and have the same hatred to trans men. \n\nSome ppl aren't aware of the stats or lack certain understanding, or ability to learn things. My ability to learn things beyond what I was exposed to as a child changed the older I became, and the more I explored the world in person, in literature, and online. \n\nSo I think the route cause of ppl hating trans ppl is based in sexism, with fascism, and ignorance to accept facts and new information."

    "comment_body": "The common thread isn‚Äôt Christianity, tho it does seem like it \n\nThere‚Äôs probably a term for this but ya know how sometimes we have authoritarian leaders but the people following them don‚Äôt see them as an authoritarian leader and would regularly profess to not being pro authoritarian? Whatever you call that kind of person, they‚Äôre the common thread. Just so happens a lot of them are Christian‚Äôs\n\nFrom a sociological and theological perspective it could be considered fascinating if it weren‚Äôt so terrifying. Probably will seem morbidly fascinating in like 1-2 hundred years. But it might not even be Christianity‚Äôs fault as much as it just so happened that a few unfortunately clever Republican strategists (tho that wasn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs job title) figured out how many Christian‚Äôs there were in the country and that a lot of them didn‚Äôt vote. \n\nI‚Äôm not certain that‚Äôs where the term silent majority comes from, but for some reason it fits right. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. So anyway they started campaigns to manipulate Christian‚Äôs into associating Christian values with the Republican Party. Not exactly a grand conspiracy, just a bunch of assholes being assholes at the same time\n\nBack in, I wanna say the 70‚Äôs, Christians by and large were pro choice, but a lot of them were pretty racist and not a huge fan of desegregation. Anyway it was the way back then‚Äôs version of the westboro baptist church that started a campaign that to the lay person seemed like it was protecting wittle itlle babies, but to anyone really listening was actually about encumbering people of color with children they hadn‚Äôt planned and weren‚Äôt prepared to raise. But connecting it to the Christian value of not murdering associated with infants was, unfortunately, brilliant. \n\nIt did a lot of work to connect the two parties. Then you know how I said it‚Äôs not a real conspiracy just shity people being shity. Well the ability to gain power by manipulating folks like this was very attractive to horrible people. So the Republican Party flipped. What once argued against slavery became the preferred home of anyone with a really shitty thought. \n\nBut abortion didn‚Äôt work as the it issue for republicans very long. It still had weight but it wasn‚Äôt turning any tides. Some of the shitty people involved in the politics of it(like not the general public) figured out that what is even more effective for wrangling republican voters than the abortion issue is the stuff hitler was doing right before the camps. Just blame it on a small group that most of your voters have too little exposure to truly know anything about, but just enough exposure that when you tell them that ____ marginalized group is coming for your ______. \n\nThat was the game for decades. More and more money got involved. Eventually there were only like 6 real democrats, and more importantly the republicans needed Latinx votes. So they stopped spitting a lot of their previous horrifying rhetoric against Latinx people. They‚Äôd already had to stop being raciest against African Americans out loud, and for most of the politicians the racism is purely performative, so why not?\n\nThe only problem was, who‚Äôs left? They tried just with gay people in general but that didn‚Äôt really work. Tons of straight people knew at least one gay person well enough to know that they don‚Äôt eat babies. I‚Äôm sure you can see where this is going. We were the perfect target for politically weaponized hateful bigotry. We‚Äôre one of the smallest marginalized groups, ton‚Äôs of bull shit about us is still established in the public consciousness, and we started getting seen more. More trans kids then anytime in like maybe 2000 years, I‚Äôm honestly not sure, we‚Äôre growing up without feeling so afraid that it would keep them in the closet. It was easy to point at the fact that more of us are out of the closet being ourselves and call it the liberal left wing media warping your children\n\nThat‚Äôs most of why Christianity is involved generally, and a decent explanation for why the right wing is attacking our rights. Unfortunately for trump it‚Äôs probably real bigotry and not just a performance. But the overall issue is fairly complicated\n\nAll that said It‚Äôs worth pointing out, it has not always been like this. We used to be celebrated as magic by cultures. We were shamans. They saw how we cross a gender line they could fully understand crossing and instead of freaking out they were like ‚Äúholy shit, Kyle looks awesome‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs Kelly now‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh shit. Fuck. My bad. Kelly‚Äôs hot‚Äù\n\nThat little skit was a joke. But it‚Äôs no joke that even though there‚Äôs been bigotry coming at us for a long time, there is ZERO reason for it. Society isn‚Äôt against us. Some people are just simple, and other people are the kind of evil that takes advantage of that. We are literally just caught in the cross fire"

I am not a native English speaker) \n\nI certainly acknowledge gender dysphoria as a genuine psychiatric condition that disrupts a person's relationship with their own body - and that it causes great emotional distress. Truly an awful situation to be in, especially when sufferers are met with ridicule and contempt.\n\nI cannot in good conscience encourage a friend to put themselves in harms way with surgeries and hormone therapy, in order to imitate something they weren't meant to be. Lopping off healthy organs and overriding the body's natural chemistry with HRT in an attempt to alleviate a psychiatric condition - is not compassionate or even ethical in my eyes. That is a lazy and blatant disregard for the long-term health and safety of someone who is in a vulnerable mental state.\n\nRegardless, trans or not, I'd still spend time with them, listen to all their stories and partake in their interests. I'd cherish that person's unique characteristics and qualities, their talents and their strengths. You can love a person even if you don't agree with them on everything. I would do my best to provide them with a safe and loving space to just exist, laugh, chat and find support for life's ups and downs!\n \nBe their friend, be kind, guide them delicately and gently away from harm, pray for them and invite them to Mass. Help them develop the necessary tools to heal and find peace. As friends should. There is no love in alienation, nor in abandoning a friend to harm and sin."

Who said that it is best to love each other and to love as you love yourselves.  I think Evangelicals go more for the old testament, where it says a eye for an eye, and all that. and they think that the bible is the exact word of God.  The Bible was written by man.  Man wasn't around when the dinosaurs were created. and they were here on this world.  They aren't mentioned in the Bible.  God created the universe as it is.  He might have snapped his finger, ( which goes with the big band theory of how the universe was created).  He created man, but it was a slow process.  God, I think is very subtle. He is slow to bring about change.  He sent his son, Christ to die for our sins.  I have always had a hard time with this.  If you have a child,, and you are proud of that child as he has grown, It would be very hard to let harm happen to him.  I think Christ taught that we should love one another.  Very easy thing to learn.  Be kind to one another and we should believe in him.  But, that lesson doesn't carry as much weight if it just a guy telling us to be nice to each other.  remember God is subtle,  Christ has to get peoples attention.  He does miracles, that gets peoples attention,  Christ didn't hang out with all the people that were in power of the church.  He was in the thick of sin, to help save our souls. \n\nWe are humans, we have behaviors that I don't think have changed for thousands of years.  In baseball, do you think that you could still go to a museum and see the baseball that Babe Ruth hit his last homerun with?   yeah, I think you could. could you get a baseball in the gift shop there that had a stamped impression of Babe Ruth's autograph on it?  Maybe.  See, the thing is that people tend to keep things that are significant to them.  I imagine that somewhere someone kept pieces of the cross that Jesus died on.  Now, there are replicas of that cross every where.  Just like back when Christ was alive, there were religious leaders that felt threatened of losing their power.  just like the evangelicals now.  Sometimes I think that there is a big Ponzi scheme going on in some churches.  Let's face it money is power.  \n\nShort story is, Christians don't hate Trans.  I'm a Christian, and I think I'm trans."

    "comment_body": "As a practicing Catholic Christian that's under the trans umbrella: There are a lot of teachings I grew up hearing that claim transgenderism is sinful, many of which I believed at one point (so so glad I don't anymore). Please don't use this list to hate on trans folks OR on Christians. In general, hating on anyone for their identity is a jerk move. While a many Christians do use their religion to justify hateful and harmful actions, there are many Christians who truly want to love and care for others.\n\n\nAlso, I don't speak for all Catholics, let alone all Christians. The following is a list of things I was told in my lived experience.\n\n\nCW: Transphobic beliefs below. Please take care of yourself and approach with caution.\n\n\n1) Surgically transitioning is disrespecting/mutilating the body that God gave you: Getting \"cosmetic surgery\" in general is frowned upon, so to surgically alter one's sex organs is even worse. Your genitalia is one of the most precious organs because it allows God to create life (and natural conception to natural death is highly revered). Your body is a temple that is meant to be exactly how God made it to be. Humans are body-soul composite. To harm the body is to harm the soul.\n\n\n2) Being trans is self-centered: By focusing on your \"preferred appearances\" and your \"preferred name\" and your \"preferred pronouns\", you focus on \"you you you\" instead of on God. Focusing too much attention on *any* identity outside of your relationship with the Lord is sinful because it's a \"worldly distraction\".\n\n\n3) Presenting as trans causes confusion and scandal: To draw unnecessary attention to oneself and/or to lead others to sin is to cause scandal. By presenting or acting outside of the \"norm\", you draw others' attention away from God on onto yourself. Also, if a man falls for a trans woman or a woman for a trans man, the trans person is \"deceiving\" the other and causing them to be homosexual. These relationships would never work because God cannot create life through their union.\n\n\n4) Transitioning socially and/or medically hinders you from fulfilling your vocation: If you're trans, you can't get married or enter the priesthood/brotherhood/sisterhood. It also distracts you from the reason God put you on this earth."

It's body modification, a subculture, and confusing to boot.\n\nThey don't understand how it can be scientific that being born is just like anything else that can be helped just like if someone is born with 4 fingers or is about to die and receives life saving treatment. It's just too complicated to understand the science, and when it comes to loved ones, they knew them their whole life so some ppl just have a narcissistic side to it. And as for other's, it's because they're hard headed on top of all this. The only way to get them to understand is to understand exactly why they feel the way they do, and consider what they're saying and reach them from where they're at.

Isn't it loving to warn a person that what they are doing is going to lead to an awful outcome, or is it more loving to ignore a person even if it means letting them do something that leads to death or a miserable outcome? Christians do not hate people that are trans. In fact it is the opposite. Christians are desperately trying to warn people that they are heading down  a path of misery and destruction both physically and spiritually. There is perception that Christians are hating trans people, that much is clear, but generally in fact it quite the opposite. The people that really hate people that are trans are the media that place the idea in the mind of the public, the doctors that enable the exceptionally regretful and irreversible lifelong permanent \"transition\", the people that withhold mental health care that could prevent a person from undergoing a lifelong and potentially mentally devastating transition in the long term. Those people do not have any love for the \"trans\" person. It is absolutely mindboggling the numbers of suicides that trans people experience post transition. All of the transition in the world, top, bottom surgeries, etc... can not effectively address the mental black hole that is caused by gender dysphoria. Therapy and love, strong love, the type that really tries to reach the deficit in mind that is causing the pain in the first place is what is needed. But the idea that it is loving to just let people go down a path of moral, physical, and mental destruction is just mind bogglingly backwards from reality."

    "comment_body": "> Meanwhile progressive Christians will find you biblical texts that support the acceptance of trans people\n\nSo, I'm Lutheran, and just to prove a point, here's how one of the most famous \"anti-homosexual\" proverbs could be genuinely misconstrued.\n\nLeviticus 18:22\n> Hebrew (literal): ‚ÄúAnd with a male you shall not lay lyings of a woman.‚Äù  \nKing James: ‚ÄúThou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination.‚Äù  \nNew International: ‚ÄúDo not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.‚Äù  \nLiving Bible: ‚ÄúHomosexuality is absolutely forbidden, for it is an enormous sin.‚Äù\n\nThat's... some leap from the Living Bible. \"Homosexuality\" is certainly one reading -- one which the Living Bible is *more* than happy to place there -- but it's not the intended reading, I don't think. The New International version is certainly more correct to the original translation (as is the New International Version's intention.)\n\nTwo things stick out to me. One, Leviticus *is basically ignored in modern days anyways.* This is the book that defines how people should behave, and features quite a lot of \"laws\" that you'll find a hard time having any Christian follow to-the-letter. Like not wearing mixed clothing, not to mix crop fields, don't show favoritism, don't slander, don't eat meat that has blood in it, don't wear tattoos, respect the elderly, and don't withhold wages of people you hire, don't eat imported fruit unless it's exactly 5 years old, if you cheat on someone you should sacrifice a ram in front of a priest's house, etc. Basically all of those get ignored by a lot of Christians. Eating a hamburger cooked anything less than well-done is a sin, but you don't see anyone talk about that, eh? Love me a good medium to medium-rare burger.\n\nTwo, and probably more important; Women back then were treated as less than men. Taking into account, if we use the first instance of man to mean \"equal\" and the instance of woman to mean \"lesser\", \"Dot not lie with an equal as one lies with a lesser\" is a much clearer law, which doesn't rely on using \"lie\" to mean \"sex\", but rather any kind of mistreatment -- including *literally* lying. You shouldn't mistreat someone you are equal in social status to. That's more inline with the rest of the bible's teachings anyways, and is along the lines of loving thy neighbor, which *is* the second-most-important law, above all others."

Attacking, shaming, contradicting... all while believing they're a good person degrading someone who has shown them nothing but kindness."

In other words if you are a trans female, then act or BE the female gender you are, don't come off as a male that wants to appear female, that's kind of creepy and it will definitely be taken that way. If you are genuinely a female (male transitioning to a female) then you need to live in that gender, and not just try to act like a female, be the female you are.\nIt's ridiculous how trans females are rejected so strongly, but trans males are overlooked almost as normal, why is that when the numbers show that there are as many trans men as there are trans women ?"

Note at the time Eunichs included people described as natural-born eunichs - people we would today possibly describe as gay men or trans individuals, but their understanding was redically different at the time.\n\nThere's a well referenced summary [here](https://people.well.com/user/aquarius/rome.htm)"

My original comment was in reference to United States history since the European settlement started and displaced the indigenous population just to clarify. It was not a historic analysis or in-depth chronology of all belief systems and how they have been used by the powerful to suppress or displace the weak outside their sphere of influence. Most belief systems seem to have compassionate core principles. That means little to some people as history has proven. Us against them becomes the prime mover. I‚Äôm personally not religious, not for many years anyway. I do see religion and beliefs being manipulated by conservatives in the USA against our community at the moment. I do not speak about other countries even though much of the same likely applies, just replace ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù and insert the dominant local religion."

It means that He would deliberately make it so that some people cannot enjoy a loving relationship with another person in the same way that most people are permitted to, deliberately make it so that some people just have to suffer their entire lives for no reason while everyone else gets to be happy. It's not like it's a karma/past-life thing, either; these are fresh, new souls, given a much worse time in life for no justfiable reason. That's just arbitrary cruelty, and any divinity that engages in that is not worth worshipping.\n\nIf you are in the latter camp, as many who speak as you do are, then your efforts will never bear fruit - because I find meaning, even morality, in defying you. In being happy in spite of a supposed all-powerful God who gave me a life sentence of misery."

If we're referring to the same comment, Jesus \"fed the poor, told people to pay their taxes, \\[and not to\\] to hoard wealth.\" Of course he didn't subscribe to any modern socio-economic system. Criticising that takes the fun out of imagining that he would likely be called a woke socialist today, which makes sense to me. Now, if someone is putting Jesus' face on a Socialist Party poster or something, taking it literally and using him in that way, I would not support that and think that would be fair game for criticism. Anyway, you and I are probably generally on the same page. I agree with you that \"His preaching the need to repent lest you be sent to a pit of fire is unacceptable...\" In my opinion, that's one of the main disqualifying attitudes/rules of most organized religions - we are right and you must believe and do as we do or you'll die. In my estimation, all religions have good things to teach because there are many universally good ideas that humans have learned since our brains developed consciousness and an ability to make choices (the concept of destiny aside). It's when one person and then their followers claim they've got the ONLY correct interpretation of universal truths that belong to everyone that the claims becomes obviously false and misused.

And, despite someone's political leanings, they don't *hate* anyone; they simply don't get to see the adverse effects of whatever policies they support. Yeah, it can be uncomfortable - both for us and them. But, the way I see it, I'm probably the only trans person they know. So, I could be the *only* opportunity to show some people that we're totally normal people who aren't whatever we've been reduced to in their mind. In my experience, going around calling people names and drawing irreconcilable lines in the sand just doesn't help. I've had several people reach out and tell me that I've given them a positive perspective of who trans people are and helped tear down boundaries. Maybe I haven't *changed* their political leanings, but at least I've humanized trans people in their minds so to the degree that, maybe the next trans person doesn't get the downstream brunt of whatever bigotry that person might have. I know it's a tough mindset to have for a lot of people - particularly those who have experienced trauma. And, of course everyone deserves boundaries.

It‚Äôs possible that she has a Trump sign because she has to for her husband, but the greater likelihood is that she has it because she supports him.

But that being said, it is your family member, it‚Äôs up to you. I think it‚Äôs fine to tell her why you were uncomfortable, but if you tell her, tell her because it‚Äôs something that you want to express. Don‚Äôt tell her because you expect her to act a particular sort of way after you tell her. Because odds are that she is a Trump supporter and that she is going to say that she doesn‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre uncomfortable with it, or she could start going into transphobic rants that she‚Äôs been brainwashed into."

My ex gf tried to rat me out when I broke up with her and my dad told me and all he said was just \"as long as it's what you want, I just don't want you to look like that guy from Kardashians\". Recently, I've seen a lot of young kids vote the same as their parents out of ignorance (who's parents are republican and they always vote the same regardless of who it is). But there are also a lot of ignorant and desperate people out there willing to listen to liars to put out fires they started...with gasoline...\n\nBut just like any other ignorant white supremacists who always blame foreigners, tRump and Hitler had the same game plan... Blame someone else for your problems. Since dumb people prefer hatred and violence over logic and elaborate analysis and planning... Well you get new age tRump supporters. My father despite his jokes about trans with my brother, despises that my younger brother voted for him... But I mean trans jokes only breed trans hatred...\n\nRegardless in your case OP, you can tell to her and ask why they voted how they did. But don't give an opinion. I'd find out if it was for the BS economic side of it (all of which is total BS and will definitely make things worse) or the hatred side of it... You might be surprised to know she like most of his supporters had no clue about trans rights being attacked and corporate take overs he sponsors... Like I said some people are just dumb and have faith in people who lie. If she knew tough... That's a whole other story... My bi friend voted for him but he only did due to his military father who's a rep.... When I told him about trans rights he didn't believe me til others confimed it... He stood silent...\n\nSo maybe ur sister and her guy don't know all the facts and just didn't like the rushed dems candidate... Which is the case of many.\n\nTry being neutral and maybe occasionally breaking misconceptions with a check list of links confirming what you say is true... Like trans rights being taken down.. Have links ready and don't push anything, just \"discover it with her\".. Be like \"oh I heard he's targeting trans rights, what did you hear?\"... Then follow up with \"hmm, well let's see if we can find anything\"... Against political cults it can work, but it takes many sessions... Over religious people... Well it's all up to them, you have little control. So there is still some hope. Good luck."

There is no easy way for you to preserve the peace until you know their true feelings about you and your transgender status. They seemed to keep it all under control during your visit, and you seemed to do the same, too. It is tough being a good diplomat. I feel the weight and importance of being a good diplomat, too. I am a older transgender woman and I take my show on the road daily. Being a positive role model is important to me. I feel that how we behave, how we present, how we carry ourselves, how we deal with insults and idiots, is important in helping to change perspectives about the transgender community, even if it only one or two folks here and there. And while there are times for that confrontational thing, too, when I read that story my feelings leaned more towards taking a more peaceful approach in the home of sis and her family. I can understand the discomfort and anxiety of it all, a kind of stranger in a strange land thing, especially with that flag present, but it was their home and you had to abide by the customs and standards of that household while you were there. But like another respondent mentioned, a meal with sis out in town, in a neutral place, might be in order just to set the record straight. By treating her with respect hopefully that respect will come back to you. But changing political mindsets in that house? It might be impossible. Loss of one kind or another seems inevitable as a transgender person. With that heart to heart, one must be ready to possibly lose some family, maybe for awhile, possibly for life. Love, Cat"

I'm gay or B. I'm nonbinary. The only thing that gives them any hint is that I have long hair and do my makeup (but that's not even tied to gender, so they can also erase that).\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that, if I do get to a point in my transition where I'm feeling comfortable, I worry that nice moments like these probably won't happen anymore due to who I am and her views (of me and in general)."

Science has actively proven it to not be the case and that human biology is very unstable and not exactly written in stone. \n\nFor example, estrogen and testosterone function the same in people no matter their chromosomes. If you want boobs take estrogen. If you want a beard take testosterone.\n\nWithout even going into detail of what estrogen does to amab genitalia and how it effectively makes it useless unless effort is put into keeping it functional, or how muscle mass is proven to be lost over time making trans women weaker. \n\nThe main difference is in a single marker that completely fails sometimes, othertimes it functions. Your entire understanding of \"basic biology\" comes down to one thing that barely even works and trans people are a part of the example of it completely failing. \n\nMy career is as a historian, and I will say there are records of trans people further back than people like to admit. \n\n\nAs for all your other comments on stuff like living in a democracy so people cannot oppose who the people elected. Donald trump successfully brainwashed the american people with a slogan from the reagan era and dictator like grand stand moves to appear strong. He has now created an oligarchy in waiting by his appointments and even intends to leave the world health organisation. He is objectively a bad leader, you cannot think he was good without fundamentally misunderstanding geopolitics and economics. \n\nSo to conclude, grow up. You are treating people scared for their lives by a movement that openly praises murderers of trans people and attempts to turn them into a scape goat like their fear is irrational. Do you treat all people you know like this? Would you say this stuff to someones face? No, the anonymity of the internet is what gives you the willingness to prove why if there is a god heaven is not the place you will be going."

How would such effort impact people whose legal gender was changed by their state government?  Where does the 10th Amendment come into play in all of this?  And what about males with prostate cancer who would normally be prescribed a form of estrogen?\n\nAnd where is this priority in the scale of Trump's lunacy?  He has gotten people to care about trans in sports, GAC for minors, etc.  But is there sufficient love available to him if he enters into the battle of personal adult medical care?

It's important for transgender people to be aware of current political events and support organizations that are promoting human rights.\n\nWhile the US presidential election is over, there will be congressional elections in New York and Florida in 2025.  Although I live in the northern midwest, I plan to educate myself about the candidates.  If there are candidates who support human rights (including women and lgbt), along with fair labor, environment, social security, and standing with our NATO allies, I plan to volunteer to phone bank and/or write postcards to likely voters.   While the Democrats probably won't win, it's important to make a good faith effort.  Anything can happen.\n\nDuring a previous election, I volunteered through the Human Rights Campaign (hrc.org) to help the Georgia senate candidates, Ossoff and Warnock, and they both won.  While I didn't expect them to win in Georgia, it shows that a good faith effort can make a difference.   If a progressive or moderate Democrat wins in New York or Florida, it will send a message to Trump world that they need to moderate their policies."

Any threat to off label being legally acceptable is a threat to huge profits from other drugs though).  They have a very strong lobbying arm and I'd expect them to fight hard against any restrictions on the practice.\n\nEven opening the door to it with a targeted ban on off label hormones is going to make them nervous, since it probably makes a future introduction of restrictions on other medications easier to justify."

But Republican Congress is a mess, and they've gotten few things passed with a bigger majority. \n\nThey would have to have the self-discipline and work in unison, which is not likely when a lot of them don't even show up. A Republican straight up went missing, cast zero votes, and they didn't even notice for 6 months until they found out she was checked into a retirement home for dementia.\n\nTrump's appointee, RFK Jr., could potentially schedule estradiol as the FDA cabinet member, but that will not only affect trans women, it will affect cis women. And that's a good chunk of his voter base. \n\nBut I don't think that would be his main focus. His personal desire would probably be to repeal vaccination mandates first and enforce health codes in schools to ensure healthy eating."

Some of his assertions may prove false with the new administration, hard to say. It also may only apply in more blue states than red...\n\n>>>\nIt is really terrible what the president elect and his allies have said about gender diverse people, I am so sorry that discrimination like this exists and I hope there is an end to it as soon as possible.\n\nIn terms of your individual healthcare as an adult in the state of Michigan, thankfully it is unlikely that your care will be affected. I can't say the same for folks under 18 or adults using Medicaid in other states. But not even the most extreme states have passed a law banning gender affirming care for adults. It is conceivable but unlikely that government funding (Medicare and Medicaid) for gender affirming care could be restricted nationally, which would have an impact on folks carrying those insurances but not folks using commercial insurance. In the unlikely event that folks on Medicaid and/or Medicare could not receive gender affirming care covered by insurance, paying for care without insurance would still be an option and we would work diligently to try to cover those costs via assistance programs through local and national LGBTQ resource centers and through [local hospital group] itself as well as utilizing other strategies to limit costs to you. Of note, it is not legal for a healthcare provider to prescribe more medication than someone is taking such that a stockpile can be built.\n\nEven though there are people out there full of hate, know that you are loved and valuable. You are worth getting the care that you need including mental health care. I would encourage you to seek out positive support for yourself and to be a positive force for others. There are trans support groups/meet-ups in our area and Transgender Michigan has a help line if you ever need to talk to someone 855-345-8464.\n\n>>>"

As long as the liquid is clear and you employ proper injection safety, you should generally be good.\n\nAnd while I wouldn't ordinarily recommend stockpiling, there is a vested interest in banning gender-affirming care.

I don't know why but it seems like you thought I said \"trans women look like men\" even though I didn't. might be because of the language barrier? \n\nmy point was about passing. since you look like a woman, there's no problem with you going to the women's bathroom. I think that's where you belong. would be weird and maybe unsafe if you went to the men's. \n\nno, I didn't think that some people are trying to start an altercation. which is why I said \"we don't know that you're not trying to harm us.\"\n\nI completely disagree with your last point. someone who looks like the rock absolutely shouldn't go to the women's restroom. that's extremely scary. \n\nbasically all I said was \"please look like a woman if you enter a women's space since because of the male violence almost every woman has experienced at least once it's scary to see someone looking like man in an intimate space even though they're a trans woman - since we can't tell and therefore don't know that they're just trying to to their business and nothing nefarious.\"\n I don't know why that's so controversial.\n\n\noh and again, I'm very sorry for what happened to you. are you okay?"

You can walk into the same shop two days in a row and get \"ma'am\" one day and \"sir\" the next by the same person. There is no \"you look completely like a man/woman\" when you're in the process of transitioning.            \n\nFurthermore, if those people are uncomfortable, that's *their* issue and they don't get to harass someone else over it. \n\n>basically all I said was \"please look like a woman if you enter a women's space since because of the male violence almost every woman has experienced at least once it's scary to see someone looking like man in an intimate space even though they're a trans woman - since we can't tell and therefore don't know that they're just trying to to their business and nothing nefarious.\"\n I don't know why that's so controversial.\n\nBecause the *trans women* are also women who have experienced male violence at least once, and it's scary *for them* to have to go into a male space when they are women. Can you imagine being told \"Hey, you don't look enough like a woman. Go in with the men.\"? You are putting *your comfort* over *their safety.* That's not just controversial, it's downright shitty.         \n\nYou really can't tell if someone is just minding their own business or if they're being creepy? What about men, actual men, who have medical issues and might need to use the closest bathroom which just happens to be the men's? What about fathers who need to change their baby's diaper and the men's room *still* in 2024 doesn't have a changing table? What about a father who has a six year old daughter, should he bring her into the men's room with the urinals? There are so many reasons a person who is an actual man might go into the women's room for valid reasons.          \n\nIf a trans woman among all things in the women's room makes you so uncomfortable you can't stand it and think it justifies her being harassed..... use single occupancy toilets.

But you have to acknowladge some trans people do not pass as either gender. And many trans people look like trans people, a minority group that faces discrimination.\n\n>please look like a woman\n\nNot an objective thing and sometimes not achievable. Many famous cis women are accused of being trans (by transphobes mostly).\n\n>WE DO NOT KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT IN DANGER.\n\nRegardless of your feelings of safety. Statistically you are safe in your bathroom with trans individuals. But sex restrictive bathrooms are actually dangerous for trans individuals.\n\nI am telling you this as a still going to mens bathroom bc I am not out in my university but I get a lot of weird looks from strangers but my friends know me as a man so I cant just switch my clothing and bathroom trans woman."

    "comment_body": ">I feel like I hear jokes like, ‚Äúit would be so sick to have a pair of boobs,‚Äù a lot\n\nYeah but the context of the joke is the key. They aren't usually saying this as some kind of personal insight into their fluid understanding of gender or for self actualization. They are saying this because they view breasts as inherently sexual objects, and the joke implies having breasts would be access to something that turns them on at a whim.\n\n>¬†that most people don‚Äôt fully like the person that they are.\n\nI think some of the biggest failings in trans discussion, is that run into language that implies a lot of our struggles are unique to us. But a good chunk of our experiences... are ordinary human experiences. Cis people also feel dysphoria too. They struggle with their gender not because they do not want to \"be\" but because gender roles are restricting and punishing for EVERYONE who doesn't fall under the ideal. A lot of people do not like who they are, because our societies thrives on degrading confidence.\n\n* Have you seen the way cis men talk about their lack of facial hair? The pride they express when they even get just a little bit of stubble?\n* We have an entire stereotype and pathology labeled for short men, because their lack of height directly affects how their manhood is perceived. Even trans women here regularly express disinterest in dating short men, because height is so gendered.\n* On the flipside: Have you ever seen the movie \"She's The Man?\" Where Amanda Bynes cross-dresses as a boy so she can play soccer? A particularly notable story from the filming is that Amanda needed lots of therapy, because being a boy for even just briefly completely hurt her self esteem as a woman.\n\nThis isn't to say that cis struggles are equal to ours, cause they are not. Our society was made for cis people afterall. But identity IS a struggle for everyone, especially when gender is involved."

    "comment_body": "The common wisdom around here is that no, men don't actually want to be women.\n\nBut, you're hearing all this \"wouldn't it be sick to have boobs\" stuff. Fair. So what does that mean?\n\nWell, here's the thing about \"would it be cool if\" statements. They are generally about things that aren't actually possible or practical. \"Wouldn't it be cool if we had wings so we could just fly everywhere?\" \"Wouldn't it be cool if robots did all the work and we could just spend our days doing whatever we wanted?\" yadda yadda. And, yeah, maybe that would be cool! But it's not possible or practical or realistic in the world we live in today.\n\nAnd that's the mental stance that I suspect cis men have towards having boobs or whatever other things you're hearing. They don't think of it as something that's actually realistic or possible or practical. It's just some hypothetical fantasy, where they're focusing on *one* very narrow aspect of the thing in question--that is, *why* it would be cool--and ignoring everything else.\n\nSo it could well be that these guys really love some nice tiddies. So fun to squeeze! And that's what they're focusing on. \"If I had my own tiddies, I could squeeze them whenever I wanted!\" Which, yeah. Fair. You absolutely could, bro!\n\nBut again, that's an *incomplete* picture of the whole situation. Because, bro, you actually *can* get yourself some tiddies, and here's what it takes: Go on hormone replacement therapy and wait a good couple of years for them to really grow in, assuming they actually do grow as much as you want, which is not guaranteed at all. So then maybe also get breast augmentation surgery to puff 'em up to whatever gets you all excited. Oh, except--did I forget to mention?--HRT is going to make you completely impotent at the same time. True, you could go off of HRT after growing your boobs and wait for your T to rebound, but in the meantime you're going to be spending a couple of years basically unable to get hard and stay hard like you like. And the HRT itself involves taking a *lot* of pills and probably learning to give yourself injections too, because that gives you better estrogen ratios for feminization. Oh, yeah, and you might also get curvy, feminine hips and a nice thicc butt along the way.\n\nNow ask yourself this: when you put it *that* way, when you lay out the whole picture, do you still think that these guys would think it's cool to have boobs? Given what it actually takes to get them, and what else happens to you at the same time?\n\nI have a much harder time imagining that they would think the whole package is still as cool as the narrow aspect they were focusing on when they said it would be cool to have boobs in the first place.\n\nAnyway. That's my suspicion. They may think that having certain female attributes is \"sick\" or whatever, but only from a very narrow, unrealistic perspective. It's not a *real* wish. It's just a sort of hypothetical fantasy wish."

They aren't really thinking deeply about what that experience would be like. It's basically just something super basic like \"Cool, I would get to play with boobs for a day\". It's all a fun joke to them because they don't ever actually think about being a woman.\n\nAlso, you're conflating gender identity and gender expression in some of your replies and they simply aren't the same thing. Are masculine women, who know they are women, actually men just because they enjoy looking/acting more masc? Are feminine men, who know they are men, actually women because they enjoy looking/acting more fem? What about femboys? There are plenty of femboys that love looking and/or acting hyper-feminine that are also confident that they're men. The fact that you have friends that are cool with presenting masc/fem is part of their gender expression. You would need to get more specific and really talk to them about actually being the opposite gender (or neither!) if you wanted to get their true feelings on their gender identities."

And even when the media mislabeled it, subtext tends to slip past the censors. There was some early 2000's millenial TV show that showed a guy in the girls bathroom acting like one of them and I'm stunned the internet didn't label him as a trans girl, too many unaware straight people running that?\n\nThat and some of it is probably a weird sense of guys trying to own womens bodies (again). Or just wanting to touch boobs on demand.\n\nCis men and women DO know what being gender affirmed is. Got tons of them as colleagues. If anything the guys envy women who feel safe with emotions, since they're told not to, who show behavior that's \"out of the box\" in the patriarchy in general (cause it also limits them). It's a trait they wish they could feel safe with. We all got reputations, I seek out pink they avoid it LOL. I spent so much work branding environmentalism as a masculine provider quality after big oil labeled it as too feminine for the guys, yes, they are highly insecure about their genders but many are indeed cis. Even for me it's about being the strongest woman I can be, not anything else, the only difference is it took being trans to pull that off."

I asked them about gender expression, mainly, and I was just wondering if it was a clean-cut no or if there was actually some gray area that I didn‚Äôt understand."

That's generally our first taste of experience \"truth\" outside of what we've been given.   \n  \nSome old friends of mine can easily be described as the traditional ideal concept of \"manly.\" But they were wearing the same androgynous and feminine emo/scene fashions as me in grade school. Just because I turned out trans, doesn't mean our shared exploration was a \"sign\" for them too. We were all just testing the waters to see what was possible.\n\nand I think the biggest problem with assuming cis people can't be sure in their cishood, it also means our confidence as trans people is also in question.

Kinda wish I knew sooner. But poorly trained medical practitioners, insurance and haters, make it much harder than it should be.\n\nAnyway, when I was full guy brain, I loved being a guy. No bras, no boob punch pain. But I've always been pretty empathetic towards other species, races, age groups, sexes etc. Nobody really ever thinks in detail about how they'd change... They may have depression and WANT to change... But none really get into details outside of looks. N it's usually temporary in cis genders.. Unless they have subliminal photoshopped glamor models and filters they compare to, I'd see women wanting to change a lot about themselves.. But men tend to spend money on physical objects and only think they change is strength muscle... Women look at cosmetics and surgeries, maybe being tone.\n\nTrans are the ones who take it all a step further with hormones, surgery, voice therapy and wearing waist trainers etc etc.\n\nHaha. Well the first time I heard of ranma I was scared of watching it... I thought it was about a trans person and it made me uneasy and I didn't know why.. Perhaps because of the taboo nature.. Or my father and brother who seemed to mask their insecurities with hatred of trans people.\n\nPov's are interesting topics to explore."

I don't really like conforming to social gender stereotypes. I didn't escape one box to be stuffed into another one. \n\nYes, the other box definitely isn't as uncomfortable as the one I used to be pushed into, but I won't let people stuff me in. If parts of me don't fit into the box, that is perfectly all right, and I will resist any attempt to try and get me to conform to what people expect.

Then they feel like they just can‚Äôt win and they start to resent being forced to even try.\n\nI think the most important thing is that people show grace to one another where possible! I feel similarly to what you said about showing people it‚Äôs okay to slip up. Most, if not all, humans have slipped up in conversation, and it can be mortifying, especially if you hurt someone without intending to. \n\nI‚Äôm a non-passing trans man early in transition, and I‚Äôve had friends misgender me by accident and then their eyes go wide, almost with fear, as they stutter and apologize and wait for my reaction. And now that I‚Äôve been on T for 6 months or so, I once in awhile get someone who accidentally genders me correctly (I still go by my old name and pronouns outside of my personal life), and they get the same mortified look. So I know people feel like they‚Äôre walking on eggshells because they aren‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôll react, or in the case of strangers, have no idea what my gender is supposed to be.\n\nI just tell myself that the best thing I can do is to bring my best, most gracious and authentic self to every interaction. I think it‚Äôs well-established that people often begin to care about a movement when they actually know someone in that movement (like people who suddenly become pro-gay rights when their nephew comes out, etc).\n\nI certainly do NOT think that every trans person is responsible for trying to open someone‚Äôs mind (we‚Äôre all just people with our own lives and concerns, like everyone else).\n\nFor me, though, the only way that I‚Äôve been able to assuage my own doubts and fears, enough to stay the course of my transition, is to see every day as an opportunity to show how much light and life I can bring to the people I meet, when I‚Äôm able to be myself in public, even as a non-passing trans man. \n\nOver the years I‚Äôve seen so many people, who were formerly shy or depressed or sullen, blossom into people bursting with light and love to share with the world. I‚Äôve always said that it would take a very callous person indeed to witness such a beautiful transformation and still condemn it.\n\nIt‚Äôs my ardent prayer that each of us can continue to stand tall in the face of adversity, and that the people around us will have no choice but to witness just how much more we have to offer when we can bring our most authentic selves to the table.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long-winded reply! I wish you, and anyone else reading this, a happy new year filled with an abundance of safety, satisfaction, and much joy!"

Poor meaning, it has value but because it is very flawed, it‚Äôs not the best argument.\n\n‚ÄúTalking about arguments like we‚Äôre in court‚Äù\n\nThis is just purely anti-intellectual. I‚Äôm not a lawyer and I‚Äôm not fluent in lawyer speak. The fact is we don‚Äôt know. End of story. And you failed to prove that we do. The guy made a blanket statement incorrectly referencing all men. Not only that but seeing this in ‚Äúmedia and stuff‚Äù isn‚Äôt clear. Like if he said what he meant was he saw it gaining traction on social media and the news then it‚Äôs clear but I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúand stuff‚Äù is. That‚Äôs like when people say ‚Äúremember that thing we did yesterday?‚Äù Uhhh what ‚Äúthing‚Äù!? ‚ÄúThing‚Äù isn‚Äôt something I can go off of.\n\n‚ÄúYour intensity‚Äù\n\nI typed this on a gantry above traffic going 75+ mph waiting for lasers to be configured. All of my ‚Äúintensity‚Äù was focused on my fear of heights. Yet you somehow discerned ‚Äúintensity‚Äù from what I said. A simple disagreement and me laying out my thoughts as to why I disagree. That‚Äôs ‚Äúintense‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt seem very nice to me‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a disagreement. It‚Äôs not mean or nice. It‚Äôs neutral. I‚Äôm trying to challenge their statement because I believe it‚Äôs wrong. That‚Äôs all. If that‚Äôs mean then you need to grow a spine.\n\nPeople like you are what‚Äôs wrong with left leaning spaces. If you can‚Äôt defend what you say, why the fuck are you saying anything? Even if the defense is flawed, it would at least show thought process behind what you said. But everyone is so conflict-avoidant. \n\nThe funny thing is the guy made a much better, simpler, and concise point when he replied to me and I said that‚Äôs a better point. I actually acknowledged it and somehow I‚Äôm an asshole. Yeah. Okay."

Only the people who are pan and/or bi don't really have much transition pressure and usually live as the gender they are born with because the difficulty of transition doesn't give them any benefit.\" -TheUnreal0815\n\nSo you tell me how sexual orientation and gender orientation is the same, also please point out how them saying \"sexual orientation\" means \"gender orientation\". Yes they said \"not so different.\", but that also means when they state \"Only the people who are pan and/or bi don't really have much transition pressure and usually live as the gender they are born with....\" that seems to me they are saying someone who's sexual orientation is bi, they have no reason to transition from their born gender because they are comfortable with the gender they identify as. So I'll say it agian I'm a transwomen who is bisexual, the gender I was born as I don't want to be nor was comfortable as.\n\n Also let's look at what pansexual means- \"sexually or romantically attracted to people regardless of their sex or gender\" -off of Google\n\n Now let's check bisexual - \"sexually or romantically attracted to both men and women, or to more than one sex or gender\"-also off of Google\n\n*gasps in shock* Now let's check to see the difference in definition for gender orientation-\"Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender.[1] Gender identity can correlate with a person's assigned sex or can differ from it.\" -Wikipedia (i know not the best source since it can be freely edited.) \n\nSo it's safe to say there is no allegory or non allegory here for that to be, they would have to be doing a direct comparison between sexual orientation and gender orientation or in this sense a bi/pan trans person and a non binary trans person and they don't. Definition on an allegory -\"a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one.\" And for non allegory it's taken at face value which could not give any alternate or figurative meaning to.\" -both off Google."

You should hop in a time machine, go back a decade, and transition the way *they* want you to. Sarcasm for the lols.\n\nFlip this claim around; your 'friend' is being transphobic by only valuing a certain type or subset of types among transfolks. They've also insinuated that you give the transcommunity a bad reputation by public association, also suggesting they're afraid of associating with you, and how that might affect their own reputation.\n\nAlternative identites of all types are a great way to weed-out reactionary, ideologicaly conflicted, and pointlessly judgemental people. Sometimes these folks can be talked to or walked-through what they assumed wrong, identify how those assumptions are inaccurate and harmful, and honestly aim to be less presumptive, but much of the time, that effort isn't worthwhile.

As he put it: there's a national election in a few days, so the dictator running the country will probably cut the power here and there so everyone remembers who's in charge. That's just a part of his life and despite the fact it's absolute bullshit, he's one of the happiest people I know.\n\nThat mirrors what I've discussed with my therapist: this election has been a lesson in the fact that I have extremely little ability to shape world events. It doesn't matter how justified my beliefs and morals may be. I can vote in elections, throw a little money at worthwhile candidates, and that's about it.\n\nThat's difficult to swallow, but it also helps trade high-minded idealism for realism. I live in Boston which is one of the safest places in the world a trans person can live, even considering the changing state of national politics. My passport is up to date and I'm gainfully employed. I've learned I don't need to live in existential dread as long as I focus on what's actionable. If there's something I *can* do, then I do it. If there's nothing I can do, then that's that. I need to stay mindful that things can always get worse but I don't need to spend energy debating whether or not they will. If they do, I'll reassess.\n\nMeanwhile, letting go of I can't affect lets me better focus on things I can. My performance at work is markedly improved since the election and starting these conversations in therapy. I'm going to the gym more. I had a lovely Christmas with my wife. We're taking in a trans family member in a few months to help them escape from a bad situation.\n\nIf anyone's interested in this topic, here's more on [Stoicism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSvKNNtkUSU) from Abigail Thorn, a trans woman and creator of Philosophy Tube."

Yes, society was essentially ignoring average trans people back then, it's true that we weren't the target du jour, but being or being mistaken for gender nonconforming was always an efficient way to attract trouble.\n\nI risked a lot to move somewhere I'm slightly safer and can participate in more mutual aid. I look at how the percentage of young people identifying under every banner keeps rising, and so does family support despite public opinion. I've had expectations placed on my generation to fix things, and it's not that I expect younger folks to single-handedly save us; I just think it's a good indication that they cannot recork this bottle. Cis queers can't always be trusted to have our backs, but many are noticing the tide turn toward them, and together we're a significant group. They can't hold us down forever. They barely managed a decade in Germany, and Dora Richter *lived*.\n\nI am scared, though. Like, I'm keeping an ovary, for a start. I'm trying to be practical and focus on completing practical tasks which can't be taken away, whether in transition or in my life in general, but I'm also falling into escapism patterns. I want to help others more, now, but I'm trying to figure out how to best help without burning myself out. Helping others is traditionally very effective at staving off existential dread, but I know so many of us can barely do for ourselves."

Pro-trans activists and advocates in the UK - the epicenter of the anti-trans movement - regularly overwhelm the anti-trans demonstrations in sheer numbers. *Even with the support of most political parties and just about every broadcast and print news outlet and funding from American big business fundamentalist Christian organizations, the average person in the UK still doesn't care that much*. The gender critical movement is a far-right hate cult and the people involved are very toxic and unpleasant. Meanwhile, most trans people just want to mind our own business and live our lives. We only really get upset at transphobia against us, but we don't go picking fights. Most people seem to favor people with chill and transphobes have no chill.

I found that taking action was a better solution to facing that sense of foreboding than sitting around wringing my hands worrying about it. We have a lot of work to do in preparation for the eventualities to come, but we can also act on our behalf in small ways to lessen that sense of dread. For instance, I have been spending the past couple months shoring up my local alliances. I looked around and have decided, after a long season of pursuing work elsewhere, that I am good where I am at, that my part of the West Coast, a somewhat blue slice of the country, is filled with resources, friends and allies that should hopefully be there for me, in whatever capacity, when things get rough. On a more personal level, I took it upon myself to prepare myself for flight and/or harassment or even possible arrest by preparing my documents so that they all read the same. Working with people, such as my physicians or work management, people who control my medicines and cash flow, has helped them see that the services and transactional relationships we share, might take on new meaning, so to be ready. A crisis is only as good as the fear behind it.  I can't get worried right now, they are holding their cards too close to their chest and haven't shown them yet. Love, Cat"

I live in a city and state where my rights are protected. I'm white. I'm college educated. I still have all of that as a trans woman. My family accepts me. I didn't really lose many people when I came out. While dysphoria still hurts, I think I more or less pass in society--or if I don't, at least people are still polite to me. \n\nIt breaks my heart that so many trans people are struggling. Whether it's because of laws that are targeting trans people (trans kids especially) or because of discrimination, I absolutely hate it. But I have been largely shielded from it in my own life. I've had to fight for my medical coverage, but as we've all learned recently, a lot of people deal with that. I know that so many people are worse off.\n\nAnd I also know that there are a lot of other suffering people in the world. And many of them have none of the privileges I have. I've gained a lot of perspective being part of the Palestine solidarity movement. It's frustrating that there are people trying to keep me out of women's restrooms, but nobody is dropping 2,000 bombs on my city. So much could be so much worse. And showing solidarity to other oppressed people feels a lot better than being sad for myself.\n\nIt really helps a lot to see the bigger picture, and I'm sure that for you, it will feel better once you get through your transition and actually know what you can expect. I know that it's very hard being where you are, knowing that something bad might happen, but not exactly knowing how it's going to be. Good luck."

Which led to a lot of degenerative illnesses.\n\nSo, the answer is, the same way as someone who always has felt this would. I was different as a child. Society holds a cane or wheelchair differently. It's the same even if I'm going out with my he/him pins etc. It's crippling and scary. I was raised AFAB and I worry for my brothers and sisters I don't see every day in the community. But disabled people haven't stopped existing, and neither have intersexed, trans, gay, etc. folk. We go back to mythologies and long histories.\n\nSociety always tries to stamp us out. The thing is, I was raised by hard labor that broke me worse. And I know most people are just that in real life even in a scary city. I don't go out past dark much, and I do get scared. I don't fit most molds. Any really. But I still get scared.\n\nI have to smoke marijauana anyway for my genetic cocktail of illnesses to function, and the truth is what helps me combat it is when I do, I sit on my porch. I watch people and I talk to the birds. Everyone is just people. Sometimes people get angry.\n\nI've been around long enough to be here prior to when gay marriage was legal. It was scary back then too, but you were more anonymous. The truth is everyone has to find their own ways to cope with that fear. Bravery isn't about not being scared, it's being scared and doing it anyway. So I go out to the store in my chair with my hat and all my trans pins. I go out in my gothpunk fits. I wear spikes and don't go alone. Every little bit helps. I get misgendered but often it's not out of malice.\n\nOpinion is swaying. It just doesn't feel like it. I've seen it though. I grew up rural and theres always been a mind your own business vibe to that. Most people do, except the internet helped radicalized way too many too quickly. The best we can do is live our lives. The more of us who just exist, the more normal it is in general society. People think our population is small, but even one percent of millions is a large sample size. Large enough people can run businesses helping other queer people and trans folk with tucking and binders.\n\nWe've always been good at quietly networking. Think about friends of Dorothy and stonewall. Do some history research if you don't know. It really helps, I promise. Stay safe out there."

I know for certain that if a change happened in our country that negatively affects trans people (or anyone of marginalized groups), it would trigger protests everywhere. We may not need to worry about numbers anyway, as some other lgbt+ members would most likely protest too, including allies. We would not let anything bad happen.\n\nIf authorities don't care about minorities, the minority will make them HAVE to care, I'm sure that the authorities are aware of this too"

You start dealing with it day to day and eventually you don't really think about it anymore. \nI had to stop over consuming news articles and think peices on issues because they create so much anxiety in me. \nI will always worry, it's just about the level of it and whether or not I can function. \nNot to sound like an asshole but the only good thing that came out of covid for me personally was that everyone learned how I felt. The agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, the fragility of my life in the grand scheme of the cosmos. I have always had those issues as long as i could remember. They learned how disposable and mortal we all are. And my worst fear came true and I lived through it and now I'm okay. And now everyone is mostly on the same page so it made it easier to walk through the word as who I am. That was a bit off base of the point but I think it helps to put into perspective how I feel. \n\n\nAt the end of the day I can hide or I can be myself and if I'm going to have the same issues either way? \nI'm just going to be me. \n\nEdited for clarification"

As a trans guy who just got the opportunity to start hrt after waiting for 6 years I deal with it by like, going on a big hike, or drinking a large glass of water all at once, or just by letting myself cry it out.\n\nI think we've all tried our best. I walked around doing voter registration canvassing in the desert heat this summer and I don't even know how many staircases I scaled for that shit. And it didn't really work. But, I mean, I got up each day for six years straight waiting to even start medical transition, I think being transgender can be very tediously going in circles a lot before you get somewhere, and maybe that's what's happening to us right now on a larger scale. \n\nI think the scariest part though, and the worst case scenario for me, is that it might genuinely come down to choosing between my full ride to college or my ability to continue my transition for the next three years. But like, I've been thinking about this book I picked up a bit ago about the history of Einsteins equations, because one part mentions how one of his assistants ended up working with Einstein because he was searching for work after fleeing Nazi Germany. It gives me hope that some people figured out their lives after fleeing something as horrible as that. Theres also all of the accounts of queer people in the past who managed to transition and live out their lives despite the odds being stacked worse against them, less social awareness and less resources. If so many people in the past were able to figure things out, I have trust that we will too."

We're all on Reddit sure, but a massive number of people don't have easy access to community for all things gender related. Take deep red counties: after accounting for size (such counties tend to be smaller) and area (they are smaller primarily due to distance, emptiness, agriculture), it isn't that there aren't transgender people, but they have no safety net or inner circle of trust for such a thing. They don't get taught simple things surrounding gender that we all take for granted because of course we know these things. We every so often see \"then vs. now\" posts/photos and often something to the effect of \"then\" being or looking miserable compared to a much happier \"now\" is readily apparent, but this also implies that there are a lot of people stranded in that misery with no practical outlet or community.\n\nI say this why? To be an ass? Nope, and if I come off that way I do apologize. It is important as a reminder because some people are struggling in total isolation, and that's where so much of the increased suicide risk, comorbidity of other mental health issues, and even internalized phobia/self-hatred comes into play. Some people literally never have someone else tell them \"You're trans? That's okay with me\" their entire lives.\n\nAnyhoo, person above said \"a lot of us don't even know another transperson irl :(\" and it's worth repeating because, surprisingly, those of us who do have things like the various Reddit subs, or irl clubs, groups, meetups, etc, we are the lucky ones. And it's also easy to fall down the \"f you I got mine\" where we should, if safe (emphasis on: **if safe**), be more out there. We should be *making* those meetups, and clubs, and get-togethers. This is how we reach those people who really do not have that community and are trapped feeling miserable everyday. It is also how we fight the notion that we are insignificantly small a la OP's post, because we really aren't. 2.3 million+ people, in America alone, is not insignificant. Furthermore, a good number of people do believe human life is sacred, including communities like ours, and beyond that many potential allies are waiting to know more, and currently they just don't. The haters would love it if we just quietly lived out our lives and were less visible, and if the sheer pettiness in the face of that alone is enough to get someone to be more outspoken, that's a good a reason as any. But, building more community is not automatic: it takes effort and work to bridge people together, and those haters are absolutely banking on this to not happen."

Rather, in the past, we only had federal access to gender affirming care due to executive orders that *expanded* access by interpreting the ACA non-discrimination clauses to include gender identity. However, **the Supreme Court ruling on the Chevron deference has already removed the right to gender affirming care on a national level**. That doesn't mean access to gender affirming care is gone completely.\n\nThe way the US is set up, individual states have relatively strong rights/powers. Yes, the republicans have majority in all 3 federal branches. Yes, the checks and balances are now broken on a national level. However, there's a last check and balance - Federalism means that state rights are very strong compared to other historical empires. So much so, that the government is very good at doing nothing at all by design.\n\nIn order to ban gender affirming care, they'd have to go through one of two likely pathways:\n\n1. Withholding federal funds to financially pressure states to change their laws. This will likely get tied up in the courts.\n2. Pass a new federal law banning gender affirming care. In a typical political climate, this simply be impossible as a **super majority** is required to pass the law, due to the filibuster. However, it's possible a unified GOP could use the \"nuclear option\", to rush through a bill, as they did to appoint Supreme Court justices in the last Trump administration.\n\n**If gender affirming care is banned federally, it doesn't mean access would necessarily be cut off.** It's possible for a state like California to enact a sanctuary policy, ordering law enforcement and courts to refuse to enforce it - the same way such policies already exist to protect trans youth. However, it's possible many doctors may refuse to provide treatment due to fear of federal prosecution, and it's possible insurance policies will no longer cover treatment."

    "comment_body": "There seems to be a lot of confusion about trans healthcare. This question makes it seem as though there was NEVER ANY healthcare from the medical community prior to the most recent four years. Actually, there was trans healthcare even prior to Obama‚Äîthe ‚Äúgate‚Äù was primarily affordability. The difference was the difficulty in finding healthcare that was paid by private insurance. There had been no government mandates to assist making trans surgeries and hormones more affordable and accessible. Mostly, almost every private insurance plan (not all) considered gender affirming surgeries to be elective. The ones that helped pay for any surgeries were rather more selective in which surgeries they would pay for. \n\nTrans healthcare won‚Äôt simply disappear if/when Biden‚Äôs executive orders are reversed. But yes, there is cause for concern, especially for those of us planning surgeries since needed surgeries are so expensive, and if more insurance companies decide to exclude the coverage they have added, it will make affordability a major issue.\n\n‚Äî-from AI:\nThe statements you mentioned are partially true, but they need clarification. Former President Trump did express his intention to end transgender healthcare for minors, but there hasn‚Äôt been a recent executive order specifically targeting trans healthcare.¬π\n\nRegarding the congressional bill, it‚Äôs true that some lawmakers have proposed legislation that could impact trans healthcare. However, the outcome is uncertain, and it‚Äôs not clear if the bill will pass or how quickly it could be enacted.\n\nIf a bill were to pass, the implementation timeline would depend on the specific language and provisions. It‚Äôs possible that changes could take effect on a specific date, like January 1, 2026, or they might be phased in over time.\n\nRegarding your scheduled procedures, it‚Äôs essential to stay informed about any potential changes to trans healthcare policies. However, it‚Äôs also important to note that existing healthcare services and insurance coverage would likely continue until any new policies take effect.\n\nTo stay up-to-date on the latest developments, consider following reputable news sources and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations. You may also want to consult with your healthcare provider or insurance company to understand how any potential changes might impact your scheduled procedures.\n‚Äî-\nI expect WPATH and other allies will be very busy in the coming year(s)"

    "comment_body": "There are two things they've floated with regard to banning gender affirming care to various extents nationally (I believe the first is what's in the bill you linked), and the difference is _significant_.  One is that no government money can directly pay for it.  This excludes people on government healthcare from having it covered, but largely doesn't affect people on private insurance and anyone who can pay out of pocket can still do so.  As you point out this has been the case with abortion for some time, but Planned Parenthood (for example) received a lot of federal money for non-abortion services while still performing abortions under this broad setup.  Similarly emergency rooms nationally could provide abortions when medically necessary without risking the hospital's overall federal funding (some state laws, especially post-Dobbs have interfered with this obviously, but they're independent from the funding rules that have been around for far longer).  This option is very bad on the whole, and catastrophic for some people, but is still a ways off a national ban on gender affirming care.\n\nThe second option they've talked about is banning any facility that provides gender affirming care (from hormone or blocker prescriptions up to surgeries) from receiving any federal funding.  Basically no hospital or surgery center in the country is going to agree to forgo _all_ medicare and medicaid billing to allow gender affirming surgeries to be performed there, and similarly very few doctors are going to be willing to do that to write hormone prescriptions.  Depending on how it's implemented it could also mean that no retail pharmacies would be willing to fill prescriptions since they dispense tons of medication to people covered by government healthcare.\n\nThis winds up being a de facto ban on gender affirming care with loopholes for rich people.  In this situation the telemedicine places with internal mail order pharmacies could probably keep operating, but those are expensive and there are further actions the GOP could take to make them dramatically more so (e.g. require doctors (or full on endocrinologists) to write the prescriptions / meet with patients instead of NPs, which Florida was trying not long ago).  Similarly the \"pay a couple thousand dollars a year to ever walk in the door and we don't work with insurance at all\" concierge doctors could probably still write prescriptions, but most people can't come close to affording that."

This might affect access to:\n\n>* Healthcare services at religious hospitals or clinics\n\n>* Housing assistance through religious charities\n\n>* Employment services through faith-based organizations\n\n>* Educational opportunities at religious institutions\n\n>* Social services provided by religious organizations\n\n>The bill's restrictions on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs (Sections 533-534) could also have substantial effects. By prohibiting funding for these initiatives, the bill might limit:\n\n>* Workplace training about transgender inclusion\n\n>* Programs designed to prevent discrimination\n\n>* Resources for supporting transgender federal employees\n\n>* Guidelines for inclusive practices in federally-funded programs\n\n>* Educational materials about gender identity\n\n>Section 536's prohibition on teaching about discrimination based on sex could affect training and education about transgender rights and experiences. This might impact:\n\n>* Healthcare provider education about transgender healthcare needs\n\n>* Workplace training about gender identity discrimination\n\n>* Educational programs about gender diversity\n\n>* Professional development for federal employees about inclusive practices\n\n>The bill's broader impact on healthcare access and civil rights protections is more subtle but potentially far-reaching. By limiting federal agencies' ability to implement equity initiatives, it could affect:\n\n>* Development of transgender-inclusive healthcare policies\n\n>* Enforcement of non-discrimination protections\n\n>* Collection of data about transgender health disparities\n\n>* Research into transgender healthcare needs\n\n>* Implementation of inclusive workplace policies\n\n>Furthermore, the provision protecting religious beliefs about marriage could create a framework where organizations can more easily deny recognition of transgender individuals' gender identity while still receiving federal support. This could affect:\n\n>* Name and gender marker recognition\n\n>* Access to gender-appropriate facilities\n\n>* Coverage of transition-related healthcare\n\n>* Recognition of marriages involving transgender spouses\n\n>It's important to understand that these effects would primarily operate through indirect mechanisms - by shaping how federal funds can be used and what kinds of programs can be supported - rather than through direct restrictions on transgender rights. The impact would likely be felt most strongly in situations where federal funding intersects with religious organizations' services or where federal agencies' ability to implement inclusive policies is constrained by the bill's restrictions on diversity and equity initiatives.\n\nSkimmed the actual text and it seems to fit. So just reductions in stuff we expected, but not an all out ban on care."

Therefore, insurance companies and doctors previously could not discriminate against you just because you're trans - opening the door to HRT and surgeries nation wide.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron deference, so as such, the only way we will get gender affirming care or trans rights on a national level is if congress passes a law such as the Equality Act. That is highly unlikely for the foreseeable future. For now, the best bet is to move to a state with existing laws protecting trans folks."

His state also lobotomized more women than the entire south *combined*. We also have permanent incarceration without trial or parole thanks to our 'civil commitment' process for 'sex offenders'. I'm sure you've thumbed some of the stuff about project 2025.\n\n\nWhat you gotta understand about all of this is that Minnesota invented the two tier healthcare system. It's not a refugee state anymore than Auchwitz was a a \"safe haven\" -- remember the concentration camps started out as \"refugee cities\" too. And then they fired up the bulldozers and mass arrests as soon as everyone was in one spot. \n\n\nThe protections we have are on paper only. The DHS and our social services is thoroughly corrupted by regulatory capture as we've been transitioning to having all our social services moved into the private sector so a cottage industry of exploitative companies that focus on vulnerable adults and elder abuse has grown up in the state. Just a few weeks ago we had people hauling boxes upon boxes of documents out over the DHS' lack of licensing for autism services -- they've been shoveling money out the door to religious charities with no oversight and no checks and balances for years. \n\n\nSocial services do not exist for queer folk in this state. ErinInTheMorning is using a *legislative* map and I've called them out on that repeatedly because it's culturally insensitive and misleading to not include critical local knowledge and understanding for people considering moving here. \n\n\nPeople who come here will die. We are as racially segregated as Alabama -- look it up under 'natality' data -- ie percentage of births where both parents have the same race. Now you understand why the uprising started here. \n\n\nDo not come to Minnesota. He's killing us, all the democrats here are pick-me types, and our social services are completely f-cked. There has been heavy media suppression over just how bad the situation is here -- I have therapists, mental health providers, community outreach and advocacy organizations all consistently telling me that nobody who's trans in this state can get health care. It does not matter who you are, what your insurance is, whatever -- we've already fallen to the fascists. \n\n\nWalz lies."

Sorry about that, I got mixed up.\n\nIt seems to me, you think I‚Äôm on the republicans‚Äô side, and I want to clear up that I am not at all. If I had to choose between a republican and a democrat, I would choose the democrat every time.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing though: most politicians are looking out for themselves. Not all, and the ones who actually care are always democrats/liberal, but most. Why do you think Biden supports Israel‚Äôs genocide in Palestine? Maybe it‚Äôs because he just really likes Netanyahu, or maybe it‚Äôs because of the 20 billion dollars worth of weapons that we‚Äôre going to sell them ([source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/u-s-approves-20-billion-in-weapons-sales-to-israel-to-increase-long-term-military-capability)).\n\nTrans rights aren‚Äôt the only issue I base my morality off of. But let‚Äôs get back on topic. Yes, they passed the equality act, which is obviously a great thing. I‚Äôm not saying everything they do is wrong, they do a lot of good. But I highly doubt that deep down, most of them (or at least the prominent, powerful ones) actually care about us deeply. The bill that was passed (the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA) bans gender affirming care in the military. It was passed in the House, Senate, and signed by Biden. ([Source 1](https://www.them.us/story/senate-democrats-ndaa-chuck-schumer-tammy-baldwin-trans-healthcare-ban)([Source 2](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/president-biden-signs-defense-bill-blocking-health-care-for-trans-military-children-first-anti-lgbtq-federal-law-enacted-since-defense-of-marriage-act). They might not like that provision, but it clearly wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker.\n\nJust because someone says they care and does something beneficial for us, doesn‚Äôt mean they actually care. Why do you think Harris avoided the topic her campaign, and only said she would leave it up to the states? Probably because supporting us isn‚Äôt an electable position. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still would prefer her as president, and would have voted for her if I could have (same with any democrat that could have gone up against Trump). That doesn‚Äôt mean I like them, they are just the lesser of the two evils. \n\nAbout blue states: yes, they are very protected. I live in one myself, so I know that very well. But that‚Äôs because they have little to no opposition. Republicans in these states don‚Äôt have enough power to oppose us here. But if they were in close competition, we are the first ones they would throw out their support for, because we‚Äôre ‚Äúcontroversial.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like them. I‚Äôll support them because they are the best we have, but only because there isn‚Äôt a better option."

How does the theory of change work if when politicians explicitly support the things you ask, you just accuse them of lying because they are \"politicians\"? Who do you work with even to create coalitions to build support to pass policy etc? Why would anyone engage with you if you think they are all just lying anyways? What is the actual plan or logic here?\n\nDo you think MLK operated off the belief that Democrats were just lying in passing civil rights?"

They're not safe. \n\n\nYou have GOT to rely on word of mouth from other people in the community, people who have experienced community violence and discrimination and understand what it *actually* looks like because they're on the front line too. Advocacy groups are not particularly helpful right now -- they spend most of their time trying to get money and awareness from the cishets and act as clearinghouses for community resources, but those resources won't get you the name and number of a dentist that's safe. Or a nurse who's willing to palm you antibiotics because the ER doctor won't even put the gloves on or get out of his seat when you present with clear signs of pneumonia just like half of everyone in ER that night. A man who knows he can just sit there and smugly ignore it and there's nothing you can do, because the phrase 'duty of care' is now 'some restrictions apply, see rules for official details'. \n\n\nNot fun fact: Informed consent existed in Germany *prior* to the world wars. Those doctors just decided the Jews (and homosexuals) weren't human anymore, so the rules didn't apply. And with almost no effective government oversight and numerous privacy laws that prevent you from recording this kind of behavior and going public (people have tried, and they quickly and quietly wind up in jail and they'll rot there until they agree to get paroled on literally any charge that'll let them add the clause they can't discuss anything on social media or use a phone, etc. It's how they gag the public about it; The legal term is \"continued for dismissal\" and it was supposed to enable diversionary programs like defensive driving classes instead of fines. Now it's how they bludgeon anyone who tries to get activist on it into silence. A lot of us in the community don't just go missing because we were killed, went back in the closet, etc. Quite a few have gotten gagged by the system. That and the fact we have no journalistic shield laws so if you show the reporter the evidence the only thing you've done is made sure it's now two people sitting in jail.\n\n\nThat's the no bullsh-t how it works. It's objectively horrifying, and the general public is allowing this to happen because trans rights aren't important to them, it's yk, economy this and job that, they're food insecure and etc., etc., so it's easy to believe that instead of being the canary in the coal mine telling everyone there's something dangerous is in the air and absolutely is going to kill them too... we're just getting free plastic surgery and living some sort of liberal lie because something something biology or whatever."

But it‚Äôs awfully hard to see any good in our system when you really dig into American politics. \n\n> They are people who grew up in America and have values beliefs that any other American has went into politics to act on those values and beliefs.\n\nI completely agree, that‚Äôs why they get into politics. What other reason could there be? The problem is, American politics are extremely cutthroat. It‚Äôs hard to win on a highly controversial opinion, and right now the controversial opinion is us. Like I said in the first comment, the representatives and state congress of my state are among the only ones I like because even though we are being attacked and weaponized, they don‚Äôt waver in their support. I also said ‚Äúthe only ones I know of‚Äù because I don‚Äôt know anything about the representatives for every blue state. The fact that they are so well protected, means they probably care too. But the ones on Capitol Hill? Most of them seem to support us when it‚Äôs convenient. Just look at the support for the NDAA. \n\nJust because someone has LGBTQ family members they care about, doesn‚Äôt mean they will stand up for us even when it‚Äôs inconvenient. As you mentioned, Harris has a queer daughter, and I am sure she loves her and supports her very much. But why would she leave LGBTQ rights completely out of her campaign? Because it‚Äôs too unpopular of an opinion. LGBTQ rights are being weaponized, and the country is becoming more conservative. There are two ways democrats can go. They can stick firm to their values in order to protect marginalized groups, or they can keep moving toward the center to gain swing voters. Guess which one they are going to do.\n\nAlso, as I mentioned, LGBTQ rights are not the only issue I base this on. The fact is that a lot of them (including Biden and Harris) support Israel committing genocide on Palestine. Harris thinks Israel has a right to ‚Äúdefend itself‚Äù against Palestine, but has yet to say the same for Palestine, even though they are the victims of literal war crimes. That alone is enough for me to not like those particular democrats.\n\nSaying they don‚Äôt care about us was a poor choice of words. What I mean is that they don‚Äôt care enough to stand up for us when it‚Äôs unpopular. During Biden‚Äôs campaign, they were all pretty vocal about their support for us, but as soon as Trump used us a a bogeyman, they not only support us less, but some have even blamed us for being the reason Harris lost. ([source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna179370)). \n\nThey might be fighting it right now, but it‚Äôs pretty clear they won‚Äôt keep supporting us if it could cost them their job. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really trust a lot of them."

The reason I don't want to be ugly is kinda twofold.\n\nOn one hand not being ugly would make passing easier. It would be easier to be myself without having to worry about the people around me reacting violently to my existence. I'm constantly worried about how people will react to me as a visibly trans woman considering what I hear when I'm boymoding/pretending to be a guy. That fear is a big part of why I'm not presenting feminine most days.\n\nAnd on the other, it's kinda stupid vanity. I've always had an image of who I would be if I transitioned and being ugly wasn't in that image. I wasn't expecting to be a supermodel level beauty or something like that but I'd always thought I would look okay at least. Just average. Like my mother or sister. So being ugly hurts. Its not who I've always imagined being. Who I am when I dream at night. This isn't me and it hurts. But I can't fix this unless I win the lottery or get hit by a rich fuck's car. Also doesn't help that I missed the supposed \"best years of your life\" and I wish I could have just a tiny bit of that now. It's stupid I know but it still hurts.\n\nI don't know if that makes sense but that's why I don't want to be an ugly trans woman."

Sone may have mental issues but who doesn't? We don't really know what is normal to be honest. We are living a life that has been set for us by people. People telling us the standard way to live which isn't rational for 8 billion people with a mind and feelings of their own. Most hetero people aren't going to accept it. Many hide the truth about not liking trans women. Most cis women do this ALOT. You will find yourself in a never ending battle for acceptance by them if you fall for the games. The truth is they will move the goal post Everytime. Think of running and you see the finish line and then it's moved Everytime you get close. If you don't play their game then they're angry as well. Most cis women feel they're the REAL WOMEN and you are beneath them. This is also untrue. I've seen many trans women get with men that some cis women could NEVER. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Beauty also comes from more than just your looks it's your personality, your kindness, and wit among other things. When it comes to other trans women it's about competition and being passable. You have cis women in competition as well but because their cis there is a cognitive dissonance that comes with it. With trans women they will pick you apart because there goal is to fit in to society which I don't see happening anytime soon depending on where you live in the world. People set standards and if you don't meet them somehow you aren't qualified which is bs. Live your life for you. If you want surgery and can afford it get it. The ultimate question is how do you feel? Do you feel great living in your skin if the answer is yes then you should care about anything else except living life and being a great person. Society looks to tear people apart because most are unhappy or feel like they're gods gift to the world and anyone who they see as a threat has to be annihilated. It's a shame that we have so much hate in this world. So much division. Be happy, and celebrate yourself and the people who love you it's not worth the hassle trying to meet standards to make OTHERS comfortable. You are enough."

However, if I'm not passing, that still puts my looks in the category of man rather than woman. My dysphoria has always been very much driven by the physical aspects of my body that are coded as, and read as, male. I feel like my dysphoria isn't being treated as valid, when I'm being expected to be okay with those physical aspects that have always caused me so much distress, and that not being able to do so is somehow \"internal transphobia\". It's not so much being ugly thay causes me distress as much as looking like a \"man trying to be a woman\" that's causing the distress. And there's bugger all I can do about that aspect of my self loathing. Its always been there, and always will be."

Pity, as I dress up pretty well and really deserve a second look! And really, I don't mind at all, about my looks or lack thereof, those things don't get in my way. I'm happy and living life.

Now, that is me talking. I have no idea how the rest of the world sees me, nor do I care, but what I do know is that my little posse of cig gender gals I work and play with think the most of me and love what I am pulling off, and that is being a woman in their midst, even if this woman doesn't always look runway ready. And truly, what is that, anyway? All the years I have spent studying up women and their fashion, cataloging what they wear to the store or to my place of business, and on the most part they are dressed down, jeans, sweats, slippers and pj's, to do business! Do they seem to care? Not that I can tell. Is there a time when they do? Who knows? No matter how the rest of the women in the world present, I am, in my mind, Vogue material. After that, who cares.

I stopped pretending that I was ever going to pass, least ways, pass by their standards. Who needs their goal posts, their finish lines, their moveable standards?

I seen a trans woman who is now famous not even play the game and not care for cis womens approval and they came together to try to destroy her success as well as mental health and well-being they posted her home address online just so many horrible things but then Beyonce stepped in and worked with her. I feel Beyonce endorsed her with working with her and gave her stamp of approval which made some stop and others even madder lol but Beyonce name alone holds so much weight so the trans woman won. I find it beautiful. I don't think people should have to fight to be treated as a human being. I don't know where you live but in America where I am it's very much competition with EVERYTHING. I didn't realize it before going through an awakening. I no longer feel the need to prove myself to ppl. I can do my best and my work will show for itself. It's about popularity for most ppl. If you have ppl who are well respected behind you the right doors of success open but if you don't it's extremely difficult. I've been a great person my whole life. I'm not perfect but I'm definitely a great person and I have been betrayed, lied on setup physically mentally financially and emotionally abused. I'm currently homeless carless and jobless. I had ppl with power come together tap my phone so when applying for jobs they would call so I wouldn't get hired. There are evil ppl in this world. Money power and connections can ruin a person's life. I lost everything. Family can be the worst as well. I've been through it. I was told I didn't need a car when I do because where I live isn't walkable to anywhere. I'm just so sick of evil ppl. I didn't do anything to anyone except help them and they disrespected me.

I don't know if you've been around gay men or other trans women but it's no better. Gay men seem to hate trans women and it mostly comes from the fact that either they're really trans and don't have the courage to transition or because men they're attracted to are into trans women and cis women and not gay men. Ppl refuse to acknowledge there's a huge difference between trans women and gay men. They acknowledge it but try to group it all together which shouldn't be done they just label it as that gay shit. Other trans women can also be a huge problem. Jealously and  envy. Most carry it and you wouldn't even know it could be your confidence that they hate not your looks. Trans hurt is worse than anything even worse than you're family because trans women know each other's lives experience better than anyone else. Sticking together should be the goal but it's not. It's the same with the black community. This world is just messed up and trying to fix it alone is impossible."

I have noticed a tendency for trans women to be berated for feeling distress/dysphoria over things that a cis woman would recieve empathy and compassion for having similar feelings."

My best chances of looking more feminine at this point in my transition would be to lean into being tall, elegant, intense and regal, because that‚Äôs how people tend to see me, but that really has never been who I have felt I am, and it mega sucks sometimes.\n\nHowever, I feel there are certain truths that absolutely hurt coming from cis people who just don‚Äôt get it, that don‚Äôt hurt as much from trans people. They are ‚Äústop caring so much what people think of you‚Äù and ‚Äúaccept what you can‚Äôt change and change what you can‚Äù. Cringing at myself just typing it. \n\nWhen people dismiss dysphoria as silly body image issues it frustrates me, and can make me feel totally alone in my suffering, but ultimately, looking like a man or woman really is in the eye of the beholder. I can‚Äôt control what other people think, and I can‚Äôt change my height. This is forever. But people‚Äôs minds are changing and have been, and I feel we have a responsibility (regardless of how we feel about our own appearance) to change the way we talk about cis passing, and ‚Äúlooking like a man‚Äù etc. for the sake of all trans people. My mantra is, ‚ÄúI look like a woman because I am a woman.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not still getting FFS, and I try to extend that courtesy to others. Our transitions are all personal and unique, and we need to advocate for all trans people to be recognized as who they say they are regardless of what they look like in any given moment, and it starts with the way we talk about ourselves both alone and out loud."

Like I said, if I was a cis woman who looked exactly how I look now, I'd recieve a lot more empathy, but because I'm trans, it's like I'm expected to just suck it up, and let it be like water off a duck's back.

I cannot overstate how many trans folk, especially those who‚Äôve only ever been involved with cis people, to keep only considering cis people when there are other trans people out there (barring, ofc, internalized transphobia around dating another trans person which, alas, can be a thing with some trans folk)."

By the time they can do that, I‚Äôm gonna be done and leaving anyways.\n\nBut on the federal level, they might try to force private companies into doing something. We‚Äôll see."

If I want an excuse to get into the women‚Äôs restroom I don‚Äôt need to pretend to be transgender, but let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs the route I wanna use\n\nIn a trans friendly state I gotta buy a dress and makeup (an obstacle of cost), dress up as a woman (which not every would-be sexual assaulted would be willing to do for their assaults), and go out dressed as a woman (a social obstacle, given they‚Äôd risk being seen by those they know). All those obstacles will reduce the number of people willing and able to try that method out\n\nThen there‚Äôs another problem. Most rapes are by people known to the victim, but obviously that wouldn‚Äôt apply in this sorta situation, since the disguise would fail on such people. So we‚Äôre only considering those towards strangers, which would by virtue of them being strangers almost entirely be crimes of opportunity, not planned. Like as in ‚ÄúI see a beautiful woman walking into the bathroom, better follow her,‚Äù as opposed to ‚ÄúI know the schedules of people I don‚Äôt know well enough to plan an assault‚Äù\n\nBut if you‚Äôre out at a bar and see a beautiful woman going into the bathroom, you can‚Äôt exactly run home, get changed, run back, and expect her to still be there. So actual crimes of opportunity would be stricken, leaving only planned rapes of strangers, which are negligible. And that‚Äôs not even getting into the fact there are sooo many better options for someone vile enough to want an excuse to get into a women‚Äôs restroom to assault someone‚Ä¶ Like saying you just thought it was the men‚Äôs if you‚Äôre caught‚Ä¶\n\nMeanwhile in a trans-unfriendly state, you ain‚Äôt gotta do any of that. ‚ÄúOops, I‚Äôm a trans man. No, see, I‚Äôm with you! I *wish* I could use the men‚Äôs restroom, but them *pesky laws* say I *gotta* use this one! Sorry, ladies; deal with it!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust make them all show IDs upon request!‚Äù So any guy who wants to can just demand her ID if she tries to use the bathroom and use it to check out her home address? Doesn‚Äôt sound very safe to me. And women will have to all carry IDs if they wanna use the bathroom? What about the ones that don‚Äôt have any? Or who don‚Äôt have it at home? Are they just gonna be expected to go in the alleyway outside? That‚Äôs neither benefits women‚Äôs safety *or* privacy! But letting them in means letting their hypothetical rapists in\n\nNot to mention it‚Äôs not like men would be so negatively affected. Only women. ‚ÄòCause no one‚Äôs arguing for men‚Äôs privacy. Except it‚Äôs not just women, either. It‚Äôs only gonna be the women who don‚Äôt live up to some random stranger‚Äôs expectations of how she should look and behave if it‚Äôs not womanly enough for these people\n\nOr maybe IDs aren‚Äôt the right route. Then what? Genital inspections of anyone who isn‚Äôt feminine enough- including the aforementioned women who aren‚Äôt acting satisfactorily feminine enough for these random people at the bar they‚Äôre at?"

While plenty of trans people pass as cis, there are also plenty that don't at the moment (including many who have no desire to). It's not really intended to be perfect, but to intimidate. Many trans people who do typically pass might not use public bathrooms, especially if they haven't had \"all the surgeries\" because if someone takes an issue with them and is particularly invasive, then they could be at particular risk."

Let's not be delusional and think all is perfect but there us some hope in this regard.\n\nPersonally I went through transitional genesis while working. It was very scary but since I work for a city department and have protection from discrimination and harassment by law I was able to work with management to resolve bathroom issue (along with other stuff) in reasonable time span and manner. We had meetings with experts and management and they helped me \"come out\" and set policy including use of appropriate facilities. At first it was a separate washroom (separately available in other area and under key/lock system) and then when I felt comfortable and it was made clear to ladies I'd be sharing, I progressed to f/t women's room.\n\nWhen out and about it's harder and it gets murky, especially if I'm not all feeling femmed up or looking it, especially in a bar. I weigh out options in this case and am ready for challenges but stand my ground if needed. Since there is always risk of being questioned it's scary but in my case luckily I can rely on my identification that clearly shows \"F\" as identifier in the case they want proof. They will likely never ask because it would open them up to liability for court challenge since they will never start or enforce a gender verification process at point of entry for ALL women and so it comes down to discrimination/ profiling and harassment that could cost them. Besides, who would staff the doors to implement it and would they feel comfortable doing so? If I was asked by staff to prove it I may or not show my ID. If asked to see my genitals I would summon police and media."

If they see you as a male \"acting\" as a girl or being queer or weak can lead to many problems, not leastly violence. Yet to be perceived as a male in the women's washroom is also problematic because females can feel threatened or somehow challenged or slighted, thus uncomfortable, so they can get nasty. \n\nIt is a very tough situation we all must unfortunately still face, especially where bigotry is rampant along with too many mouth breathing Neanderthals.\nSometimes it's just better to \"hold it\" or wait patiently to attack whichever bathroom you have the courage and mind to use, depending on how passable you feel that day as either gender. I say either because at some point it can become unclear if you appear androgynous. Feeling insecure and lacking confidence can also attract unwanted attention so it's best to pull up your panties and just go in with confidence and be ready with a defense that will work.\n\nSad times we are in but hopefully in time, with our perseverance and efforts we will make change and things will become easier for all, including the ones who follow us.\n\nGood luck! Stay strong and be you!"

The topic is just close to my heart.\n\nI have no idea what that is but I'm surprised I somewhat agree with something so controversial\n\nBut yeah, acting as if we're morally superior is the slippery slope. The faster we realize that we can turn into monsters, the easier it is to live. Once we start condemning people instead of listening to them, we become the very thing that we fight against.\n\nI've had normal, honest talks with homophobes as a queer person. With transphobes as a trans person. With misogynistic assholes as a feminist.\n\nYeah, there are outliers who won't ever be convinced. But while deconstructing my narcissism, I've realized that convincing is exactly the problem. Human rights are objectively good but I promise that your average person who is against some of them doesn't do it because they're evil.\n\nI thought I was good when I was treating non-binary people like scum. I thought I was defending my friends from being othered, that non-binary was exactly the thing that held us back from transphobes listening to us.\n\nThen I stopped trying to win against them and started asking them questions. Learning about their lives, why do they think a certain way, why do they feel like that. I stopped convincing and condemning, I started listening. Discussing. Trying to see the world from their perspective.\n\nIt might be a backhanded compliment, to hear from a homophobe that you're one of the \"good gays\" but I didn't earn that because I tried to pander. I earned that because I stood by my point but validated their feelings. \"Oh, yeah, I guess the parades do look scary if you're not one of us. I can see that. I get scared by huge amounts of people too. To be honest, I'd freak out if I wasn't in the community and I saw the recordings that go around.\"\n\nNo need to lie. No need to bend your words. Just plain talk, be honest, hear them. And sometimes, that one \"good gay\" can cause them to warm up just a little. I probably leave, because one discussion will never change their entire viewpoint. But they will remember me, just like I remember them. I did change something in them, just like all of them changed me. Just like my friends did, one talk after another, easing me into the water, so I don't get hypothermia.\n\nThere are no truly bad people and there are no truly good people. And even thinking one can decide who is who is discrimination."

Tack on the usual ‚Äúmoderate right‚Äù men like David French and orthodox-right Ross Douthat, and it‚Äôs a train wreck.\n\nEven with the Times giving non-binary essayist M. Gessen more column time lately and other staff columnists making the occasional and symbolic paeans of recognizing how transphobia is an actual thing (from Lydia Polgreen, Jamelle Bouie and Charles Blow), it‚Äôs otherwise a feeding frenzy as the above anti-trans columnists have prime-time slots during the week when readership is at its highest. The recent inclusion of Gessen reads like a dead tree voluntary gesture of traditional, ‚ÄúFairness Doctrine‚Äù-like signalling in an age when that doctrine has been dead for decades.\n\nThe mask-off anti-trans animus really got underway from 2022, around when Paul started being both a columnist and a concern-trolling ‚Äújournalist‚Äù with pieces which resembled journalism, but were thinly-dressed polemics against trans people and the primacy of biological essentialism and determinism.\n\nThe NYT is basura, and they‚Äôre very consciously doing so.

Both rectal and vaginal suppositories are mentioned.\n\nWhile there are no studies on the use of progesterone in trans women, it‚Äôs absolutely untrue that there is no medical data on boofing P. You‚Äôll also notice that these studies focus on rectal and/or vaginal suppositories, specifically because the bioavailability of those routes of administration are so much better than oral (and before you say anything about ‚Äútoo high of a dosage‚Äù, I‚Äôll point out that these studies, as well as common medical practice for these conditions, use 400mg suppositories, which is already 2x-3x higher than what trans women typically use.

You stated that you still identify as male, this would mean by the definition alone you wouldn't be trans (though we are about to get into a deeper understanding of what it means to be trans).\n\nTrans people are not a monolith and we don't all have the same experiences or even the same goals with our transition. Some of us (myself included) don't have issues with our birth genitals. Wanting to change your body to more align with the opposite sex (to any degree) could absolutely be considered trans. Though gender nonconforming people are not necessarily trans.\n\nThere are more than just trans men and trans women that exist (non-binary people and gender fluid people as a couple examples). Who may align with some parts of the masculine and feminine aspects of gender. For example if you were to go on hormones so that you would grow boobs, but didn't have dysphoria with your facial hair so you didn't do anything to remove it. You are stating that you only want a vagina but don't have plans to change any other part of yourself so Non-binary could fit you.\n\nAll that to say, unfortunately we can't tell you where you fit, however if you want to consider yourself trans, then welcome to the community, the MtF and TransSurgeries subreddit would be great places to find more information about a Vaginoplasty. If you don't want to consider yourself trans, but more just a gender nonconforming guy then I wish you all the best (and the MtF and TransSurgeries subreddits would still be great places to find information on a Vaginoplasty).\n\nHave a wonderful day my friend üíï"

Worth a google anyway). It is possible to have a vaginaplasty that preserves the testes if you want to pick testosterone and don't want to take HRT.\n\n\nYou could too, if you wanted to pick estrogen, have a preemptive masectomy to remove any tissue that could grow so you wouldn't grow breasts.\n\n\nAdditionally, you might want to check out r/nonbinary and see if any of that resonates with you. Nonbinary is a big umbrella term for 'not-man-not-woman'.\n\n\nA lot of nonbinary people seek 'inbetween', 'mixed', or 'androgynous' presentations and a subset of those use he/him, you might find someone there whose experience would be helpful even if you're not NB.\n\n\n\nAnd just remember that 'Trans' is just a word that's useful because it describes a shared experience. You could identity as trans, even be on estrogen and still use He/Him and be a guy.\n\n\n\nYou should be you. Do what you want to do, use whatever pronouns you want to use, have whatever surgeries you want to, and use whatever labels are helpful to describe your experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è.\n\n\nNot trying to tell you who you are, just letting you know that you're allowed to be you, and that it's all valid üôÇ.

The healing process is long and uncomfortable--a few people I know were in extremely intense pain for weeks to months after theirs--and it feels like a slap in the face; especially when I consider how many of my friends can't afford it, lack resources, or can't safely be out. I was fortunate enough to get it, and my healing process wasn't too painful, but it still sucked, and I had to wait more than two years after initially scheduling it. Any trans person's scars or experiences aren't cute things to wear as a costume\n\nThat said, in full support of OP. This sounds like a completely different situation and, as a trans guy who is totally happy with the genitals I was born with, I can absolutely understand wanting to be a man with a vagina"

My plan for if I wasn't happy with my nipples was to get some chest tattoos to mask them. I'm sure you've already considered it, but I do know a tattooist who does natural looking nipple tattoos for people who get mastectomies, and her work is incredible! I hope you can find a way to at least make everything aesthetically appealing to you! I was lucky and have regained mild sensation in them within just a little over 3 months (actually much sooner), and the rest of my chest never lost any sensation; but so many people I know had complications. \n\nBig agree though. Nothing is changed by it not being an exclusively transmasc surgery. Considering the reasons for full mastectomies are generally dysphoria--regardless of gender--or breast cancer, it seems incredibly disrespectful and insensitive to just tattoo those on when you never had or needed the surgery. People with these scars went through some traumatic shit to get where they are. I do love seeing tattoos on people whose scars faded or who just want something more flashy but, again, completely different situation"

    "comment_body": "Starting before puberty, at least on blockers, is often the *point*, if someone knows this about themselves before puberty. As going through the *wrong* puberty, when someone already knows that it‚Äôs the *wrong* puberty is one of the things that can make likelihood of suicide skyrocket. If your kid already knows they want to medically transition, then it‚Äôs best to support that imo. It‚Äôs fair to ask for some sort of simple compromise, like that they go to an affirming therapist who can help them make sure they are sure about it, and who can also help communicate their needs to you, as parents (at least from personal experience as a kid) often take more seriously or with more gravity the things being told to them by a fellow adult or by someone closer to their age, then they do someone younger than them/their kid/someone they might view as not fully being able to make their own decisions. My parents were generally supportive from the start, but even though I was already and adult and they knew I‚Äôd do what I wanted anyway, it wasn‚Äôt until they had my therapist communicate to them how actually serious I was about transitioning and how helpful it really would be fore me and what I actually needed in terms of support from them, that they were able to actually be fully on board and be able to do things like use the correct name and pronouns etc. So something like that may be helpful as parents. But imo it sounds like your kid is really sure, and like this is something that has been in their mind for many years at this point. Just try and remember that for them it has likely been something they‚Äôve been with for that long, even if for you it‚Äôs mostly new info about them. And they may want to start moving quickly now they‚Äôve taken the first step. But moving forward might be the pace they are ready to go at, even if you‚Äôre not ready for that, just because the age of the info of them being trans is different for them than it is for you. They‚Äôve had this in their head for years, while you‚Äôve had it maybe only a couple days/weeks/months."

There is a huge wave of anti-trans and generally socially-conservative-to-far-right sentiment in much of the Western world right now, a backlash against decades of progress against racial discrimination, for women's rights, gay rights, trans rights, etc. This is not going to be great for the mental health of those targeted by these hate campaigns and will increase hate crimes.\n\nIt is true that there is a high suicidal ideation and attempt rate among LGBT youth, especially, trans youth. But those with at least one supportive adult in their life to cling to have a much lower rate. It's not intrinsic to being transgender, it's just a result of the constant barrage of attacks and discrimination and feeling alone and helpless. Ethnic minorities receive a lot of discrimination and hatred in the media and public opinion but many live in enclaves with people who are like them and have family members who are also like them. But LGBT people of any ethnicity often have to struggle to be around other people like them in that regard. That's why neighborhoods like Soho in London are formed.\n\nI think finding Mermaids ( [https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/) ), Gendered Intelligence ( [https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/) ), or other other local groups of trans youth for community would help greatly. Also, you as a parent could talk to other parents in your area who are going through the same thing. The fact that you are asking for help means that you are focusing on your child's needs and not being angry at them for being LGBT or trying to beat it out of them or something and that means a lot to a scared child.\n\nThe world is getting darker and scarier for a lot of people. But if we stick together, we can build love and hope and community."

If there's any way for you to meet other *supportive* parents of trans kids, or any way for her to meet other trans kids her age, please try to make that happen. (I'm specifying *supportive* because some groups for trans parents are very \"those disgusting perverts got their claws into my innocent son and I want revenge,\" which is obviously not going to help.) r/cisparenttranskid is a good place to start asking about where to find one. Probably also r/transgenderUK. \n\nBeing able to connect with peers and allies in person, and not just online, is really helpful for kids who are trying to learn social skills and how to dress themselves and stuff, and also just good for helping you both feel less alone."

They wouldn‚Äôt have come out to you unless they felt safe enough, so consider their sharing a huge compliment!\n\nI know you‚Äôre in the early days and you‚Äôre still getting your own thoughts together and you‚Äôre going to make mistakes ‚Äî just do your best to recognize them, apologize (if appropriate), fix them, and move on.\n\nThat said, a good way to reduce the mistakes is to actively change your thinking. Make an effort to call your kid something gender-neutral until they are clear what to call them. You might notice I‚Äôve been using ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù pronouns - that‚Äôs more because, based on what you‚Äôve shared, we don‚Äôt know which pronouns your child prefers, and I‚Äôd rather err on using non-gendered pronouns until you have those answers. I‚Äôve also avoided gendered relationship names (son/daughter) in favor of ‚Äúchild‚Äù, and ‚Äúkid‚Äù - this is similar to pronouns ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be wrong calling your kid ‚Äúmy child‚Äù, ‚Äúmy oldest/youngest/etc‚Äù or, if you‚Äôre feeling frisky, ‚Äúspawn‚Äù, ‚Äúfruit of my loins‚Äù, or a number of other humorous titles.\n\nNow, trans parenting 101: it‚Äôs *your* responsibility to educate yourself on what being trans means, the concepts involved, the language specific to our world and experiences, and the potential pathways your kid has available. It‚Äôs your kid‚Äôs responsibility to be a kid and to figure out their identity. It will take time, and it may seem like there are false starts and dead ends before they figure things out ‚Äî give them the space and safety to do so and make sure they know you‚Äôre 100% on their side and there to help.\n\nIf they offer information and education, accept it gladly. But if not, don‚Äôt ask them to educate you. Ask them which pronouns they‚Äôd like (and let them know that if they ever want to use/try out different ones, you‚Äôre 100% there for that too), if they‚Äôd like to get clothes, decorations, hair styles, etc which are a better fit for them. Don‚Äôt be pushy, but don‚Äôt wait for them to ask ‚Äî they might not feel comfortable yet. You want to foster an environment where they continue to know you‚Äôre safe and supportive.\n\nYou‚Äôve got this. You‚Äôre already on the right track. You‚Äôre doing just fine. Keep it up!"

Could he be gay? In the 1990s, the GIDS service in England reported that only 5%of trans kids went on to be trans as the vast majority were actually gay. You mentioned that he is autistic. 35% of children seen by the Tavistock Centre in London were autistic. Many children who said they were trans had underlying abuse in some setting. Are his friends doing this so he's getting the idea of doing it? Is he having difficulty fitting in with other boys his age and fits in more easily with girls because they're nicer to him and are more welcoming?\n\nThe odds of being trans are no greater than 1% and could be even less than that. It could be that your child is actually trans and may medically transition at some point in his life. Good luck to him if he does. But to claim that you should just affirm his stated identity without thinking and exploring why he is presenting like that could cause you to take steps that he will regret later in life."

I didn't realise he'd posted this and found it through searching for posts from people in similar situations. \n\nNot sure if anyone is still reading the thread but to add some context, husband and I are both CIS, male and female. This is an entirely new world to us both so I apologise if I use the wrong terminology. Our daughter is MTF. \n\nAs my husband mentioned, our daughter has autism and as part of that, navigates the world by embodying different roles and personalities; most commonly video game/TV characters. I think my husband and I are both confused as to whether her identifying as female now is an extension of this, or who she truly feels she is. I'm leaning towards the latter as she is not currently replicating a specific female character. Obviously this is a conversation we need to have IRL but will become apparent over the coming months regardless.\n\nShe came out to me around 2 months ago and has within the last few days felt able to tell her dad, friends and other family members. Everyone has been supportive which I'm thrilled about, though I am worried about potential repercussions from strangers who aren't so accepting. This week at school she is going to ask teachers to call her by her preferred name and has asked us to buy the female version of the uniform. \n\nThank you to those who have left advice and kind comments. We will love and support her no matter what the future holds."

After some time and important discussions, hopefully, that gender therapist can write a treatment recommendation and you can get a prescription for feminising HRT from your GP or privately. I genuinely recommend that as long as your child seems certain that this is what she wants and especially if the therapist thinks she is unlikely to desist you allow her to start HRT as soon as she possibly can since without blockers a male puberty will cause so many irreversible masculinising changes and if she really is trans this will very likely lead to worse dysphoria possibly causing depression and suicidality and potentially leave her desiring extremely expensive surgeries in the future many of which aren't covered by the NHS.\n\nIn addition to this route (which is only available if you have the disposable income to pay for things like private specialised therapists and treatment recommendations, I'm sorry) there's no harm in starting the process of referring her to an NHS GIC. Even if you think it's possible that this is just a phrase and she will desist the waitlists are so long that starting the process now will still give her plenty of time (seriously, *plenty*) to know if this is what she really wants. You can speak to your GP about this referral and they make refer her to another specialist for an evaluation first or you may be able to do this through a private therapist if you are taking her to see one anyway. She will be referred to the Tavistock in London which is the gender identity clinic that deals with care for minors here in England. It is unlikely she will even see anyone for an appointment before she is 20 so when she is 17, you will have to phone them up and have them transfer her to an adult waitlist. If you think I'm exaggerating I was referred to the Tavistock at 16, and am now 22 and still haven't seen anyone for so much as an initial appointment, and the waiting lists have only gotten longer and more populated since my referral in 2019.\n\nI wish you and your daughter the best of luck. I know it could always be worse, and there are places where this kind of thing gets you stoned to death, and free medical care is free medical care even if you have to wait over half a decade for it... but this is a horrible time and place to be trans."

She didn't show any signs of anything even close to self termination. I did everything you can imagine to affirm her gender and give her a future with hope. We even talked openly about about how 40% of us attempt.\n\nThat's a coin flip. Flip a coin, call it, if you lose...\n\nI'm not saying your kid is about to do the same. I'm simply telling you to be very fucking aware of everything. Especially especially especially when hormones kick in.\n\nThe wrong hormones will certainly hurt her mental state. It may be mild, but it could be literally the most severe thing a human can go through, and even on your best awareness, you may not see it. \n\nNo matter how supportive you are, her country hates her, and she damn well feels it every second she draws breath. On top of this, she will not have access to medical care for years. Both of those still fit her squarely within the 40% risk, even if you are as supportive as another human can be.\n\nTrans people are the best people in the world at hiding their emotions.

Fundamentalists. They are not happy\n\nI've met quite a few trans people with trans siblings over the years.\n\nWe don't know all the details about what causes people to be trans and it's likely a mix of causes. There are studies on gay men that show that there's some genetic component. Lesbians and trans people are much less studied.  \n  \nDES was an anti-miscarriage hormone therapy that caused some serious problems, even to the grandchildren of the mothers who took DES. There was a higher rate of gay men among \"DES sons\" and significantly fewer lesbians among \"DES daughters\", so that suggests that the hypothesis of prenatal hormone washes have some effect on sexual orientation and potentially on gender identity. But we don't know.\n\nIt's also possible that there's just kind of a birthday problem. If you have a group of people in a room, you only need 23 people for there to be a 50-50 chance that two people have the same birthday. If you assume 1% of people are trans and everyone has 1 sibling, then there's a 1/1000 chance that a trans person has a trans sibling. You need to have met 40 trans people to have 50-50 chance of having met a trans person with a trans sibling.

Knowing that trans youth have a high rate of suicide made me get myself together to support my kids. Have I said the wrong thing at times and upset them? Yes, I have, but they know I love them and that I am willing to learn and change my thinking.\n\n2) I believe in body autonomy. I am not going to hold my kids‚Äô financial dependence on me over their heads to take that away from them.\n\n3) Transitioning and dealing with discrimination is so difficult. Why would anyone choose this path if they could live with the privilege of being cisgender?\n\nI think ftm have an advantage over mtf in terms of puberty having devastating effects on the ability to affirm their gender identity. NC also passed a law in 2023 that bans transgender care for trans youth under 18.

A bit more boobs. Less muscle. More butt and hip. Softer face. Imagine going through that. Then add high school to it. \n\nThe good news is that before good information became available, plenty of trans women successfully transitioned in adult hood. It‚Äôs harder. The results aren‚Äôt quite as good. They may need surgery to repair the damage done (same as you‚Äôd likely get boobs removed if you were forced on estrogen). But plenty of happy adult trans women exist. \n\nMany also have autism and adhd. For poorly understood reasons the comorbidity is high. But hold onto your daughter. She‚Äôs in for a tough time. But with parental support she can survive and even, eventually, thrive. \n\nThat said if you can move to another country it will save your child 6 years of agonizing torture."

For the case of puberty blocker i am neutral like i said too. I see the good side and bad side of it. The good side is that the transition is better and more fluid. (Don't know how to tell it in other way) The bad side is that affect fertility and giving to a child that hesitate or the diagnostic is not already sure, so for \"gaining time\" we block they hormones and possibly block their fertility is a no for me. But if that can help for a sooner transition for children with diagnostic i can understand the utillity for this situation. (I don't compare trans as disease, ust that children cases are more complex and need some wxperts to see if the cild is really trans)\n\nBy the way, i tell qbout what i know of trans transitionning. I don't understand why people do negative rate on my original post. I wanted just to share my pov of open minded person. Like i try to tell clearly, i can't decide if the medication is good or not because i don't know to much about the cases applied exactly. But that doesn't mean that i will not support for personality development for trans people. I mean if they want to be more feminine or more masculine i am not against that. I am not against trans people. I have to take some serious medication from my childhood to today and these kind of medication is not adapted to everyone. So people who don't need my medication can have really bad side effect. So it's kinda the same minset. I don't want to give to a medication that might not be needed.\n\nAnd because the community seem to not like my open minded pov even i am not against trans directly, that i decided to just not answer anymore after this one. I mean i not ask for war, i not ask to ban trans medication, i not ask to make trans to jail. I just wanted to share my open minded pov. I just want to underatand too, but what i see is not explaining me but just the negative rating with vague question that doesn't explain how i am far away from the reality.

They did way more than what a lot of parents would do and being from the UK we have a lot more to face than pronouns currently- OP seems supportive and honestly that‚Äôs really going to help their access to services and streamline their ability to get HRT when they‚Äôre old enough (as puberty blockers have just been banned in the UK for trans children)."

I knew there was something deep down about me that was fundamentally unacceptable, and that \"it would be bad\" if anyone ever saw what it was - but I could never figure out what it was, and after decades of trying I gave up and settled into simply enduring the cold, hazy gray existence I'd been cursed with, silently hoping each day might mercifully be my last.\n\n\nI've often said that the first lie society ever told me was, \"It's a boy\", and they only increased and continued from there for nearly the next half century until I finally saw the truth through it all and escaped.¬†\n\n\nThe last couple years of my life are the first ones I've ever truly *lived*. I wish that decades earlier I could have had access to the knowledge and words to understand and express who I was and what I felt, but that didn't happen.¬†\n\n\nI'm here now though, and I intend to make the most of whatever time I have remaining. I'm finally me, and I'm done hiding or apologizing for it."

As an adult, I blocked all of my feminine qualities and remained in the closet until I was about 45. Long time to wait, for sure.\n\nI would just like to add what I know about transgender psychology. This really helped me to understand who I am and how people develop their identity over time\n\nYour human identity is composed of your physical sex, your sexual preference, your mode of expression, and your gender. (And for me, I consider gender to be your mind.) In my opinion, all humans exist in a combination of all of these. They're almost like sliders on a character creator. \n\nI'm no mathematician, but I think the numbers are *roughly* 3x5x3x12 giving 540 combinations:\n\n3 base sexes (male, female, intersex) \n\nX 5 base sexual preferences (gay, straight, bi, asexual, fluid ) - granted some people believe that there are actually hundreds.)\n\nX 3 base modes of expression (male, female, fluid - both male and female) \n\nX 12 base genders (male, female, transgender, gender neutral, non-binary, agender, pangender, genderqueer, two-spirit, third gender, and all, or none.)\n\n(If there's someone better with numbers, enlighten me, as I always forget the combination.)\n\nI just wish that people understood that gender equates to mind and not physical body, self-expression or sexual preference. That confusion perpetuated by the mainstream media is infuriating a times. (Every time I hear about a gender reveal party, I want to punch a hole in the wall. It's a SEX reveal; that's it. Full stop. The child is ultimately going to be a combination of all four of those components. \n\nJust my two cents, and thanks again for posting. I wish more people could read this and understand how difficult it is to go through what we do."

I was too hobbled by my maltreatment and depression to advance myself much beyond high school graduation and mostly low paying jobs. I did manage to become self sufficient though, so there‚Äôs that. \n\nAs for using this as a coming out message to friends, relatives, coworkers, I wouldn‚Äôt. It comes off as angry and confrontational. It likely won‚Äôt garner much support, even among those who are accepting of trans people (or at least who don‚Äôt oppose them). I don‚Äôt know your social situation or how you expect the majority of people to react, but I think this would solidify rejection from bigots/ignorant folks and turn off most of the rest. \n\nWhat I think this is, is a cathartic exercise in expressing your anger, grief, and sense of injustices against you. I think it‚Äôs great in that regard and very relatable to those of us in the trans community. \n\nIf your goal is acceptance or at least some measure of respect, I would appeal to (perhaps) personal freedom, the widespread acceptance of gender dysphoria as a diagnosis in the medical and mental health communities, and the scientific basis for being transgender. More and more evidence is showing that it‚Äôs related to physical differences in our bodies and brains in relation to cis people. \n\nWhatever you choose to do, I hope it works in your favor and improves your life. You, like so many of us, have suffered immensely through no fault of your own. I‚Äôm now over 4 years into my transition, which I began at the age of 48. I hope that you will get to experience the joy, affirmation, euphoria, and love that I have been fortunate enough to experience since my coming out in 2020."

What that means is that society has collectively created ideas about what it means to be a ‚Äúman‚Äù or a ‚Äúwoman,‚Äù and these ideas vary across cultures and time. For example, in some cultures, wearing a hijab might signify femininity, while in others, it‚Äôs wearing makeup or dresses.\n\nThe important thing is that, as human beings, we don‚Äôt live in a vacuum. We interact with the world, and how others perceive and treat us has a profound impact on our lives. For me, aligning my outward expression and physical characteristics with my internal sense of self brings a sense of comfort and authenticity. It allows me to interact with the world in a way that feels natural and minimizes the discomfort or hostility that can arise from being perceived in a way that doesn‚Äôt match my identity.\n\nTake your example about cooking and sewing‚Äînot everyone who likes these things identifies as a woman, and that‚Äôs fine. But for me, it‚Äôs not just about the activities I enjoy; it‚Äôs about how I feel at my core and how I want to express myself in the world. Transitioning helps me align my identity with my reality, both internally and in how others perceive me.\n\nAt the end of the day, isn‚Äôt it human to want to feel comfortable in your own skin and live authentically? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm trying to do."

It's not that cold here at all (like it might get down to almost 40f here and there in winter, but today it was 70f lmao), but even so, I'll be wearing shorts and a tee and be barefoot around the house and my mom will be completely shook at the fact that I am not cold.

It was ever so slightly chilly and breezy out, too cold for me to want to sit outside, but absolutely perfect to bring some slight cool air into the room. But I was still a bit too warm tbh. 20 minutes later, from a completely different room in the house, my mom came to the living room begging me to close the window because it was making her so cold. I closed it, but I could not fathom how she could possibly be cold when the house is so warm. The side of the house she stays on during the day is always so warm to me, to the point where just sitting still there makes me start to sweat. If I turn it down by just 2 degrees, my mom will say she's too cold.\n\nYou might be cold, but he might be running extra hot.\n\nAlso how long ago did he have surgery? It might be that certain things are still too hard for him to put on and off, or certain things feel to weird against his skin, if he's used to having the layer of a binder between his skin and his outfit, or something like these. His fashion might change over time as the incisions heal more.\n\nI'd just ask if he's even cold at all first lol, before assuming he needs to be wearing something else entirely. If he's not suffering, then why does it matter what he's wearing? If he is cold though, but says he can't afford a better jacket, well now you know what to get him for the holidays."

I'm someone who will go out in what others deem full jacket weather and be just fine in a t-shirt and shorts with weird thick socks because my feet get cold but the rest of me is fine. I've joked that I must be part frost-giant (and that my Nordic genes are showing surprisingly strongly for how few of them I have lol) because I'm just... Not bothered by the cold the way most people are. It comes with the downside that I overheat too easily (I literally have two bottles of water and a homemade icepack in the freezer because my AC in my bedroom doesn't work right now and I'm \\*too hot\\* in winter, when it's starting to dip into the negatives in celsius, not sure how that translates because I stopped using the objectively worse way of measuring temperatures lol, my room is well-insulated and my laptop produces heat but most people would not be bothered by the temp in my room), and I know this'll only get worse when I go on T. Some people are just... Not bothered by the cold. And your friend is enjoying having a chest he can show off, I went a bit nuts the first time I tried transtape, I know for a fact I'll be going shirtless in the Arctic Circle (literally) when I get my chest fixed. I'm not gonna freeze myself to death but I have no doubt I'll have at least one hypothermia scare (I'll try not to but shit happens, I know myself well enough to know it very much is more likely than not, though I don't think I'll actually get hypothermic), and I know my friends will be worried, but some of us are just built for the cold. (trying posting this again, it didn't go through the first time for some reason at least on my end so sorry if this is posted twice)"

And that I eventually adjusted to at least wearing a coat over my outfits.  That adjustment didn't come from friends teasting, though, I literally was just becoming uncomforably cold and decided that I wanted to survive and be comfy rather that being sexy and showing off my body.  \n\nYour buddy will make the same decision when it becomes important for him.  His body, his safety, his comfort - hell, if he's on T, he probably has more cold tolerance then he used to, so he's probably enjoying the brisk weather like this.  He'll put on more layers if that changes for him.  Survival instincts and all."

Love hot weather, even though I sure live in one of the world's worst countries for that. Now even pre-HRT (the opposite way 'mones), I've happily spent days outdoors abroad in literal 38C/100F heat with quite some humidity, and avoided shade like a prey animal fears shadows while walking around town all day long. Or spending a day bicycling, out on the country roads there was no shade even if you wanted it. Both because I love hot weather, and because it's a tempting jackass thing to do to actively avoid shade like the plague.

I seem to be more bothered by it now on T though, and I want that cozy jacket if it's really really cold. But even in a warm jacket, if you have to be outside in below freezing weather for any amount of time you're still going to get pretty cold, but I used to wait for a good while for the bus after work in evenings in below freezing weather, and even if I had the warm jacket I was still feeling the cold, and my pants were usually not thick enough. Even if I \\*was\\* feeling the cold, I wasn't bothered by it, and actually liked it. The cold is extremely refreshing to me, and it makes me feel alive, and I love it, and I'm trying to leave the warm part of the country I'm living in now as soon as I can once I'm done with school here, and plan to move to places known for being cold lol. I'm also having the same problem with a too hot room, even though it's winter, and nobody else seems to be overheating. I wasn't going to go home to my parents for my whole month long break, was only going to go for about a week, but my room at my new apartment was being SO warm, it was intolerable and made me so grumpy, and I couldn't stop complaining about it to my friends to the point I was even annoying myself lol, so I just came to my parents for the whole month anyway just to avoid my room at my apartment. I moved to that apartment in August, so this is the first winter there. My roommates keep the heater on, but the temperature on the thermostat seems normal looking to me, and the rest of the apartment feels even a tad chilly still with the heater on. But then I go into my room, and it feels sweltering. My ceiling fan was always on it's highest speed all day and night. I was opening my windows at night so that I could just barely be able to sleep. I had to flip which end of the bed my head was at, because the corner my head was usually in was the warmest area of the room for some reason. Before leaving for my parents, I even bought a standing fan...I bought this fan for *winter*. That is absurd lmao."

Your own post is evidence of this as it seems that your applying tone and nuance to things that might not necessarily be ment that way. Not an attack or criticism we all do it. But maybe engaging with those posters to dig deeper into why they ask or post what they do instead of assuming could shed some light on the subject, educate them and other who read it on the proper way to talk about it, that doesn't boil trans people down into their label as trans but opens a larger dialogue as the speak about their partners, in this case as you mentioned, as people like everyone else.

I mean why did they date them in the first place if they were going to avoid conversations aboit their sexual preferences and behaviors etc?\n\nWhat I'm more tired of is so many vent posts from our own community where the OP is straight up oblivious or entitled about the fact we are a minority in a world of cis genders... Yet expect to be treated like royalty regarding their pro nouns and being spoken to softly and like they're a lost puppy... I don't expect anyone to change, nobody is a mind reader as to our pronouns and many people aren't polite, period. \n\nIf I look like a guy, have facial hair shadows but long hair while on HRT, I don't get bothered by such small things. It's more about your self confidence at that point. I get called mister and sometimes miss, It mildly bothers me but the world learns at a slow pace and this country among others has a TON of hateful people. I do believe main stream people should stop using terms that identify males or females though (aka honorifics dating back to the 16th century) , it's unnecessary. \"sir\" or \"madam\" or \"miss\" or \"mister\", are not needed. You could still be polite and approach someone and say \"excuse me...\" or \"hello...\" to start a convo without the use of these words. \n\nI want us all to be accepted, but complaining n making a scene like a child isn't the way. We do it by politely and maturely expressing our concerns and asking others to not use labels or honorifics.\n\nJ"

I educated professionals on how to interact with people like us as they were getting more and more clients/patients that were trans. The goal was to see how best to interact with us as to not upset us. \n\nI grew frustrated on the panel when the questions started to feel like I was some sort of alien species. Had to remind them that we are all human beings just like them. We want to live happily, and affirmed in our identity when we do the same mundane tasks (i.e. grocery shopping) they do.

This is sort of what you‚Äôre getting at when you mention the attacks over silly things (tumblr fights, discourse wars, and the like). There is a difference between *choosing* to be an activist (only to be humbled eventually by seeing one‚Äôs own hubris of missing their own ignorance and to wither from view), versus when circumstances done to a person beyond their own control (e.g., actionable, documented discrimination) calls them into a kind of responsive service of advocacy which others might call ‚Äúactivism‚Äù.\n\nThis is why I never disconnect entirely and I never will ‚Äî well, until I‚Äôm unalive. I‚Äôve had to learn to hang back and to watch others I might have been there for in the past to pick up the mantle (because burnout and also quotidian life). But I always keep my ear peeled and I do come back to fill a vacuum when hindsight‚Äôs horizon isn‚Äôt going back nearly far enough for folks to truly grasp how and why things have arrived to where and how they are today. \n\nI would be delighted to see more community elders re-surface, but I also know many of them have a whole lot invested ‚Äî sunk cost ‚Äî in the stealth life and some may consider themselves ‚Äúover it all‚Äù. (Unfortunately, rapid, retrograde changes in places like the U.S. may have to force their hand in unruly, abrupt, cold ways; I just hope they‚Äôre ready to dig in for what‚Äôs coming.)\n\n*****\n\nEDIT to amend: the third graf started out as a trainwreck; I tidied it up a bit to improve clarity."

They introduced a federal bill to legally define sex at birth. This legislates us from being ourselves anywhere in public if it passes (without harassment and constant discrimination). They're passing a rule in healthcare to allow refusal to treat trans patients for any illness based on belief (they tried in 2020 but couldn't finish before the election). Without legal recognition, we can't change our gender and potentially name. This erases us, as well as our suicide stats since no one changing gender exists. If we can change the name but not gender, we have to out ourselves and be in danger in any ID situation.\n\nThey are partnered with SEGM, Genspect, Heritage, and ADF and have bogus studies ready to publish through NIH that discredit the entirety of gender affirming care, criminalizes our providers as abusers, and targets anyone that supports us to isolate us through DoJ and other agencies.\n\nThat porn thing? They're using it with KOSA to restrict any representation of 'trans ideology' anywhere (this sub will be targeted too). It will be classed as porn and scrubbed from everywhere mainstream if they can. Federal funding is withheld from any hospital or doctors providing care, so even if it's not illegal technically, no one can provide it even privately.\n\nNo teaching in schools of any age. This includes med schools for specialities in gender affirming care. Theres already barely any, this leaves us to pure ignorant bigotry in the system. History gone (we were among the first victims of the Nazis and they did this to and literally burned 100 years worth of advancement, history and knowledge). So, we can't be in public without arrest threats, and have no recourse because institutions will be directed to show prejudice, they want to demonize our care and act like we were abused (which usually means they'll want to 'fix' us) and publishing stuff online without being underground or darkweb will be nigh impossible. Scotus looks like they may shed our Equal Protection under the Constitution next month as well which makes it a field day for legislators. This is what they did in Russia effectively (but terrorists, from my understanding, not groomers and porn as they're branding here). This is non exhaustive but hopefully paints a picture of how genocide can be done by penstroke.\n\nNot saying it's all gonna happen, but they've got full power and were shouting to cheers outside SCOTUS about 'permanently wiping transgender ideology (people) from the face of the Earth.' That guy has the House speaker's ear."

    "comment_body": ">This period in times feels different in our community.\n\nIt does, because it is. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt a swing back to the 1970s, because unlike then (which, alas, I still remember), trans folk were still either mythical (Warhol‚Äôs girls) or novel curiosities during that time (except, ofc, in very isolated places, such as ‚Äúradical‚Äù cis feminists doing things, like the terrorist group The Gorgons threatening Olivia Records, with firearms, for having a trans woman as their house engineer; or, with-hunting another certain trans woman in the Bay Area in 1973).\n\nThe historical rhyme and analogue to this moment is, without contest (and observed by queer and trans historians in that arena), the lead in between 1931 and 1933 in the Third Reich. \n\nThe accelerationism endemic then is underway and rapidly growing prevalent now. \n\nThis time, unlike last, they‚Äôre after trans people, surgically so, by name; then, they were more sledgehammer and less scalpel with their catchall ‚Äúdegenerates‚Äù and ‚Äúsexual inverts‚Äù campaign. Nevertheless, the week of 6‚Äì10 May 1933 at the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft did come, just as it‚Äôs coming in Texas and other kindred jurisdictions now. They‚Äôre starting with the most vulnerable of us and working their way upward as they strengthen their swimming legs of structural subjugation and legal eradication.\n\nCome the 20th next January, they have the might and organized plan to have federal backing. \n\nAnd as with the 1930s, mushy middle folks most concerned with their chequebook, the price of eggs, or investment portfolio (including people who, in that silly rhetorical exercise, would allege they‚Äôd travel back through time ‚Äúto kill baby Hitler‚Äù if presented the opportunity) are rapidly falling in line in that particularly Hannah Arendt/John Stuart Mills kind of way, with ‚Äúthe banality of evil‚Äù joining up with, ‚ÄúThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good [people] to do nothing.‚Äù\n\nUgly shit is going to keep coming and I don‚Äôt know when the storm will let up.\n\n>By the way, you present your arguments nicely. Good writer.\n\nCheers. I need an editor."

But I was still pre-op and was way too insecure about my male part that really disgusted me.

I literally woke from one of those exact nightmares just a few days ago this last week and could not go back to sleep because that was a terror that I could not handle.\n\nI literally lived over a decade as a pre-op in celibacy because I was too insecure about being pre-op to date anyone.  Now as a post op I am really open to dating and hope to find a boyfriend for my spouse and I to share.

I have done inpatient and outpatient both, I just need to get beyond the fear of the past parts of my body that no longer even exist to torment me.  \n\nEven today in public sometimes I get a little vaginal or pelvic pressure and start to freak out momentarily wondering if my tuck is showing; yet there is nothing to tuck which gets me back to a sigh of relief.  I mean seriously, who else is this fucked up????\n\nI know quite a few non-op and pre-op trans women, I am even married to a pre-op who is totally at peace with themselves, even as they try to get GRS.

I felt that I really proved that point with my comparison of pre-op anxiety versus post-op confidence.  I felt that I really proved that with my comparison of being a parent responsible for the life of a child, and then again as a grandparent.\n\nWe are not less valuable based on our age or extent of transition.  That is a fact.  \n\nDoes my great granddaughter have the same experience or perspective as me?  Of course not.  \n\nIs my great granddaughter less valuable than me?  Of course not.  I consider my great granddaughter to be more valuable than me.  I would take a bullet for her; I would defend her with my life.  \n\nI replied to Island\\_Bimbo-Bunni the same way that I would to my great granddaughter by teaching her about how her life will evolve and change to prepare her for these things.  I said that it will be fine and they will discover that they are more powerful than they realize and when they look back on their lives they will be amazed at what they have accomplished.\n\nIf it is offensive or rude to share a lifetime of experience; then you will never like what I write and that is your prerogative.   \n\nMy purpose is to assist the younger generation by sharing what I know.  If you do not want or appreciate that, that is your choice.   I will continue to share what I have  experienced because 1.  Others will be receptive.  2. Even the unreceptive (like you) will have seeds of experience planted that may help you in the future.  It is like school.  Even the boring classes that we had no interest in & did not pay attention to still help us later in life.\n\nIf you can do better, by all means do so.  The more voices and perspectives that we hear, the better.  We as a community all need to hear your views too.  You will inspire responses like mine here.\n\nAbout being concise?  When it seems appropriate I will be.  When it does not, I wont.   I choose how much that I have to say about a topic.  \n\nI rehashed the thread as I will choose to do when it suits me.  If that is rude to you; then that is your perception.  I did that to show what has transpired so that you will understand what we are talking about here in case you missed some of it by skimming.  I added some new commentary to try to explain it differently by using my great granddaughter as the example. \n\n I am doing everything that I can to create understanding.  Different explanations; different  examples, which is why it is TLDR for you.  I go above and beyond to convey my experience which is above and beyond a half century.  Discard it or use it as it suits you.  Take what you can use, ignore what you cannot.  These are seeds of information that your memory will store and may help you down the road at some point. \n\nIt takes time, effort & energy to create these words.  I gave some of my life to create them.  That time & life I can never recover.  What words are is ourselves shared with others.  This was effort that could have been used in my book, or working on the house instead given to you where you are offended by it and consider me rude for writing it."

There's a line between Fetish and Preference. \n\nMany straight women *prefer* men of various shapes, but that's not a fetish. You (and I) have a Preference for women of various shapes, be they natural or otherwise we have a preference. \n\nIt becomes a Fetish when you specifically seek someone out SOLELY BASED on that sexual preference. \n\nAs a lesbian you probably see hundreds of gorgeous women a week and go about your day, you're fetishizing when you specifically seek out trans women or AMAB bodies and make that the entire focus of your intention and interaction. \n\nIt's healthy check yourself often here I think. It's easy to slip in the moment and say something that might be hurtful to your partner when you had no ill intentions, what we might find incredibly attractive and the most beautiful sight we've ever seen is someone else's biggest insecurity. This goes far beyond this specific scenario, there's gorgeous full figured women I would worship every inch of laying extreme detail to the soft spots and rolls - because I am *highly attracted* to that body type, however I also understand that many people with that body type are very sensitive and insecure about their body so it's very healthy and wise to check in with your partner and yourself often around these Preferences *before* they become Fetishes"

So I don't think you should go into it with the expectation of her using her bits like that unless she's said something about it, generally you should communicate before sex about it. She might wanna use the strap on you anyways, I know it's possible. Generally you should just have a respectful conversation about anatomy and any other concerns, even if it's breif, before sex with a trans person. Also, as a trans guy who's done a lot of research on trans anatomy both ways, in many circumstances of long term e use the trans girl's bits without operation tend to work much more like an enlarged clit, with some small differences mostly just the urethral placement. \n\nI promise I'm not a creep/chaser, I have an interest in the medical science of trans people, and I'm a trans guy myself."

IF you are attracted to trans women SOLELY for sexual reasons because you're turned on by the aesthetic of a woman with a dick, that's a fetish and we are not objects (just like any other woman or person). I know a strap-on isn't the same, but it gets the job done, right? If you're interested in a trans woman as a person and also love the fact that she has a dick as a \"bonus\" and/or would be into her whether she had a dick or not, I think that's fine. But also, of course, most trans women don't want their dick and feel uncomfortable with it existing. So the individual trans woman's OWN feelings and dysphoria should be taken into consideration (which you can and should ask about).\n\nFor example, I currently have minimal bottom dysphoria and am still primarily attracted to women (cis and trans), so if you were into me and liked that I have a dick, it would be ok. I'm also personally open to NSA stuff, so in my case even if it's just mutual sexual gratification, that's fine (we're helping each other rather than one using the other despite expectations). But if I were super uncomfortable with my dick, then you liking it would likely make me feel even greater dysphoria and maybe like I was being used to some extent. But I can't speak for all my sisters. That's just how I see it. Ultimately, just like with any group, as long as you communicate your intentions clearly and treat us as people first and foremost, you're fine üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nEdit: I would also add that you legitimately seeing us as girls (being a lesbian and all) and not just men in dresses or something else entirely is hugely validating, at least in my eyes."

After the 2nd time and first time with her on top in missionary position, I asked her how it made her feel or if her got anything out of it. Her response was \"OH YEAH\" this wasn't even one that had anything on her side of the strap to stimulate her. She said she felt empowered and to see how much I was enjoying it made her get more excited. \n\nShe had imagined herself with a strap and topping me during her shower masterbation sessions, it gets her going. \n\nIt's a strange place to be really enjoying being penitrated but being almost repulsed by the male body. I guess now I more understand what one of my ex girlfriends who is now a lesbian was talking about when she said to me that all she needed was a beautiful girl with a big strap. That's me, need a beautiful girl with a detachable penis or a trans woman who likes and uses their OEM equipment."

There was no coming back from that. This can be the limit of what you're willing to put up with. Just because she's trans and struggling with dysphoria doesn't mean she can just put down your struggles and insinuate that your problems are \"good things\". I have PCOS too and it was hell come to earth. I recently got a hysterectomy (including ovaries) and my quality of life has improved dramatically. She is wrong to tell you your problems are invalid. You're allowed to have your own struggles. You should be able to complain about these things to someone you consider a close friend. I'm so sorry your friend has been so insensitive to you when it seems that you have always been sensitive to her problems."

The \"Well, at least you have [thing]!\" comment is seen as extremely bad manners in the trans community, no matter how much someone is struggling.\n\nI read your other comments, and this unfortunately sounds like it's developed into a toxic friendship. It's okay to fall back on friends when you're going through a rough patch, but it's *not* okay to make your mental health their responsibility. And it sounds like that's what she's doing. Feeling like you have to walk on eggshells around someone in fear of their response is *the* sign of an unhealthy friendship. It's not good for her, as it sounds like she's growing very dependent, it's not good for you, since you keep having your own feelings dismissed, and it's not good for the friendship, as some kind of resentment will build and fester in the background if this keeps happening.\n\nThe apology bombing without things actually changing is another toxic sign. You could sit down and have a talk with her about the way you're feeling, but there's also a large chance that things won't get better. For your own mental health's sake I'd suggest taking a step back, for at least a little while: it feels like you're trying to take her whole mental health on your shoulders, and that's just not sustainable. If you're concerned that she might actively do something to harm yourself, get in touch with the appropriate authorities: that's way above your pay grade for you to handle."

You're in pain and she made it about herself. \n\nAt the same time, it sounds like she's in a very bad place, especially if she's normally more considerate. The trans condition can be defined by lack, especially during a societal backlash where what little we have is being taken from us and the rift that separates us from cis people is being deliberately widened, and if she's talking about her mother 'deserving to be scarred' by her death, it sounds like her other relationships may be falling apart under the pressure of minority stress. She's obviously in pretty serious pain, too. \n\nBut she's letting her pain divide her from her friend. \n\nRealistically, the solution she needs is to remember the solidarity that I'm sure is core to your friendship. In a society that really cared about women's health and equality, your PCOS symptoms would probably be a lot better managed because we'd have way more medical investment in early detection and treatment, and she'd have been able to transition younger with far more acceptance. \n\nIf our society put the same amount of resources into women's health research and treatment that it does into killing people and repressing women, then by now, you'd probably *both* have perfectly healthy ovaries. This is fundamentally a shared struggle; she needs to remember that your pain can bring you together and that you can face the future in solidarity. \n\nCis and trans women need each other; our fates are intertwined, which is why our enemies are working so hard to divide trans and cis women and conquer us separately."

Having at least testo, DHT, estradiol and SHBG tested may be recommendable. [Here](http://www.hemingways.org/GIDinfo/hrt_ref.htm) were some references.\n\nDiscussing Bicalutamide may be an option in case, it blocks receptors of t and DHT. Some people use a pill every few days, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/i45udz/criticism_of_my_dht_mutant_theory_and_a_way_i/) may be more, and [here](https://transfemscience.org/articles/bica-adoption/#concerns-about-bicalutamide-limiting-its-use) was an article that could be discussed in case.\n\nIt can have effects on a developing fetus so using effective birth control in case would be necessary.\n\nAnd discussing bioidentical progesterone may also be an option, some people said they had fewer pain in general. Its available as pills and cis people usually use it for a few days of their cycle. It can be metabolised to a number of substances including androgenic ones but metabolisation can be individual so it may be necessary to try. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/hormones/transfeminine/index#wiki_bioidentical_progesterone) may be more.\n\nAnd concerning your friend she may have dysphoria concerning cis people ... basically she would like some features of the bodies of cis people and may not be fully aware of issues like pain etc. She may have an idealized version in her head. [Here](https://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Nonviolent-Communication) might be a communication strategy that could help being better understood in case.\n\n\n*hugs*"

That isn't good attention, it's scary and upsetting.\n\nI do understand that she probably associates these things with being a woman, and she wants to experience things that women commonly experience, but her comments are incredibly dismissive of your pain, which isn't something a friend should be doing"

As someone with PCOS myself, I know well how painful it is and why you'd say that, but still. Even so, while shes justified to be in pain and dysphoric, where she went wrong was taking that out on you. I've definitely had similar thoughts around cis men but those are thoughts I keep to myself, because thats not something they control and its not their fault I was born without. The amount of trans women in the comments trying to justify how she treated you is insane to me. Dysphoria should never be something you weaponize to use against another person."

Even when rationally you know you need to prioritize your own mental health, it's so difficult to let that responsibility go. People like these make it feel like there's just no possible way to win: the only way that you're 'good support' in their eyes is if they're your absolute number one priority, even when you have to sacrifice yourself for it. And it always feels like there's never gonna be any end to it, too: once they've found that crutch (in you), they're not gonna be inclined to find any other ways to get better. Therapy? Exploring new coping methods on their own? Finding a fulfilling network outside of that one friend? They always have a reason why those aren't options. After all, it's so much easier to just keep hanging onto that one person who they know will be there for them anyway.\n\nI've been on both sides of the dynamic, so I know it all too well :')\n\nThere is, unfortunately, no ideal way out of these situations. There's not gonna be a 'perfect' solution, and that hurts. Often, like with the note and plans, there's only a solution that's just *the least bad* for everyone involved: doing your task to keep her safe by informing the authorities, while leaving the financial and emotional fallout for what it is (AKA, her responsibility). There will be consequences, yes, but untangling yourself from this sticky of a web will never *not* have consequences: all you can do is control the damage.\n\nI really hope that the internship will give you the distance you need.

Yes, they were extremely nice to us and pleasant *most* of the time. But they got pretty nasty and invalidating when they felt like we were 'being selfish' i.e. prioritising our own well beings even a little bit. It may be worth taking a step back and ensuring you're not accidentally going down the same path we did."

Any condition is going to make things more difficult, but being trans is objectively more stigmatized. Not only do trans people have higher suicide rates, but more importantly, *no one has ever been murdered for having PCOS* let alone been completely barred from entering entire countries. No country will put you to death for having PCOS.\n\nIt's not very helpful to argue all day and night over who has it worse, but acting as if everyone struggles an equal amount is just absurd. PCOS to gender dysphoria is like astigmatism to schizophrenia."

I love the girl to death, but I feel like any time I say that something she said upset me (even if it‚Äôs unrelated to trans stuff) I get apology bombed and then the issue manifests itself over and over again. She has been going through it mentally separately from me which might also be the issue, and I am continually urging her to get professional help with mental health stuff (most recently it was today trying to help her find an IOPP)\n\nPlease see my other comment. This is extremely unhealthy behaviour, and no matter how justified her distress is, it doesn't justify her invalidating your experience. And *crucially*, if she continues this behaviour in a pattern - being mean, apologising profusely, and then doing it again in relatively short order - then it sounds like you two have a unhealthy relationship dynamic. When you put this in terms of a romantic relationship it would be seen as quite unhealthy and worthy of couples therapy.\n\nEdit: And it gets worse if she's refusing to seek help. I assume from your comment, and the way she expresses herself, that if she were totally unable to afford help she'd have let you know in short order. So you comment suggests that she's avoiding getting help even for her immediate problems, let alone how she treats others. That's quite concerning tbh."

I'm convinced I was born that way, because there's simply no other explanation for the gender/sex dysphoria I've always felt. It was never about stereotypes or frivilous things like clothes for me. But I could never really hide my true nature, which is why I suffered abuse from early on in my life.\n\nBeing granted male privilege is very much dependant on being able to successfully assimilate as such in our society. If you are unwilling or unable to do that, that privilege will be denied to you. I always felt I was treated as inferior compared to the male members of my family who were a similar age to me. Who I was on the inside was always on display on the surface, even if I wasn't bluntly telling people about my dysphoria. And I paid a very heavy price for that, and I've been paying it ever since."

Generally speaking, I don't think it's right to assume trans women do gender affirming things because they're trying to be *cis* specifically (although, everyone's internal framework for their goals are different). It's because they're *also women,* and live in a society with certain expectations of women that cis women also experience. When cis women deviate from those same expectations, many also are uncomfortable and struggle with their femininity being questioned. You don't tell them \"well, it doesn't make you trans to have leg hair.\" That's not typically their issue. So, I don't think it's always a comfort just to say \"well it's not only trans women who have leg hair.\" That's not necessarily the issue either."

Theres nothing wrong with that, and thats not you saying anything about if its okay for cis women to have body hair or not. It's about your happiness cuz its your body.\n\nSo I say even if it is normal for women to have body hair, if you want it gone, if it makes you happy to not have it, go for it.

It's not like being body positive means you are anti-working out for example. It's more about not shaming people for certain aspects about their body.  Because it can be pretty difficult to detangle making changes to your body for personal aesthetic purposes versus societal expectation."

I get the vibe from your post that you are not super familiar with the LGBT community, which is totally understandable. These things definitely occur and LGBT folks definitely exist in small towns and cities, but in low population areas it‚Äôs a lot harder to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù since there can be a threat of more backlash with insular communities. \n\nThat said, another commenter mentioned that you are very likely one of the few people they have told this to, in which case they are choosing to be remarkably vulnerable with you. Based on the post it sounds like they tend to speak more when they‚Äôre drunk, and maybe they only find the courage to get the words out when they are. \n\nI‚Äôd encourage you to sleep on it, then reach out in the morning when you‚Äôre both sober. Based on your post you could approach the conversation with something like ‚Äúhey, I wanted to talk to you about last night. I just wanted to let you know that I am here to support you no matter what. I‚Äôm having some trouble wrapping my head around this new information but I‚Äôm hoping you can help me understand what you‚Äôre going through.‚Äù \n\nAs for what you can do after that: be there for your friend and do your own research. I do think it‚Äôs important that you ask them what name and pronouns they prefer to use. That might not be something you‚Äôre ready for yet, but I would ask that you try. I‚Äôm sure this is something they would greatly appreciate. \n\nI do think that recommending they see a therapist would be helpful, but you definitely don‚Äôt want to be pushy. Tell them you want to help but you‚Äôre not a professional, you‚Äôre not a therapist, and you didn‚Äôt go to school for this. It‚Äôs unrealistic for you to try to assume that mantle when it‚Äôs not your place. If you suggest it then let them know that you can help them find a gender affirming therapist, and just help where you can. My advice would be to play support, but ultimately it‚Äôs their journey. \n\nAnd for the self-harm‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs tricky, obviously you‚Äôre worried and there‚Äôs probably a lot of factors at play. They are clearly hurting and you want to help, and I think just them coming out to you has maybe pushed them to a really tough point since they didn‚Äôt know how you‚Äôd react. It took me years to come out to my parents and it was an extremely heavy burden to live with. They probably don‚Äôt know what their support system looks like, but you clearly want to help, so let them know. \n\nI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre expecting you to be an ally overnight, but you‚Äôre in a good place here. Feel free to ask us whatever you‚Äôd like. I know a lot of people in this community wish that their coming-out had more people like you: maybe confused, maybe misunderstood, but ultimately with a lot of care and love."

I would recommend the gender dysphoria bible. \n\nhttps://genderdysphoria.fyi/en\n\nIt‚Äôs available in multiple languages and understanding or at least trying to is an awesome step you can take.

It's clear that your friend really means a lot to you and I hope you will recognize that trans people are just people and coming out is really fucking hard.\n\nSo that's the next point. You see a guy getting shit faced and telling secrets. I see a trans woman struggling to get the words out and using alcohol to do it. Telling the closest people in your life that you're trans is incredibly tough. As much as you think you know them, you're dropping a bomb in the relationship and begging them not to pull the pin. So many people are just weirded out and can't continue being friends. So many people have this latent religious dogma in their head that tells them to reject someone they cared about. So I hope you will continue to be the friend you have been.\n\nIt does sound like your friend suffers a lot from depression, and you are right to recommend a therapist. I hope that works out. Finding a therapist is actually surprisingly hard. It's not a great situation, given that when people need therapists they tend not to be super stable and ready to take on big projects. Anyway, I hope that works out.\n\nAnyway, good luck to both of you. Hugs."

    "comment_body": "Hey OP - you've already gotten a fair bit of advice, so I'll try not to repeat what everyone has been saying.\n\nFirst off, thank you for trying to do right by your friend. I understand this is kind of a pretty world-changing thing to run into and you've probably got a lot to think about a deal with now. Your discomfort with the bisexuality reveal makes sense - a lot of the world sort of treats bisexuality or male people attracted to men as somehow weird or gross, and even when you don't usually feel particularly strongly about it, having it show up in your friends can be uncomfortable Because of all that societal stuff out there. I imagine you have some amount of similar discomfort around your friend's transness, for Basically the Same Reasons. The world is not kind to us, and especially not to trans women.\n\nYou may be \"the wrong guy\" in the sense that you're not prepared at all. That's okay. Everybody had to start somewhere, including us trans people, and everybody starts from whatever point they're at. You're the right guy in the sense that you Already love your friend and want the best for her, even if you don't entirely understand what it entails. Transition and realizing one's identity is a scary and destabilizing process, and it's very important to have long-time friends who know you and support you along for the ride.\n\nTell your friend that you meant it when you said you would support her (and really, sincerely mean it). Find resources to learn more about transness and what it's really like, so you can be a little more educated (and hopefully less scared and worried). I don't know what your first language is, but Cassie LaBelle has some essays on her medium webpage about \"help my friend just came out as transgender what do i do now\", and those might be a useful read for you. A lot of stuff is gonna be a little weird and off-kilter for a while - that's okay. You'll eventually learn more and get used to your friend's situation, and it will become more normal over time. You're not the first nor the last person to have to do something like this (same way your friend is not the first nor last trans woman to have to figure out her life and transition). I hope you can find other people you can privately discuss things with \\*without outing your friend to people in your community\\*. It will be important to have places to take your confusion and anxiety without burdening your friend, or endangering her by letting slip to people who know her. This subreddit is a good option, but also certain queer organizations may provide an avenue too. The US has PFLAG, which is specifically for parents and family members of queer/trans folks. You may be able to locate a similar group where you are. Good luck OP - the road ahead is going to stretch your capacity for love and tolerance, but I trust that you care deeply about your friend and want to do the right thing."

Just being there for your friend, someone they can talk to about issues and such would improve your friends mood and generally help them mentally. (considering you said your friend admitted doing sh)\n\n  \nNow to explain a bit about the whole trans thing, it means that your assigned gender at birth doesn't match the way one would experience their gender identity internally. This usually (not all of the times thought) causes gender dysphoria aka a feeling of unease, distress about their looks. Being trans however isn't about the dysphoria, but it's like \"would you be happier if you looked like your preferred gender\". Considering your friend being seemingly in distress they do probably experience dysphoria though. \n\nIf you wanna take higher action in helping your friend though I'd say it wouldn't be a bad idea to get some gifts that could help battle the dysphoria, could be some simple women's clothing (you can't go wrong with an oversized hoodie for example), or straight up ask your friend if there's anything you could get that would make them feel better."

My family has not been even remotely supportive or tolerant since I came out this past summer, but they keep trying to gaslight me into thinking that I am the one pulling away rather than them, and I have had enough. The election sent me over the edge, too, as it became readily apparent that they prioritized themselves, their religion, and their politics over their own family. I feel completely frozen out despite them trying to tell me it's my fault, and the election really allowed me to see this for what it is.\n\nPeople can have their reasons for voting, that's not what hurts.

Lets think about this for a second. If your plan was to be a danger to women I don't think the sign on the door was going to stop you. When I go the womens washroom/locker/etc I am literally like any other person awkwardly rushing to be in and out and do not care for strangers knowing that I have to pee at all.\n3. There is no credible evidence for this.

(increase of breast cancer risk, etc.)\n4. There is nobody being peer presured into being trans. Transition has its positive moments and there is a certain siblinghood with your fellow trans folk but most of us wouldn't wish this on anybody. The lows are very very low and half of people hate you by default.\n\n5)You are correct, the vast majority of case of regret come from people losing their entire families and communities just for being themselves.

They might have stolen the word but they don't embody they spirit of it.\n\n7) There are spaces and support groups for parents of trans/queer children, there are similar spaces for spouses of trans folk. They do have valid reasons to exist, transition can be a lot and our emotional turmoil from the realities of transition doesn't just affect us. Its like any other hard thing we humans can go through. You don't choose to be trans any more than any other thing in life.\n\nThere is a lot of anti-trans rhetoric happening right now.

I transitioned medically as a minor and it saved my life. A lot of people don‚Äôt understand how debilitating and harmful it is to not have access to medical treatment as a trans minor. It kills kids. It was really painful living my teen years knowing that people who don‚Äôt even know me or anything about me are able to make such critical decisions about my health. Cis kids are allowed to receive basically any other medically necessary treatment regardless of it being a big decision, because it would be harmful to withhold medical care just because a kid may not fully understand it (however, teenagers aren‚Äôt stupid. They understand the effects of medication). That would rightly be seen as cruelty, but since trans kids are so politicized it gets ignored when we‚Äôre the ones suffering. Please take the time to read stories from trans kids (not just their parents, but trans kids, many of whom are now trans adults who have written books and blogs) and understand how important this issue is to us.

For one example, if a trans boy gets on puberty blockers early enough, they won't need to seek a mastectomy later in life. Puberty blockers give people time to make decisions, and are safe to stop taking at any time to resume puberty.\n2. There is so much wrong with this, but I think maybe the best thing to point out is how anti-trans policies lead to masculine women getting assaulted and harrassed out of bathrooms way more than it affects trans people. There are some news stories you can look up to help with that point.\n3. There aren't really any long term health risks associated with transitioning. There are studies out there, but results kinda depend on what you choose as your control group. For example:\n   * [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589936822000111](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589936822000111)\n   * \"Overall, the available data indicate that transgender women on GAHT are at a higher risk of ischemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction) compared with sex assigned at birth women, however transgender women appear to have similar cardiovascular risk when compared to sex assigned at birth men.\"\n   * Additionally, there isn't really one single method of transitioning. For example, there are different drugs, and different routes of administration. Pills can be associated with higher risk of blood clotting, but these days doctors are smart enough to only prescribe those to people with other good vital signs to reduce the risk, so it really isn't a problem.\n   * That bone stuff sounds very weird though. Is she somehow getting trans women mixed up with post-menopausal women? It would probably be worth calling that out.\n   * As per this review, there are mild improvements to bone health: \"Estrogen therapy has a positive correlation with trabecular bone score and bone mineral density in the lumbar region of transgender women but not elsewhere\"\n4. I have yet to see any evidence of that, but keep in mind anecdotes aren't statistics. Queer kids tend to group together for hopefully obvious reasons, so it's easy to get the wrong impression if you expect perfectly evenly distributed kids.\n5. This comes from the mistaken idea that the alternative to transitioning is being 'normal'. It's not. The alternative is heavy depression, suicidality, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse issues. Transitioning isn't about making life perfect, it's about making like better, which countless studies have shown it succeeds at.\n6. Judith Butler I hear is a good author. You could also ask her why TERF groups keep siding with anti-feminist anti-abortion religious fundamentalist groups if they're so feminist [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands\\_Across\\_the\\_Aisle\\_Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_Across_the_Aisle_Coalition)\n\nI hope this helps, but honestly you should try sharing wholesome positive stories of trans people transtioning. Cold hard facts are one thing, but it might help more than anything else to remind her that trans people are human too, with stories and needs and feelings just like her. Best of luck."

    "comment_body": "1.) You should NOT be forming such a strong opinion if you do not have an inkling of the scientific reasoning behind it. \n\nThat said. I take 2 approaches. \nOne. Puberty blocker is safe an reversible. Flat out. It has been a thing for cisgender kids for way longer for a reason. Because puberty blocker is there to buy time or to prevent WORSE THINGS from happening than 'bone density'.\n\nWhen people say puberty blocker is dangerous, they mostly point to bone density. There's a very simple solution for kids who have weaker bones. Calcium and proper nutrition. That is it.\n\nTwo. People against transitional blockers argue that cisgender kids NEED it unlike trans kids due to precocious puberty.\n\nThe main reason we try to prevent precocious puberty is due to societal and in turn, personal damage early puberty could do.\n\nPoint in case, blockers are typically given to cis girls who are developing too fast to prevent increase in rape, bullying, and stigma- and in turn, worse mental health. \n\nTrans kids should not be discriminated against when the reasons are similar. Mental and overall well being of a child.\n\n\nNow try to make an argument agaisnt cis kids getting in blockers. \n\n\n2.) This just does not happen. There's a reason why the right wing producer Matt Walsh had to pivot with the movie Lady Ballers.\n\nBecause unlike this narative that has been formed, trans women just want to live. \n\nAlso, it's easier to encroach on women's spaces as a cisgender male. \n\n\n\n3.) And 5.)\n\nLike with anything medical, there's going to be some risks involved. But this is why MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. came to a concensus that transitioning for gender dysphoria is the best solution. Because they tried other avenues and they were not as effective.\n\nAs for regret. HRT and transitioning is considered medical miracle due to the low percentage of regret rate. More people regret surviving due to getting a heart transplant than transitioning.\n\n\n4.) As for peer pressure. Bigots call it peer pressure, others call it visibility. \n\nWhy shouldnt kids be able to explore themselves including gender? If they figure out later that uts not for them, they can detransition.\n\nThats why we have puberty blockers and thats why the first step is social transitioning. To try it out.\n\n\n6.) Your mom doesnt sound like she knows her feminism.\n\nIn US specifically, trans women were included since the 2nd wave feminism. Because even back then, people realized that excluding trans folks conceded a lot of points of feminism to cis men. \n\nPoint being Imane Kaliff. Do you really want to be discriminated against and looked down by society as a woman because you happen to look a tad more masculine? It's a dangerous slippery slope of bigotry, transphobia, misogyny, and racism.\n\n\n7.)\n\nFrankly do not care. \n\nImaging being trans in current day sociopolitics. Thats more traumatizing than having a kid turn out queer. \n\n\n\nTo me. Your mom is not logical. She fell for propaganda that goes against everything medical professionals have been saying for the last couple decade."

    "comment_body": "Thank you for coming here to ask for help, and seeing this nonsense for what it is. I‚Äôm going to speak to just the first point about kids on blockers and hormones, since I‚Äôm a parent of trans kinds. Surgery on trans kids is largely bogeyman nonsense, except for rare top surgery. And if people aren‚Äôt up in arms about breast implants and rhinoplasty for rich cis girls then we can put that one aside as transphobia altogether. \n\nBlockers are temporary, reversible, *pauses* on puberty. Cis and trans kids use them safely, for different reasons (precocious puberty versus giving kids time to understand puberty ramifications and make an informed choice about pursuing male or female hormones.) \n\nTrans kids largely start to understand their real gender either around age 2-4 (when they are able to start expressing preferences for clothes and toys and feel confused or frustrated by parental insistence on the trappings of their assigned-at-birth gender) or puberty (when panic hits because their body is changing in ways they realize they hate/feels fundamentally wrong.) For anyone who has been a parent, no woke parents are pushing kids to be trans and getting them onto hormones. We see how cruel the world is to trans people. We support our kids in their gender precisely because the alternative of living the wrong gender is actually WORSE. Also, as parents, I‚Äôve never been successful in forcing my kids to play X sport or wear X outfit for an event if it felt uncomfortable or even leave the house for a non-preferred activity without a fight. Kids know what they want and know who they are. Can you imagine dressing a cis girl in overalls for years without rebellion if they‚Äôre actually a pink unicorn type kid? They‚Äôd resent you forever and maybe do makeup and change clothes at school. Kids KNOW what they want and who they are, even cis kids. And the incongruity is even worse for trans kids. Listening to the kids you have, and helping THAT kid thrive is key. \n\nBlockers pause puberty for trans kids, following a LOT of conversations and listening and therapy (for kids and maybe parents) and doctors visits and blood draws and general PITA expensive and degrading experiences. We don‚Äôt go into this because we want trans kids, but we want OUR kids to not feel wrong inside and suicidal and self-hating and depressed.\n\nAnd the very critical reason that hormones should be blocked early and then kids should start cross-sex hormones in teen years is because puberty is irrevocable. My kids are on track to be 6‚Äô3‚Äù broad-shouldered, hairy men. Except they‚Äôre girls. And I can fully stop the irreversible trauma of them having hairy faces/bodies, broad shoulders, deep voices, etc and just looking like the women they actually are. They‚Äôve told me who they are for 7 years now, never wavering. Blockers and teen hormones can halt some of the discrimination directed towards them from transphobia and halt all the gender-based self-hatred that would come from the living in the wrong body. Or at least, I can do that In dwindlingly few places right now. And I might be arrested or have my kids taken from me if i try to help them be the best version of themselves. It‚Äôs a panic that hangs over my head every day right now. \n\nAnd as for losing the ability to have biological kids, who cares?! Lots of cis people can‚Äôt have kids. Infertility is real for many many people. Childless by choice is real. Adoption is real. Gay marriage and surrogacy with the bio inputs from just one partner is real. There are zero guarantees in life and the maybe of biological kids shouldn‚Äôt decide your intrinsic, cellular-level happiness with yourself (or you might end up being a shitty sad parent when trapped in the wrong life anyhow.) Plus this focus on baby making is gross and regressive and part of the oligarchic push for wage slaves who fight among themselves so they don‚Äôt have enough power to resist. \n\nOthers can answer your other questions here, but I just wanted to chime in to help you understand more on the nuances for yourself on kids and hormones. I don‚Äôt know if it will resonate with your parents, but I really appreciate you coming here for insight overall."

    "comment_body": ">They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions.\n\nRather defeats the purpose of **puberty blockers**, which have been in use for precocious puberty for decades without serious adverse effects. Also, children under the age of majority DON'T get to \"make this decision\", it's a decision made in concert with their parents and physicians.\n\nAs for medical ramifications, puberty blockers are shown to be safe if used as intended (for a short period of less than two years).\n\n>Trans women in cis female spaces (the classic bathroom/changing room debate). They insist this poses dangers to cis women.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing to support this statistically. Yes, the same arguments were made around lesbians in women's spaces, and also around **black women** in women's spaces. It's ancient repackaged bigotry.\n\n> But they also said that a predatory male could just declare themselves a woman and enter freely.\n\nUntrue, and there's also nothing stopping predatory males from entering bathrooms anyway. A male willing to break the social taboo on social predation isn't going to be stopped by bathroom stigma.\n\n>I also pointed out that trans women would face much higher dangers in cis male spaces, but they simply said 'there are more cis women'. \n\nYour parents have freely admitted they are willing to let a statistical minority suffer sexual and physical assault over a hypothetical fear rooted in no statistical evidence whatsoever. This is a rather startling self-report. USUALLY people with an ounce of moral fiber/self respect will backpedal or prevaricate when presented with the question of \"what are trans women supposed to do\", not just say \"fuck it, there's less of them\".\n\n>Medical dangers of transitioning. Specifically some shit about bones crumbling. Scientific articles I have found dispute this, no idea where that came from. \n\nOsteoporosis can occur in the absence of sex hormones, which is really only a problem if HRT is taken away from a trans person who has already undergone GAS.\n\n>Peer pressure / mis-identifying dissatisfaction. Saying a lot of youth are simply buying into the hype and misplacing typical angst with gender dysphoria.\n\n\"Social contagion\" specifically came from Lisa Littman, who evidenced her theory by polling transphobic parents from explicitly transphobic online communities such as \"transgender trend\". Notably, being gay and bisexual in the early 80's was also called \"a social contagion\". This is, once again, just repackaged bigotry. Further, the term \"contagion\" was chosen deliberately, in an attempt to intuition pump the listener into believing something alarming was going on. Another, less provocative term would be \"idea\". All ideas are \"contagious\", that's literally how the transference of knowledge works. Including their newly discovered, nascent transphobia.\n\n>Regret. \n\nSpecifically and eternally when this subject is raised, they are saying \"I would happily see a million trans children end their lives to save one cis child from potential regret\". Regret is part of life, the regret rate based on current gatekeeping standards is exceptionally low, and they are locking onto lurid outliers that are signal boosted by conservative media because it confirms an implicit bias.\n\n>Looking for literature that examines trans women in feminism.\n\nI would go to r/askfeminists for this.\n\n>A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma.\n\nHaving a trans child is indeed tough for parents, especially during an ongoing moral panic. I have a friend with a trans child and she went through a lot of fear and grief, but she fiercely defends her daughter and would die to protect her rights. I have all the time in the world for parents struggling with this, but very little patience for those that let it fuel bigotry."

The sheer amount of emotional and psychological damage I've had to work through just to get to a point where I'm comfortable coming out to anyone without a screen in front of me is herculean - and that's not counting the arduous task of deciding to start transitioning now, in my mid 30s. \n\nIt's hard not to think about 'what if I could've done this earlier?' 'what if I could've had a voice I was happier with?' 'what if I could've kept more of my hair?' - all of these regrets because I was never given the chance to be myself as a kid.

    "comment_body": "Parent here, so I'll confine myself to the points that are relevant to parenting. \n\n>1. Puberty blockers and pre-adult transitioning. They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions. \n\nWhat they need to understand is that children *aren't* making medical decisions in a vacuum. They are reporting a problem - just like kids do with anything else that's bothering them. And then, just like with any other medical or mental health issue, the parents help them seek care. \n\nThere are a lot of people on the right pushing the idea that schools are somehow \"transing\" other people's kids, implying that they are getting puberty blockers, hormones, and even surgery without parents' consent. *This is 100% false*. Schools can't give so much as a Tylenol without the parents' consent. \n\nWhich brings me to the parents' role. Far from kids making irreversible medical decisions on their own - many parents *block* their minor children from accessing appropriate care, sometimes even basic social transition. Transness is not something most of us expect or immediately understand, and it can be hard to find accurate information. What's worse, over the past 8-10 years, anti-trans activists have been flooding the internet with misleading or completely fabricated \"studies\" to intentionally muddy the waters. \n\n>4. Peer pressure / mis-identifying dissatisfaction... example of 12 students from the same class all wanting to transition. \n\nOne of the \"misleading studies\" I mentioned above was published in 2018 proposing a \"new diagnosis\" called Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD). It described exactly this phenomenon, and proposed that kids \"become trans\" because of a \"social contagion\". The study has been widely criticized for only asking for parent reports, among many other serious flaws. \n\nIt's true that sometimes an entire friend group will \"suddenly\" come out as trans over a short time period. But this phenomenon has been noted for decades among LGBTQ youth. All the gay kids seem to \"find each other\" in school, even before they're consciously aware of what makes them \"different\" from the mainstream or what they themselves have in common. Then over time, they help each other figure it out, and eventually support each other's coming out process. The same thing is still happening, but greater awareness of the whole LGBTQ spectrum - along with access to information via the internet - enables these friend groups to be more accurate and nuanced with their self discoveries than we were back in the day. \n\n>6. Radical feminism. \n\nOk, this one isn't about parenting but I am a feminist too. The thing is, once you fully accept the idea that trans women are women, all of the apparent tension between feminism and transness falls away. Feminism is about what we have traditionally labeled \"women's rights\". In actuality, these rights fall into two main categories - sex-based rights like abortion, and gender-based rights as a counter to misogynistic social systems. Without going into my whole essay-length spiel, breaking it down this way actually helps feminists examine and analyze oppressive systems in important ways. And the distinction between sex and gender is something that the trans community has brought to light. \n\n>7. A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma. My mom's friend has a trans son and is clearly struggling with it, apparently called it a 'daily trauma'. \n\nYeah, your mom's friend is causing her own trama. Sometimes kids don't turn out the way we expected, and far too many parents can't cope with that. The son has merely accepted and embraced something about himself that conflicts with his mom's beliefs or worldview. People used to have these kinds of reactions to their kids coming out as gay too, and some still do today. Does that mean it was wrong of those kids to come out? Should they have remained closeted to keep their parents comfortable? Would that have made them straight if they pretended long enough? I doubt your parents would say so given your overall description of them. So why should a young man keep pretending to be a daughter for his parents' comfort? \n\nBeing gay and being trans are different things, but they are treated in very similar ways by cishet society (hence the reason they are both included in the rainbow). They are both inherent traits that challenge our assumptions about human gender and sexuality. If your parents have successfully deconstructed their beliefs about one, they can use a similar process to deconstruct their beliefs about the other.\n\nIt would greatly benefit your mom's friend to actually connect with parents who are accepting. If she's on Reddit, r/cisparenttranskid is excellent. There are also groups on Facebook (Mama Bears, Mama Dragons, Serendipitydodah). And many local LGBTQ resource centers run support groups for loved ones of trans individuals. Often it only requires a small shift in perspective. As long as she is wallowing in anti-trans echo chambers or unaccepting peer groups, she's just going to dig herself deeper into her own denial and drive a wedge between herself and her son."

Also imagine if a guy just said \"I'm a trans man I have to use this bathroom\" if we actually had to worry about it, the predators would be doing that right now, but they're not, because they don't need the excuse to force themselves on others, they're breaking the law anyway.\n\n3: see point 1, that's the only thing I can assume they're talking about.\n\n4: We should all cut off our right arms because that'd be so cool and hip, right? Obviously having bottom surgery is nothing like self mutilation but their view is that we would do this for poularity. But I mean really who wouldn't love to be harassed and bullied for the rest of their lives by scum of the earth who hide behind misrepresented statistics to tell people to kill themselves? Being trans is just so easy and fun and has no problematic consequences. Absolutely insane idea. Besides that we also saw the same thing said about left handed people when we didn't bully them out of it.\n\n5: if you're regretting it, it's because your family treated you like shit after. Studies were done on this and the regret rate for SRS is not only lower than regular surgeries like knee surgery, but also mainly caused by being exiled socially, a problem that wouldn't exist if people would just be decent human beings.\n\n6: all trans exclusionary takes are anti feminist takes.  Checking your genitals in the bathroom is not feminist. Treating trans men as confused babies is not feminist. Policing your femininity and looks is not feminist. Abusing women for looking \"too masculine\" is not feminist. And these are all things the transphobes advocate for.\n\nThe final point here is spoilered because it is a very angry rant that is going to have a few insults and a fair bit of swearing\n\n>!7. Fuck their pseudo-psychology \"parental trauma\". Frankly if they can't handle a trans kid they should not have ever had a kid because they were never equipped for even the smallest of obstacles. Being supportive of your kid is not a fucking trauma. How pathetic. We have to actually deal with being trans and they make it about them, as if they would suffer even a fraction of what a trans person does. I frankly cannot entertain this, it is just a case of \"fuck that, shut up\"!<"

    "comment_body": "1. Puberty blockers are 100% reversible, TERFs lie about what they do. They've been used safely for decades to treat precocious puberty. Gender affirming care and transition mean different things at different sges. For pre-pubeacent children, it means therapy and possibly social transition. For early pubescent children it means puberty blockers as well as therapy and social transition. HRT is typically given to later age teenagers when it's clear they are going to need to transition. Children almost never receive surgery. Of the 300 or so gender affirming mastectomies each year, format example, almost all of them are done on cis male children with cynecpnastia. Forcing a person to go through the wrong puberty is cruel and is non-reversible. Imagine forcing a cis child to take HRT at puberty and when they protest telling them they are too young to make that decision themselves.\n \n\n2. You are right, this was actually the same argument used to prevent lesbians from going in women's changing rooms in the past. Also, a man does not need to claim to be trans to go in the ladies room, there's not a guard posted. And if he assaults somebody in there, claiming to be trans won't protect him from the criminal consequences. Sexual assaults don't happen in the bathroom, and when it does it's almost always by cis males, in the men's room, and against cis males or trans people. Most sexual assaults that aren't between intimate partners and family/family frienda are done on the streets and in vehicles. Criminalizing trans women using the bathroom because cis men can't are doing rapes in streets is bonkers. Also, this forces trans men into women's changing rooms and bathrooms. Makes zero sense.\n \n\n3. Transitional medical care is grossly understudied, but most of it confirms it's safety. A study a couple years ago showed that AMAB children who went on puberty blockers had lower bone density than AMAB boys who didn't, but not catastrophically so. If they started estrogen, they'd have the same bone density as cis females and if they desired their bone density would return to normal AMAB levels with time. TERFs have made a lot of hay lying about this, claiming it causes osteoporosis, and some of their conspiracy theories get down right Q-anon-esque.\n \n\n4. There is no evidence for \"rapid onset gender dysphoria.\" There is no huge wave of kids identifying as trans. All that's happening is that children now have the freedom to explore their gender in ways they couldn't before. Some of them end up being trans, many don't. That's why gender affirming care does not start with HRT, why WPATH has guidelines for AGE APPROPRIATE care. The only evidence for ROGD is a \"study\" where the \"researchers\" asked a bunch of transphobic parents from mumsnet how many of their kids friends were trans and they were like, \"All of them!\" It's all nonsense.\n\n \n5. Gender affirming healthcare has a 1% regret rate, among the lowest of all categories of care. There is around a 5% detransition rate, but out of that 5%, almost all of them deteansitioned due to social pressures, not that they aren't actually trans. The number of detransitioners because they no longer feel trans, numbers in, like, the low hundreds, and many of those RE-transition at some point. But TEEFs are always trotting out the few dozen willing to go on the record and blame their doctors or their parents or the government or \"gender ideology\" or other trans people for what they went through. Detransitioners need the support of the community and the same considerations for medical care as anyone else. But banning trans care to protect them is going to hurt a group orders or magnitude larger.\n \n\n6. Your mom is mistaken about what feminism is, probably because she's listening to JK Rowling. Radical feminism doesn't mean advocating for women to the exclusion of others. Imagine saying, \"feminism excludes men because they aren't women.\" Feminism doesn't intrinsically exclude everyone, it advocates for the deconstruction of patriarchal gender norms that oppress women but hurt everyone. TERFs are almost invariably both SWERFs (sex work exclusionary) and \"white feminists.\" That is, not feminists who are white, but feminists who center and prioritize white women's perspective, interests, and grievance. I'll bet if you accuse her of \"white feminism,\" she'll show her true colors pretty fast.\n \n\n7. This one is the Cruz of their problem. I remember in high school in the late '90s, the kid of a prominent member of our community came out as gay. His parent basically disowned him, he became a pariah around town, and all I heard from the adults around me was, \"Oh his poor parents. How could he do this to them? How could he be so cruel? He clearly just wants to hurt them.\" For a lot of parents, the greatest fear a parent has is their kid not turning out how they imagined. To them, the child's struggles are actually the parent's shame. This is narcism, it centers the feelings of a parent in their child's life, and anybody who would do that is a real POS."

Despite your impression of your parents as open minded, tolerant hippies, they seem to be showing the signs of intolerance and transphobia. All of the points you brought up suggest that they engaged in anti trans bias during their investigation of the issue. It looks like they went into it with the express purpose of being able to criticize, vilify, and dismiss the trans community. \n\nI think your parents either have a tendency towards transphobia, or they have been strongly affected by anti trans propaganda. Hundreds of millions were spent during the last US election to invalidate and dehumanize us. Unfortunately, propaganda works all too well. \n\nI applaud your desire to help your parents see reason when it comes to the trans community, but my gut feeling is that your attempts to educate them are going to end up being very frustrating for you. The hard truth is that people are swayed much more by emotion than by logical argument. That‚Äôs why the anti trans movement doesn‚Äôt rely on facts, but on disgust, fear, and outrage. They use the same factually disproven tropes over and over again because they still sway people with their emotional appeal. \n\nSadly, I suspect the only thing that might change how your parents think on the issue is having someone close to them come out as trans, and see how much they suffer from the attitudes of our society. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to deter you from trying to change your parents‚Äô minds, I think it‚Äôs a worthy endeavor. A lot of redditors here have come up with some great information and arguments for you. I just don‚Äôt want you to feel defeated if you can‚Äôt bring them around. That said, I wish you success."

    "comment_body": "1. The problem is most (very high %) of people with Gender Dysphoria do not \"grow out of it\". Puberty makes permanent changes to one's body, often causing extreme distress in people with Gender Dysphoria. It is cruel to make them go through those permanently altering changes, making it more medically risky and expensive to change later, if even possible. Just delaying it until they have a chance to make a choice is the kind thing to do. It is also very low risk on the medicines if not done for a very long time, as long as they are monitored and at the right doses.\n2. I usually like to ask what they would support, because it almost always includes forcing trans men into women's spaces which makes women 10x less safe. Trans women are not the issue, cis/straight men are the problem. If they want to force there way in they could now. Keeping trans women out of the spaces they feel comfortable in is not making it less safe for women at all.\n3. Transitioning can mean a lot of things. Most of the time things like that come from taking information out of context. For example, taking Lupron without having added any other hormones can cause a lot of things to go wrong. \n4. Peer pressure happens. There is a small percentage of people in that category, though, and it typically does no persist. Seems to be highest among pubescent girls/trans boys from what I have seen. That group can also get bad advice when counselors are not adjusted to modern social / social media, etc. I have read articles on this but can't find it. I have NOT seen any of those for trans girls.  Note: The anti-trans usually focuses on trans boys and trans women, not trans men or trans girls. Most of it is rooted in misogyny.\n5. Very low % of regret. Surgeries even have one of the lowest % of regret among all surgeries - especially ones like hip or knee replacements. There are hard statistics for this. The numbers I have seen are around 3% or lower and almost always for social reasons. One Australian study who actually followed people (one of the most complete studies) showed less than that.\n6. There is a ton, so I will let others comment here. The core of the issue is the root of the problem, though: They are assuming trans women are men. Usually, men have this issue trying to imagine wanting to be a woman, but they should be imagining having been a man like they are but being born as a female.\n7. Yeah. It can be traumatic. A century ago they may have held a funeral for their old identity to help people move on. It can feel like someone dying to some people. That is normal because they person they thought the other was - the one that they had in their head - was not that person. Death of one's perception can hurt as much as an actual death."

My hope is that I will convince them that their talking points are garbage, thus robbing them of their rational backing and force them to confront their unintentional bigotry. As I mentioned, they were really disturbed by the comparison to the anti-gay rhetoric, which they have been fighting all their lives. So I'm hoping that, without the comfort of rationality, they will at least recognise the flaws of their position. They are not inherently bigoted, they have just been misguided. But that has turned into full-on bigotry, which is what I'm trying to fight."

This is laughably ludicrous as a method of testing a hypothesis.\n\nFurthermore - so what? If the children were really getting puberty blockers were handed out like sweets, maybe it could be a problem, but that simply isn't how it works - it requires the agreement of child, parents and doctors. If children want to have a trans phase that helps them understand themselves better - so what? Who bloody cares?

How do you enforce this?\n\nDo you require genital inspections of everyone using the facility?\n\nDo you require that everyone show their ID cards before using them? If so then what if someone forgets it or doesn't have ID? What about children? Furthermore - many jurisdictions allow changes of gender on ID cards so those trans people would be allowed in.\n\nDo you allow/encourage staff/the-general-public/police to challenge those they believe might be trans? This option leads to a significant uptick in the amount of harassment that butch women (and women otherwise seen as not feminine enough). Also - if a cis woman is challenged - how is she meant to prove her sex?\n\n['I'm a biological woman ‚Äì why am I questioned in the women's toilets?' | News UK | Metro News](https://metro.co.uk/2023/08/08/im-a-biological-woman-why-am-i-questioned-in-the-womens-toilets-19301301/)\n\n[Butch lesbian opens up about ‚Äòincreasing harassment‚Äô she faces when she uses public toilets ‚Äì The i Paper](https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/butch-lesbian-public-toilet-women-abuse-government-review-gender-neutral-facilities-833787)\n\n[Butch Woman Are Facing Transphobia In Public Toilets](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/bathroom-transphobia-butch-women)\n\n[Women are getting harassed in bathrooms because of anti-transgender hysteria | Vox](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/18/11690234/women-bathrooms-harassment)\n\nLastly - what bout intersex people?

But the laws we have already protect from indecent behaviour in public places (including in bathrooms / changing rooms) and more strict restrictions are logistical nightmares that cause further problems and harassment of innocent people.\n\nIt's one of those ideas that sounds good on the surface (stopping predators) if you are already that way inclined, but is impossible to enforce. That is why those who actually have to enforce it (e.g. police) usually stay schtum about it.\n\nPart 2/3"

But I did research, and my gson is on puberty blockers now. If he develops breasts, the gender dysphoria would overwhelm his psyche; gender affirming care keeps people alive. It allows him a few more years to be sure he's male before going on testosterone, something he's already positive he wants to do. In the meantime, he won't develop female physical traits that have to be undone via painful, expensive surgery later.\n\nMost trans people believe they would've had a much easier time with their transition if they hadn't gone through puberty. \n\nI'm inclusive and compassionate, but did worry about children making these decisions. However, what convinced me is this: it makes sense that even a 5-year old knows what gender they are, and are not. Gender is hard-wired in the brain during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, while it's hardwired into the body during the 1st. It's reasonable to assume these don't always match up for whatever reason (could be maternal hormones). In that case, you'd treat it much the same as you would a child born with a birth defect: You fix it."

    "comment_body": ">Puberty blockers and pre-adult transitioning. They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions.\n\nA few things;\n\n1. Depending on the laws of where you live in the world - children under the age of 18 are already allowed to make some medical decisions for themselves. In the UK this is sometimes called Gillick Competence. [Consent to treatment - Children and young people - NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/), [Gillick competence and Fraser guidelines | NSPCC Learning](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/child-protection-system/gillick-competence-fraser-guidelines). Children are understood by the medical system to be humans able to take some decisions of their own, have a say in their own lives while needing guidance and restrictions too. They are not property, neither of their parents nor the state.\n2. They don't get given the right to make major unalterable decisions. That is why they are not offered hormones or most major surgeries - but instead offered puberty blockers which pause puberty. It can then be resumed by either stopping taking the blockers OR by administration of hormone replacement therapy (E or T) at a suitable age. [Puberty blockers for transgender and gender-diverse youth - Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075)\n3. This decision is almost never made just by the child themselves. It is a course of treatment prescribed to the child with consent of the child, the parents and the relevant doctors.\n4. The most negativity that they could whip up about this in very biased, but still ultimately following the scientific method, research was \"not enough evidence\" (after discarding evidence that isn't double blind placebo trials - which aren't really applicable to this field because it is hard to lie to a child and say \"your puberty is blocked\" while they can visibly see and feel their body changing). That is not a clear case for \"stop it forever\", that is a case for \"we need more research\"... which everyone agrees with! Let sunlight be the disinfectant of misinformation - and if it agrees with the research that has already happened (showing safety, efficacy and reversibility) then we will resume the best course of treatment we already have. [Ban on puberty blockers to be made indefinite on experts‚Äô advice - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ban-on-puberty-blockers-to-be-made-indefinite-on-experts-advice)\n\nNone of this requires other people, or the state, sticking their nose in other people's business over it.\n\n>Medical dangers of transitioning.\n\nChildren only take these medications for a short window and thus long-term effects do not come into play. Any and all risks are weighed by the child, parents and doctors as a team.\n\nAdults are informed of any risks we know of (thus why it is called \"informed consent\") and choose to follow this path anyway.\n\nIn both cases - it is not for anyone else sticking their nose in to decide for them.\n\n>A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma. My mom's friend has a trans son and is clearly struggling with it, apparently called it a 'daily trauma'. I can't help but not give a fuck about that 'trauma', but any literature on this matter might help.\n\nI have seen this be described by parents and partners of trans people in a few ways. Sometimes they feel grief and as if their child/partner is dead. I don't quite get it - but I think it deserves empathy and those dealing with it deserve a way to navigate it. After a bit of searching just now I found the term \"Ambiguous Loss\".\n\n[Ambiguous loss: dealing with the loss of a child who is transitioning gender ‚Äì Offspring Magazine](https://offspringmagazine.com.au/parenting/ambiguous-loss-dealing-with-the-loss-of-a-child-who-is-transitioning-gender/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20normal%20to%20experience%20grief%20when%20a%20child,a%20transgender%20child%20to%20the%20process%20of%20transitioning.)\n\nI think the concepts of \"grief\", \"death of a loved one\", \"trauma\" and \"daily trauma\" are all the same emotion - and each is an unhealthy way to process it.\n\nThus perhaps introduce to them (and the friend maybe) this idea of Ambiguous Loss as a better way of explaining and coping with the feelings they are feeling.\n\nGood luck <3 :)\n\n¬†Part 3/3"

She's very through, and I find her very entertaining.\n\n\nI can speak a little to some of the other discomfort or weirdness that you mentioned. Gay trans women in our pre-transition state are often confused because a) we're attracted to women, b) but not like men are, and c) it can be hard to determine the line between attraction and admiration/envy. Cis lesbians deal with versions of all of these issues too, along with the broader construction called 'compulsive heterosexuality' or 'comp het'. For queer cis women, it often manifests as being unable to consider attraction to other women as a serious option. For queer trans women, it can also manifest in the flawed supposition that they must be attracted to men to be women.\n\n\nSo, a lot of what you see on queer forums is a mutual pushback against those large queer & transphobic social constructions. For someone not suffering under them directly, a lot of our communal reassurances may seem weird.\n\n\nThere's further points about queer people broadly being more open to kink or other alternative forms of identification. Furries, for instance, are very common in the trans community. The most basic way of understanding that is that once you've bucked social expectations for who to date and how to do your gender, you may as well look into any other 'strange' affinities you may have. If we're all gonna get rounded up into maga's gender camps or whatever, we may as well burn for being who we really are."

I figured out I was trans partially because of a fixation on gay men. I see my attraction to men as part of my gender. I also stereotype and infantilize masculinity (I have dinosaur pajamas and I watch ‚Äúboys‚Äù cartoons). I also, like the women you mentioned, find happiness in the gender that I am in sexual situations (good boy, etc). \n\nYou also, I imagine, don‚Äôt have an issue when cis women enjoy feminine things or their lesbianism. I really encourage you to examine the double standards you have and why they exist within you. After that, you should stop thinking so much about trans women. You should pick up the ‚Äúyou know what, who cares‚Äù mindset when it comes to things you find icky that aren‚Äôt actually hurting anyone."

    "comment_body": "Yeah, being trans isn't about gender roles, though gender roles can play a part in some trans people's dysphoria. Me, I've identified as a tomboy ever since I learned of that word, so if being trans were solely based on gender roles, I wouldn't be trans. I've simply identified as female for as long as I've known the difference between the 2 sexes (age 4). I know in myself that I was born this way.\n\nI can't say I've heard of that infantilizing thing tbh, but any behaviour a cis person is capable of engaging in, there will be some trans people who engage in it too. But I don't think trans people are any more likely to be that way than cis people. I very much feel I was denied a childhood, but I don't do the infantilizing thing, I just mourn for my lost girlhood internally.\n\nMuch kudos to you for turning your back on the TERF mindset. It can be incredibly hard to break out of that groupthink mentality, and question it when there's immense pressure applied to individuals to never question that toxic, ignorant rhetoric."

I don't know what your sexuality is, but like. Imagine you had to grow up as the other sex, while still being a woman and wanting to love women as a woman. If you were assigned male and grew up in that body, everybody would be telling you that you had to love women as Men do. Even if being a man and becoming a man grossed you out. Even if performing the societal dictates of being Buff and Masculine and romantically assertive made you feel like an alien in your body. Whatever women you connected with would be relating to you as a man, and expecting you to play the boyfriend role - and if you tried to love them in a way that felt more natural to you, but veered away from the Cishet Boyfriend expectations, they might react negatively or with disgust.\n* How would that make you feel? To be a woman who wants to love other women as one, to be able to recognize the way you want to love and be in relations with other women and \\*know\\* that's what you want, but be told you're Categorically Not Allowed to do that. You're categorically barred and also you're disgusting and wrong for wanting that and your feelings aren't real anyway. Sounds a lot like what lesbians come up in, yeah?\n* This is the environment and situation that transfem lesbians and sapphics come up in, with additional dimensions piled on top due to their transness. You have to work through potentially decades of living like that before you can realize that no you can be a woman, you do know yourself and know what you want, and it is possible to get there.\n\nYou've already had other folks talk to you about the infantilization, so I won't go into it here. But yeah there's a very real situation of \"I was denied a girlhood, I was never Allowed to be cute, and now leaning into cuteness feels good\". You don't have to like it, but you can leave them alone and not hang around the cuteness explosions if that's not your vibe. I don't hang around football fans when I have no interest in their team politics or fandom, but I share space and community with them as fellow men. I'm not a woman anymore, but lord knows when I was 15-16, I had some pretty bonkers ideas about womanhood and femininity. I had to learn about that shit as I got older, gained lived experience, and understood more about gender and society. Give them their space to learn and grow, and trust that this is not the only expression or version of transfemininity that exists."

    "comment_body": "Hmmmmmm I'm gonna go ahead and out myself here; I went from a TERF sympathizer, to ally, to transmasc journey, and I can pinpoint the very specific point that put that seed in my head. A post way back when on tumblr exploded that was arguing that a lesbian, upon discovering a girl that they were dating happened to be trans, if they declined continuing to date them on the basis they weren't attracted to their genitals, they were transphobic. And like, now, today, I understand there's a lot of nuance to that conversation. And I can look back now and recognize there were practically 0 trans voices or lesbian voices in that entire conversation, and it was predominantly between cishetero white women getting angry for the sake of being angry. \nUnderstand that a lot of TERF talking points stem entirely by people who have never interacted with trans women, or extremely rarely do. It's a group of people who sit and make monsters out of the shadows in the wall because they can't be assed to get up and see what is casting the shadows and learn. \n\nAnd before I talk about how I walked out of these terrible view points, I also feel it necessary to stress that I was born in a very conservative friendly neighborhood, with a lot of people that may not actively call you a slur to your face, but also do stupid shit like demand mexico build the wall. I was raised in a lot of bigotry, and didn't realize it wasn't normal until I hit college. Y'know. When I actually got to meet the people that the people around me were demonizing. \n\nThat being said, that IS the best you can do right now. Learn more about the experience. Read up what it means to be trans. Respectfully enter trans spaces with an open mind to learn. Because I'll be real with you: while I do get what you are low key implying by giving those examples, if a cis woman were to act that way, would you even bat an eye? Yeah sometimes it's a little cringe, but I know three cis women in my professional life that act exactly like that in their late 30's, early 40's. It's honestly just cringe because it's not young girls but adult women that are acting that way, and it's fair to feel that way lol but also, just please let these women get back into talks with the little girl they repressed for so long. Egg irl is mostly a safe space for trans women to express themselves I've noticed, they're allowed to be goof balls, y'know?\n\nI do know that this is a popularized TERF talking point thanks to JK Rowling, but also keep in mind when you see posts like this, there is a significant population of neurodivergent folk in the trans community. So it is very squarely in the realm of possibilities you are getting icked out by folk that are harmlessly expressing themselves authentically as neurodivergent women. \n\nBut, to recap with a TL;DR: You gotta both educate yourself and expose yourself to more trans voices. It'll come with time, you learned these view points from negative exposure, and you can unlearn them from positive ones.\n\nA pair of really good resources for me on the educational level were these:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QLWKYTxLYT4?si=CQi7sSQDVC-1zIXc\n\nhttps://genderdysphoria.fyi/\n\nAnd for trans voices? Honestly I just started to read webcomics of folk talking about their experiences and started to lurk in trans subreddits like this one. I followed my own interests, oops, it's all ftm content, shocker, so I don't know how much it'll help you specifically, but, I do love these three:\n\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/its-not-a-girl/list?title_no=889542\n\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/true-and-me/list?title_no=607331\n\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/slice-of-life/hyperfocus/list?title_no=3340"

This is a strategy to cope with little or no experience of being treated as a woman or something along those lines. It's being cringe the same way teenagers are cringe, trying to define one's self from a limited base of experience and knowledge. Except magnified through the lens of systemic oppression. \n\nExposure to trans women just existing and being people will help you emotionally grow from those beliefs. Being a good ally is the result of continually educating yourself about a group and materially helping them based on your learning."

I'd suggest engaging with trans women's writing and ideas, making sure you're not just reading or following one person, and remembering that being oppressed tends to make you easier to hate, while people who've been treated relatively well are easier to empathize with. For example, Nicole Maines had strong family support and good healthcare, so she doesn't bear the scars of testosterone puberty on her body and as a result people treat her better and see her subconsciously as female, while many trans women who've had much worse lives look visibly trans and are easily vilified as a result. The same patterns hold true with behavior; the most harmed trans people are likely to be the weirdest and hardest to empathize with. The way to stop this cycle of dehumanization is to point this out, stand up for us wherever it's safe to do so, and get to know us well enough that you can stand up for us through what are going to be rough times. \n\nBut every person you can help understand is one fewer person vulnerable to radicalization and control by people trying to use our oppression as a tool to control you."

So much classism, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, ableism, dehumanisation, and many more forms of bigotry üòî\n\nWhat you've done and are doing is fantastic, especially at such a young age ü©∑ Continue to listen to viewpoints, ask questions kindly without judgement, watch videos, read or listen to books, and gradually expand your knowledge and empathy ü´∂\n\nHappy to share some resources (websites, videos, books, content creators) you might find helpful.\n\nIt's okay if you don't connect with infantilisation. Many trans people don't either. It's more that certain voices are more prominent in any online community, especially where memes are commonplace. All you have to do is remember that such things things aren't universal or exclusive to the trans experience.\n\nThere's very much also an element of second puberty, especially (but not exclusively) for those on gender-affirming hormone therapy. Puberty is more than just physical and mood changes: it's about learning who you are and who you want to be. In the case of trans+ people, they're having to relearn so many aspects of themselves that were hidden, repressed, or never explored. \n\nThink back a few years to when your puberty started. How much has changed since then? Now imagine going through this again at a later age, which is sadly what most trans+ people will have to do, as they may not realise they're trans+ until later in life, know but be unable to access any healthcare, or know but try to repress it for various reasons üòî"

    "comment_body": "You've gotten some good responses, I'm just adding a couple of thoughts.\n\nPeople have mentioned about the early transition \"good girl\" phase, it's so common we (trans women) have a word for it, it's called the Pink Cloud. After a lifetime, often several decades, of being closeted, we can get a bit hyper after we come out, and want to catch up on experiences and emotions we've missed out on. It usually lasts up to a couple of years as we find our feet and experiment with our self- expression and exploring the spectrum of femininity, and often we go hyper-femme and girlish in the Pink Cloud for a bit before we find our way out.\n\nIt's harmless, and it's not weird; this is just a stage of development that happens for a lot of girls, but gets compressed and happens at an older age in trans girls. The kind of 'pink' phase a cis girl might go through in her early childhood gets delayed, in effect. My Pink Cloud phase wasn't actually pink, but I basically only ever worse dresses/skirts and avoided any shirt styles that were androgynous or masc for a few years. Eventually I settled down, finding how I like to do femininity and how I like to dress, and my wardrobe has shifted accordingly. The fancy socks, swishy skirts, learning make-up stage is just a common shared experience.\n\nPlaces like /r/mtf skew quite young, and/or quite early-transition, so there's more people in the Pink Cloud, proportionally. Feeling safe to be overtly feminine in a way that generally isn't safe in public can give people more motivation to do that online. So things like egg_irl and the like is almost... a pressure valve? Escape from stress, tension, fear, the closet, or the difficulties of early-transition into a space where we can be very femme and not be harmed for it.\n\nWith the \"I want to be a lesbian\" thing, it's because they are lesbians. They've just had a complicated experience of being in the closet, and the yearning they feel is to be out of the closet, to be a woman in a relationship with another woman, to be themselves. Cis lesbians and bi women who repress themselves and are closeted for a long time often experience a similar feeling of disconnection from oneself and envy of people who are out of the closet.\n\nYou won't be able to understand everything about trans women's experiences, because we're as complex and diverse as any group of women. We just had a complicated childhood, in a slightly different way to how many cis women can have complicated childhoods. You wouldn't judge a cis woman for having had a \"paint my bedroom pink, put flower stickers on my diary, play with dolls\" phase when she was eight, this really isn't different.\n\nIf you want to learn more about trans people, there are some more dense and complicated things you could try to read. *Whipping Girl* has been mentioned, which is good, but if you're going to try reading theory (and at 16, you're old enough to engage with writing that dense and complex) I have some other recommendations too.\n\nTalia Bhatt has [a substack where she posts essays about transfeminism](https://taliabhattwrites.substack.com/) and I think she's written some of the most engaging and important feminist writing published this year. Her essays 'The Third Sex' is a really good primer for learning more about third-world feminism and how much european/american feminism gets wrong when talking about other cultures; being aware of things like that helps navigate other people's writing.\n\nMay Peterson posts on Medium and sometimes has some essays that are quite personal, raw, or deal with heavy topics. But some of her essays are more theory-y, and [this one about different kinds of feminism and her own theoretical viewpoint is really quite interesting.](https://medium.com/@mayrpeterson/dialectical-feminism-an-unburial-theory-362a08e0244e)"

Sexuality and gender can intersect in strange ways, sometimes, and trans folk are not immune to internalized transphobia nor society‚Äôs stereotypes. Egg_irl is full of trans people working through insecurities and questioning themselves, so I wouldn‚Äôt look at it too deeply. Eggs are trans folk in the trenches, so to speak, and weird shit happens when you‚Äôre in denial. \n\nFor me, I grew up seeing a lot of gay and lesbian representation in media. I still experienced homophobia, but I saw positive examples of gay folk in the shows and books I watched, and figured that was ‚Äòan okay-ish thing to be‚Äô. Trans people, on the other hand? I had been taught that was the furthest thing from okay. But I couldn‚Äôt help my fantasies, yeah? I wanted to hold hands with a guy, or go on a date with a girl, all those puberty things that pop up whether you want them to or not.  \n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: I wasn‚Äôt fine entertaining fantasies of dating a guy *as a girl*. There was a weird disconnect in my mind, because I thought that I was born a girl and so I had to be a girl, and though I wanted to fantasize about being together with a guy when I did so it felt weird because of society‚Äôs expectations for what a ‚Äòstraight couple‚Äô looked like. Fantasizing about being with a girl felt less difficult, because people already expected lesbians to break gender norms, so there was less of an expectation there to be a girl in the ‚Äòproper‚Äô sort of way, or at least the proper way according to what society was telling me.\n\nIf only I had been born a gay man, I thought to myself, then I could feel comfortable with my attraction to men. \n\nThat‚Äôs where that kind of thing comes from, I think. People who have romantic interests in a certain gender, but struggle to accept the idea of being in a relationship with that gender pre-transition."

It's just that trans people are so used to being treated as lolcows online that we're just, like, f' it I'll embrace the cringe. It's kind of become part of the trans subculture to be cringey, just like it became part of gay subculture to be campy.\n\nLots of people, cis and trans, just like being called good boys and good girls in a romantic context. Ya, it's kinda infantilizing, that's the point. You see cis girls on \"yandere femcel girlfriend grippy socks jail\" posting the same kind of stuff.\n\nAs far as \"transitioning to be a lesbian\" stuff, I guarantee that's not the reason a person would transition, it's a consequence. But sometimes people read their current identity (trans lesbian, or trans gay) into their own history. Like, \"OFC I liked yaoi, I'm a trans gay man,\" or \"OFC I like lesbian erotic fiction, I'm a trans lesbian.\" It's probably entirely unrelated, but it's just part of how people see themselves and their own story. Like, you hear trans masc sometimes talk about transitioning because they want to become femboys. Does that sound weird to an outside? Sure. But it's 100% valid.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing a great job of demolishing your own transphobia, but the absolute best way to deal with the specific attitudes you described is: 1) there is no stereotype of trans women that doesn't apply to a larger number of cis women, 2) there is no stereotype of trans men that doesn't apply to a larger group of cis men, 3) the internet is mostly cats. Beyond that, it's good to make IRL friends with trans people if you can."

Forgive me if I'm incorrect, I'm mostly talking from personal experience here, but maybe you might relate? - I had to go through some pretty hard stuff around your age myself, and it made me grow up faster than a lot of people.

Any community that centers hatred of another group should raise red flags I think. \n\nBeyond what others have said I wanted to ask if you have access to therapy. First and foremost, it sounds like you‚Äôve experienced some very intense stuff already at a young age. I hope you‚Äôre getting support as you process everything. \n\nBeyond that, therapy is also a great place to explore why certain things (eg infantilization, gender roles, etc) create strong emotional reactions. It‚Äôs actually recommended that a lot of therapists do therapy themselves so they can have a place to work through any judgment or reactions they‚Äôre having towards their own clients, since it‚Äôs well understood that these kinds of feelings often have more to do with us than the other person. \n\nLastly, I can say on a personal level, that while in day to day life I dislike a lot of the infantilization stuff and don‚Äôt really relate to it, I do have moments where I‚Äôve allowed myself to play with it a little. There‚Äôs a few things going on I think, and all really have to do with the oppression we face in a sense. I‚Äôll explain below in case it helps. \n\nPrimarily, for me, it‚Äôs just a way of caring for my inner child, especially since i spent so much of my life hiding all those deeper emotional parts. An example would be how I recently found a kids book for little girls at the thrift store and got it for myself because for whatever reason it touched something in my hard and made me tear up a bit. I have a pink blanket with unicorns and some stuffed animals too. It‚Äôs just a very personal thing though about giving myself love and acceptance in a way I always struggled so much with. Frankly, I have cis friends who also have things like this, I probably just have a tiny bit more. \n\nSecond, there‚Äôs often a stage early in transition where we are figuring out who we are. This can mean trying all sorts of different styles, including ones too young for us. Like many young women do during puberty, I had moments where I tried to be a little extra ‚Äúgirly‚Äù because I wanted so badly to fit in and then as I continued to grow and figure out what being a woman meant to me I moved away from that. It can look odd probably because we are sometimes doing it at a later age, but the fact is we never had a chance to do this kind of identity exploration when young in most cases. So when you see it, try to realize it‚Äôs often transitory. And again, I‚Äôd ignore a lot of what‚Äôs in the internet lol. \n\nFinally, I‚Äôll admit very frankly that in some cases - and especially before my transition - my gender identity would show up in sexual ways. I kept this to myself, but I do think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge. As one of my therapists said, our sexuality is often a place where repressed parts of ourselves can show up safely as fantasy. I think a lot of the more sexual stuff you see can likely be explained in this way - the more people repress or feel shame around their gender or even the specifically younger expressions of their gender, the more it may show up in this way. Plenty of cis people also have ‚Äústrange‚Äù sexual fantasies so it‚Äôs in no way unique to us. My point is just to realize that when you see people online expressing their sexuality in off putting ways, sometimes its maybe an escape valve for repressed feelings they have no other outlet for. \n\nIt can also be a way to confront gender dysphoria, by trying to feel ‚Äúsexy‚Äù in your own body. I don‚Äôt know people post stuff on the internet, but I guess plenty of cis people do too. I have cis friends who take sexy photos of themselves for similar reasons, though they aren‚Äôt posting it. Personally, I get pretty uncomfortable with a lot of sexual stuff and so it bothers me sometimes when people are louder about this stuff and put it online but I know that‚Äôs more about me than them. \n\nAt the end of the day, every person is unique and I do believe in personal responsibility so I‚Äôm not trying to justify anything extreme. Have you heard of the fundamental attribution error in psychology, though? Perhaps that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting at. When we do odd or bad things, we often justify it in ourselves based on context. When others do those things, it‚Äôs very easy for us to decide it‚Äôs they are a ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúodd‚Äù person. We attribute it to who they are vs just being a potentially momentary or transitory behavior in reaction to some context (here, societal oppression and all the intense feelings of navigating puberty without the usual landmarks and support, plus the intense feelings of gender dysphoria). So I offer the above as a personal example of some of that context. \n\nI also think this perspective is important beyond just trans people. For what it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt hate TERFs or think they are bad people for what they say and do. I think what they say and do is bad. I am also sad for them. I imagine many have experienced trauma or for some other reason must be quite sad to act with so much fear and hatred, and my heart breaks for them. I used to work with a woman who I later found out was a very active TERF. She was a lovely coworker and mentor (this was all before my transition). People can be complex and I often wonder what happened to her and if she‚Äôs doing okay. Reading your post, I hope she too can find her way to empathy one day though I do worry she was a little too far gone."

If that is not your thing, then move on to other communities.  It is like a BDSM club: there will be a whole bunch of stuff that we are not into and may not even want to see.  Just look away, focus on what interests you.  Like furries, not my thing, but 0 hate for those who are into it.  Live & let live.\n\nAbout how to be the best ally?\n\nKinda touched on it already.  We do not have to be \"into\" something to support the rights and dignity of those who are.  You mentioned eggs and lesbians.  I am neither but will die on the hill of defending the lives and rights of both.  Same with the furries that I mentioned.  This is all that allyship requires.  Kindness, compassion, empathy are the keys to being an ally.  If you want to do more than that, you can volunteer, donate, pay it forward, make friends.  \n\nShould you argue with TERFS?  IDK, that is a risky proposition.  I do, but that is my thing.  So far the ONLY result from my arguments with TERFs is being misgendered despite the fact that I am post op and have a vagina.  I am legally & medically female with a birth certificate that says that I was born female and RealID that says that I am female yet TERFs who are aware that I am post op trans have ALWAYS misgendered me at which point I have blocked them.  So it seems a futile effort, but I continue to speak to TERFs as an example of how MtF transfolk are women.  I believe that am planting the seeds that they are wrong about calling someone with a vagina \"a man\".  I hope that it gets TERFs to question their hate but I have never once had a TERF EVER disavow what they had said or even gender me according to my genitals even after that was the definition that they gave initially."

Do it in real life too if you can.\n\nCame here mainly to say congratulations for changing your mind. Thank you so much üôÇ\n\nOn the subject of ick and cringe.\n\nI think this might be a pretty common story. There's part of me that's a mature woman and part of me who's still young and experiencing things that for most people happen when they're children. But for me as an older trans woman they didn't happen at the normal time. I had a very boy boyhood instead. To some extent childhood is childhood and I had a good one. But not having a girlhood means I'm playing catch-up later in life of large parts of being young and female. My young girl is joyful, silly, loves to move and dance and likes pink. A LOT! I love this girl very tenderly.\n\n\nDoes that mean I'm sometimes ick? Of course. Being young is when you make mistakes, try things out loudly and (sometimes) tastelessly. You're finding your style, finding out who you are. That means a lot of ick to cringe at later.\n\nThe mature woman who is also me, if I may say so, is extraordinary and I love her so much too. She's been right here all along. She's tender, strong, a gifted leader, doesn't take any shit from anyone and is full to the brim with passion, purpose and intelligence. Being your true self, ripping off the false mask, does that to you. She doesn't have a bone in her body that doesn't celebrate strong womanhood. In fact it's like she has escaped a lot of the conditioning cis women are gifted with growing up, that tells them they're not as good as men. It simply doesn't occur to her to compare herself unfavorably with men.\n\nI love both these \"people\", the young girl and the woman. They're both me. They both need to be expressed in the context of adult responsibilities and an adult life. It's important to find time for the girl as well as the woman because she's foundational. She's the solid ground my adult woman needs to stand on. Finding that solid ground as a trans person who lacks a childhood expressed as their actual gender is difficult and painful as well as joyful. And all this happens in and around the incredibly difficult thing it is to be trans at the present time.\n\nMany of us live our lives at a high level of intensity, balancing a need to grow as a child of the opposite gender to the one people assumed we were, transition, changing adult and family relationships, coming out at work simultaneously. And, of course, dealing with woeful public discourse and ignorance. The only way I have found enough strength to do all this, and it's barely enough some days, is in being myself. It's always tempting to hide. It's never really an option.\n\nOnline spaces are a good place to honour our girl selves, even by being silly and icky and a bit naive. What else could we be in second puberty? It doesn't mean trans teens and adults are not intelligent and mature as well. So please be as kind as you can in these relatively safe spaces."

I hope you‚Äôre working with a trauma-informed therapist to work through this stuff because honestly, that‚Äôs got to be a high priority based on what you went through.\n\nSo just some random thoughts: the whole ‚Äúwanting to be a lesbian‚Äù thing is a natural consequence of being a woman who loves woman who has only ever seen herself as a guy. You cannot know what a strange experience it is to feel kinship with lesbians pre-transition. It makes you feel bad, like you‚Äôre broken or committing a thought crime. Hearing people say as much online is pretty difficult to deal with. \n\n‚ÄúGood girl‚Äù in particular is definitely something that partners say to each other in a power exchange situation and isn‚Äôt necessarily even a trans thing. Cis dudes with cis girlfriends do this too. I personally find it validating when my gf calls me this in certain situations. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure what you mean by the infantilizing thing on r/MtF but if you wanna bring up a specific example I‚Äôm happy to comment on it.\n\nUltimately, though, living in a free society means peacefully coexisting with people who do things that give us the ick. And I think one way you can work on yourself is by genuinely asking if you‚Äôre holding trans women to a different standard than you do cis people in regard to that. You are absolutely valid if you think animal totems (catgirls, etc) are cringe, but it‚Äôs a part of online trans culture, it hurts nobody, and if you think that‚Äôs weird I implore you to wait until you‚Äôre a grown adult and see the cringe things cis people are into."

    "comment_body": "> I thought ppl were trans because they liked things associated with the other sex.\n\n\nI think this is a common misconception because it is a symptom or manifestation, and it is very hard to explain the cause both from the outside and from the inside.\n\n\nSimilarly the cringe stuff you are seeing online are just symptoms/manifestations of deeper feelings.\n\n\nI think in general you need to learn to look beyond the surface. You are doing, slowly, and that is wonderful. I think the best thing you can do is to stay curious.\n\n\nOne thing that it is important to remember is that something like transness has occured throughout history in some form. Something like it occured in the first society with writing, the Mesopotammians, as the gala priestesses who were blessed by Ishtar. Many smaller cultures around the world have niches for us. The Public Universal Friend existed amongst the Quakers.\n\n\nHow it manifests is different each time, because the manifestations are influenced by culture. Today, in our secular culture, we try to explain it scientificially as \"transgender\" as opposed to the blessings of a deity - but in many ways we are just as cultural as we have always been.\n\n\nBut just like any other form of queerness, it cannot be stamped out no matter how hard you try. That is what TERFs want to do - perhaps nonviolently and with 'kindness', but they want to stamp us out by making it socially and medically impossible to be trans. But it is a lost cause because you cannot suppress human nature."

You can find cis girls who dress hyperfeminine, who lean into being \"cutesy,\" who self-infantilize, who like being called \"good girl\" (usually that's a kink thing...being a lot more out-in-the-open about kinks is common in the LGBTQ community more generally, there are some historical reasons for that with how all LGBTQ identities were seen as \"perversion\" anyway, causing us to ally with BDSM and kink and refuse to be ashamed of our sexuality--so some of the sexual TMI is more a general LGBTQ community thing rather than a transfeminine thing specifically).\n\nI (AFAB nonbinary) had some hyperfem phase stuff as a teenager too. (I had some masculine stuff also as a teenager, I'm bigender so it's sort of to be expected.) I was into catgirls and drew pictures of lesbian catgirls and got sparkle-eyed over anime yuri and honestly if a trans girl dressed the way I dressed people would call it \"AGP.\" (I assume if you were in the TERF rabbit hole you know what that is.) I had boxes of lingerie catalogs hidden under my bed, and sexy cheesecake art on my walls. Like I would have been the most cringe trans girl except I was AFAB so no one could say it.\n\nThere's a pretty broad spectrum of how women express femininity. Hyperfemininity, queer femininity, and all that terminally online nerd girl stuff is part of it--and cis girls do it too. And not only are a lot of the girls in these spaces you're seeing teenagers themselves, but a lot of them are also autistic (trans people *are* disproportionately likely to also be autistic, though of course not all of them are--I'd wager the terminally online nerds are an even higher percentage likely though) and autistics can have a harder time fitting in and coming off as \"normal\" and can often seem weird and \"extra.\" A lot of my cringe \"extra-ness\" in how I presented my femininity is probably my own autism--and a lot of the nerdy cis girls who act similarly to these trans girls are probably also autistic.\n\nMy gf also doesn't necessarily *present* in some of these ways IRL (neither do a lot of the people on egg_irl for that matter--like my gf, they have body image issues) but she can be similarly nerdy, into the same aesthetics, says stuff like \"I relate, I also want to be an anime waifu,\" and she's cis. But she's queer and likely some variety of neurospicy--much like a lot of these trans girls.\n\nI don't think it's transphobic to find some girl cringe--you're a teenager yourself, finding other teenagers cringe is basically your job. But ask yourself, if the girl behaving this way was cis, would you judge her exactly the same way?\n\nI think it's also important to remember that just because this is the kind of femininity some trans girl somewhere online enjoys, doesn't mean she, or anyone, is saying \"this is what a woman is,\" or \"all women are like this, to be like this is to be a woman.\" She's just *that kind of girl* herself--doesn't mean that's the only kind of girl. And there are cis girls who are also *that kind of girl*, but part of why we don't judge them the same way is because how they perform femininity isn't burdened with the expectation of \"show me what being a woman is to you.\" They can just express themselves without it being seen as a statement on what womanhood *is*. So as long as they aren't *saying* that there aren't women who express other kinds of femininity, don't read that into their expression."

When they were living as a man, they probably didn't like the role they were playing in the relationship but they still like the girl. So that is probably where The I want to be a lesbian thing came from The self infintalizing  thing Comes from a place of I missed out. On my a feminine childhood when I was a kid. A lot of the time I also see Cis Woman doing the same thing. A lot of these things are also just stereotypes as well."

I think your first priority should be to unpack the trauma of what you went through. You can't be an ally if you aren't taking care of yourself first. \n\nBeyond that, though, if you really want to be an ally, there's a lot you can do to learn, but let's start with this:   \n  \nThe uwu catgirl stuff. It's weird. Weird does not translate to bad. Figuring out your identity on the heels of a lifetime of repression and misery is a *big deal*. It's easy to get caught up in the joy of it in ways that an outside observer might cringe at. They'll either grow out of the behavior or they won't. Either way, it doesn't seem like it's anyone's business but their own, is it?\n\nIf you don't like eggirl, then don't go to eggirl. It's not hurting you.\n\nHere's the thing: Plenty of trans people are perfectly \"normal\" in their behavior. In every imaginable way, some of us are *completely* socially acceptable. Offline grass-touchers with 9-5s and a picket fence. But because we are trans, we're treated like freaks and deviants no matter what we do, where we go, or how hard we try to assimilate. There is no amount of acceptability that protects us from discrimination, fear, and judgement. If the game is rigged, why blame people for not playing?\n\nLet them have their joy. It's frankly more important than your discomfort."

I think you've already gotten a lot of solid advice about what that apology could look like, but there is debate over whether or not you should actually bring it up.\n\nMy personal perspective is when in doubt, talk it out. Honestly, many redditors and people (at least in the US) are superrr averse to open communication, but I think it's important. Talking about your mistakes is a great way to build trust, and if it's really such a big deal that you shouldn't even bring it up, I question the health of the relationship in general, ya know? Like, you can bring it up now, and worst case scenario, the relationship ends, or it can come up after building up resentment for months in an explosive breakup like, 3 months from now. It's obviously up to you, but I really encourage you to just chat about it now (I also really doubt it will be a huge deal personally)"

For a lot of trans girls hearing \"you don't pass\" can sound the same as \"I don't see you as a woman\" which is tied into a lot of internalised transphobia which doesn't help. Yeah, your response was clumsy, but unless she brings it back up let it lie, you aren't gonna make her feel better trying to explain yourself, you'd only be doing it to ease your own conscience."

It‚Äôs not very clear what her intention was in asking you that question. Sometimes people ask questions for positive feedback which isn‚Äôt healthy unless that‚Äôs specifically what they‚Äôre asking for and being honest about it with themselves. It does sound like she was hoping to pass and not passing might make her dysphoric because it doesn‚Äôt make her feel like a woman, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs your responsibility to make her feel that way. What you can do is be honest with how you see her as a woman and treat her as a woman.\n\nIf you want to bring this up again to make sure it doesn‚Äôt build into anything negative, then you could let her know that what you had said might felt like it was othering her, but you could then reaffirm that you see her as a woman. In the follow-up you could also try to gauge what her expectations of the question was and that might lead you to find out if it was a little thing or if it was something she might come to resent later and then to act accordingly. \n\nOne more suggestion, (I didn‚Äôt check, but) you might also want to cross post in r/actuallesbians since there are a lot of cis and trans lesbians in that sub and they might have both trans and cis perspectives to ponder on."

She put a lot more effort into being a woman than I have thats for sure, although even if she didn‚Äôt I would still see her as one.

    "comment_body": "This is how I best can explain it.\n\n- **Before HRT** arousal was like a switch. It comes quickly and can go just as quick. I see someone I like, I get horny, simple as that. It‚Äôs much easier to trigger physically too. The more I found them hot the more horny, the more physical touch, the more horny. Mentally it‚Äôs there too, but I can be mentally not horny and still get aroused. It can go as high as possible but can end fairly quickly too.\n\n- **After HRT** arousal was like a slow roasting coal fire. It wasn‚Äôt as flashy and quick, but once it became hot it took longer to cool. I see someone who turns me on and there‚Äôs a spark, but it doesn‚Äôt get going unless I foster it. It‚Äôs mostly mental, not so much in-head fantasy, more like that feeling you get when hugging someone. That said, when physical touch is involved it more so fans and spreads the flames of arousal than add to it. It‚Äôs a lot more difficult be physically horny if my mental state isn‚Äôt there though. The higher the horny the harder to become unaroused though \n\nI‚Äôm not really sure when it changed. I say around the 1 year mark is when I noticed, but to be fair I didn‚Äôt have sex again till that point. It‚Äôs not something I really even thought about till recently. I wonder if it‚Äôll change again after my surgery, eh probably a bit. Overall, girl horny if I had to guess means a similar arousal feeling most women get, slow but hard to put out. \n\nTL;DR\n\nRegular horny = Quick to start, quick to end\n\nGirl horny = Hard to start, harder to end."

Also was not happy with my body even when getting ripped. There was a lot of feelings missing with sex and a lot of boredom with it. At times a lot of resentment with it, felt I usually enjoyed it less or it was more fleeting than my partners.¬†\n\nAfter HRT. More melty and entrancing. Being fondled feels more exciting and satisfying. Cuddles are more satisfying. My nipples always got me turned on but like it‚Äôs times 6 now. I get a more intense stirring in my chest that radiates outward. Finishing is more like a wave crashing on me and then washes over me again slowly on the come down. Still versatile and lean towards soft dom and top, but the way I interact with sex and my body feels so much better. My penis has a less powerful reaction orgasm wise, but my body responds more. Penis still experiences plenty of pleasure and works while topping at almost a year HRT.\n\nHRT plays a role for sure, but so does loving my body more, so does truly being more firm with my likes and dislikes sexually, so does embracing how I like to have sex. So does having sex with people who truly see me for me, even the short hook ups."

Five years ago, when British Columbia launched its Gender Surgery Program, they held an [information session](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvancouver/comments/d5tph0/info_session_for_gender_surgery_program_6pm_at_vgh/) with ~200 people attending in person. It's pretty safe to say that nearly all of the people in the auditorium were trans.\n\nI'd say that roughly half of them passed, at a glance. The caveat is that there would have been a mix of trans men, trans women, and nonbinary people, and many of them would have been at an early stage in their transition. By that logic, I'm guessing that given a long enough transition, more than 50% of trans women who make an effort to present as women would pass at first glance?"

Obviously none of this is a strict standard to be seen as a woman but a combo of those factors would make people doubt their gender. Somewhere between 4 months and 2 years, things changed.\n\nWith time, almost all of them started to pass. Plenty of them still had some of these features but it didn't really matter. There's women of all shapes and sizes out in the world and most people aren't trying to \"transvestigate\" people. \n\nIt absolutely can take more or less effort depending on what your starting point is but very few trans women won't pass if that is their goal."

Don‚Äôt trust face app btw - it did give me euphoria sometimes when I needed it but it also applies makeup and does other stuff so it‚Äôs not necessarily how you‚Äôd actually look and it can start to cause unrealistic expectations. If you‚Äôre overall bone structure / body isnt too masculine to begin with then there‚Äôs a good chance of passing I think but it does take a lot of time and a lot of work. Some people on here seem to pass in like 6 months but I think 3 years of HRT is more realistic, plus tons of really hard voice work, and possibly FFS depending on your bone structure. I started in my mid 30s, around 5‚Äô7ish and a little feminine to begin with (though I also looked like a relatively normal ‚Äúguy‚Äù too - I wasn‚Äôt someone who passed pre HRT or anything, I just had a small chin, sparse facial hair, minimal brow ridge, etc). I probably would‚Äôve passed on HRT alone but wanted FFS to seal the deal and feel more secure. With that and voice training I do pass. I can still clock myself based on voice though and would like to work more on that still but I don‚Äôt get misgendered anymore so it‚Äôs fine for now. It‚Äôs like some of those trans actresses where if you know what you‚Äôre looking for you can tell right away bc of something subtle in the voice or something but overall they pass. I think that‚Äôs a realistic expectation for most people tbh as long as you work on your voice and are open to surgery if needed. If you have super masculine bones/body it might be harder but as others have said the reality is there are also cis women I‚Äôve met who are tall, or broad shouldered, etc. You just need goals and expectations based on you, not based on Reddit/instagram girlies."

It doesn't really get rid of it. Electrolysis, laser, extensive shaving regimens, and makeup can do a lot there. Having lighter colored hair in the first place helps a lot. I find that red hair is the most forgiving. Because the warm tone kind of cancels out the shadowy tone of scruff. It's actually one of the key makeup tips, is to use a kind of orangey red base before putting everything else on for that exact reason. \n\nIf you can conceal facial hair, most other non-conformities are unlikely to give you away. Voice is probably the next biggest thing and HRT doesn't help with either. You could look at this as a scary thing, but you could also look at it as the promise that there are things you can do now to work on it without committing to HRT. And if you think the voice and facial hair can be concealed effectively, you're probably golden. I wouldn't normally advise this, I tend to advise people get on HRT ASAP. It's amazing what the chemistry does to help a dysphoric mind. But if safety is a key concern, those two steps might make sense to address first"

One is a survey asking trans people if they pass and 1/4 of trans women and 2/3 of trans men say they pass. Another study surveyed random people online asking what the agab was for trans women pre and post FFS and im that 1/2 passed before surgery with low confidence from raters, and 98% passed post surgery with high confidence (same as the cis women controls they used).\n\nPhotos online are angles, filters, and makeup. It's easy for me to take a picture of myself as a beautiful woman. Irl, if I'm wearing makeup and androgynous women's clothes, maybe 10-20% of the time I'll be gendered female, but mostly people go out of their way to avoid gendering me (eg go out to dinner and everyone gets called sir or ma'am but I'll just be \"and you\") and I'm over a year HRT.\n\nMy biggest fear pre transition was that I wouldn't pass, and while it's true I don't, is not anywhere near as bad as I was afraid, and I'm optimistic more time and FFS will change things dramatically.

I got all female pronouns. I told one person that i was trans and she asked me why i wanted to be a boy since i was so pretty. \n\nsince my 20's i have been gendered female on the phone due to my voice. utilities, banks, etc. would ask me, \"is this his wife\"? i can not argue the fact that i am viewed as female. \n\nnow i live and work female. i do not hide who/what i am. just this past week i said something to a person about my wife. his response was \"you have a wife?\"\n\nit is also about confidence and context. my gf is passible, a tall, skinny (celtic) ginger with natural curves. she tries to not be noticeable so she dresses androgynous, (track pants, hoodie, no purse, etc.) and avoids eye contact and people altogether. this behavior is suspicious for a woman and draws more attention herself  and will get clocked as trans. i wear skirts, carry a purse, smile at people, say hello, etc. and i almost never get clocked as trans. i frame my context as female. \n\nthose who clock me are either members of the LGBT community or close friends/family of someone who is LGBT. my friends and i say, **once you see behind the curtain, everyone is suspect**. \n\nwhat we don't hear about is cis women get clocked as being trans (brittney griner. caitlin clark). we also do not hear about the issues that cis women have: thinning hair, not pretty enough, facial hair, etc., the same issues that many of us transfems have. this is a form of dysmorphia and self bias. \n\nwhat i found is that if i glance in the mirror quickly and look at the person as opposed to looking at me, i see the woman and i find that woman very attractive."

Once you know how to fight, people around you will recognize it subconsciously in your stature and presence. You'll be much less likely to get fucked with when they spidy-sense that you're a threat.\n\nGetting into downvote territory here: and to answer your question, in my opinion, no, most trans women do not pass.

Before that it was the Satanic panic, which was far more fun, but yeah our society seems to cycle through panics and the trans panic too, shall pass.\n\nIt's being used as a political wedge issue, unfortunately. It helps to remember that people in power use fear to maintain their power.\n\nBack when politicians and religious leaders were using gay people to create panic, the talking points about gay people were incredibly similar: Mental illness, confusion, influence by other gay people, books they read, TV shows they watched caused gayness. Nobody was born gay. Did you know gay men try to indoctrinate teen boys into the club?! Yeah, stuff like that. Everything we now try to tell scared people about trans people we had to explain to them about gay people. \n\nEventually it passed because so, so many gay people came out of the closet and shocked America. Suddenly, everybody knew someone who was gay and while it's easy to hate the group it's really hard to hate an individual you know and care about.\n\nThis has largely already happened in my city with trans people. My trans gson isn't bullied for being gay (most kids at his school assume he's a gay guy, not a f2m trans kid) and those who know he's trans don't even think about it. When he gets in fights with his friends who know they don't weaponize it. It's just a nonissue and truly the least interesting thing about him. This is the future everywhere, just like gay people ended up being largely accepted. \n\nHang in there, this will improve with time. People change slowly but they do change. I'm so sorry you're unable to access puberty blockers but as an adult you'll be free to be yourself. I wish you had accepting parents, though. Just ugh, sorry you're in this spot."

You could be interacting with gay people out in public and not even know it. The only difference is which gender they like, which rarely comes into play during day to day interactions. \n\nBut for trans people? Especially those who are visibly  trans, it's likely we invoke discomfort in some folks who are not used to interacting with us."

And \"gay\" hasn't arrived.

    "comment_body": "Something people haven't been posting here is the overlap between trans issues and patriarchy.\n\nPatriarchy requires men to enforce it if they want to benefit from it. It is a caste system. Under patriarchy, men give up personal identity to serve the collective identity of patriarchal masculinity, and in return reap rewards/privileges it promises. It's why even cis straight men who do wear nail polish, dye their hair, or wear makeup also face social backlash from other men - it's a threat to their social order.\n\nIn the lens of patriarchy, women are prizes (property) to be won for whom men compete. By oppressing men who don't serve the collective identity of patriarchy, they protect their access to women.\n\nPatriarchal men are afraid that gay men will treat them as objects the way they themselves treat women. They resent Lesbians as they upset the order by \"competing\" for the \"resources\" that are other women. This view has become less common as more straight men have come to understand that gay men don't want them, and gay women wouldn't even if there weren't other Lesbians to date.\n\nTrans people however intentionally break from patriarchy in a way that is a real threat to the system.\n\nTrans men challenge masculinity because the patriarchal definition cannot include them - remember it is a narrow spectrum that even prejudices itself against cis men who don't adhere to it at every turn.\n\nTrans women and femmes really break the brains of patriarchal men though. In their estimation, we are not just breaking from the patriarchy - the power of which scales with the number of people enforcing it - we spit in its face.\n\nTo be afforded the means to enter patriarchy and to shirk that in service of - in their minds - becoming an object of the lesser class - is an insult in and of itself. They can't understand why we would do this, so they often assume that we are still men using transition as a means to gain access to women's spaces through nefarious means to undermine the racket of patriarchy - fox in henhouse logic. If you're a femme top who has sex with women or people men perceive as women, this is even more the case.\n\nWhen we are perceived or treated as women by men who want to fuck us, they are afraid that patriarchy will come for them if other men know they've fucked us. They know how they themselves punish and exclude those who do not confirm to and affirm patriarchy, and are terrified of being on the other side of that.\n\nThere is no way for us to be integrated into patriarchy in the way that *some* gay men and women have been. This fight will only end when patriarchy is dead, or we are - and we aren't going anywhere"

Eggs are in the boat of thinking every member of their birth sex would gladly give it up to be the other and just doesn't say so, so they may become transphobes angry \"others get to transition but they don't.\"\n\n3.) Medical intervention. They see everyone else in the alliance just wanting to be with someone else. None of the other letters require changing their biology into to be satisfied. Not saying every trans person does either, but we all know dysphoria is a strain on those that have it and that treating it is beneficial for them. Requiring things outside the self makes them see it as less legitimate or natural even though that's like most other health conditions.\n\n4.) age. The only parts of their gender they really acknowledge are the parts having to do with sex. When a kid says they want to be another gender, others instantly leap to thinking they are too young to feel it because they haven't had sex, that the feelings are ALL about sex, or that someone else told them to feel that way (grooming).\n\n5.) politicization. Trans people are just a group too small a voting block to matter to many politicians, so they use them as a target for outrage born out of misunderstanding. Like how they blame gays for hurricanes. The only difference is that the others letters are too many people to ignore, so they can't just be opposed to every group in the alliance."

Never mind that we never not were male to begin with.\n\nFtM *might* not get *quite* as much heat, because at least they have good sense: Men can relate to why someone would want to be a man.\n\nMost people really don't GAF.  The politicians pander to the religious right, because they are the ones who reliably vote; there were over 600 anti-transgender bills introduced for passing in 2023 and an even higher number so far in 2024.\n\nOnce people get to meet us / talk to us... they tend to become reassured we're 'just' ordinary people.  And I never fail to remind them that no, \"children\" are not having their genitals cut off; that there were not quite 60 total tg surgeries between 2019-2021 (and those were predominently for girls 17+ who had excessively large breasts);\n\nAnd that 'children' are not given puberty blockers until they have begun puberty AND if they are having a LOT of problems with it.  PB's first began to be used for **cisgender** children who had precocious puberty, or puberty which begins by age 8 for girls and age 9 for boys.  No 8 year old girl needs to be having periods or should be going around with voluptuous, womanly breasts: she would attract unwanted attention from men much older than she and they would interfere with her relationships with their peers because she'd be so different from them.\n\nThose with precocious puberty might take PB's until about age 14 - or 6 more years beyond their 8 years, or 75% of their lifetime when they started... *with no ill effects noted*, as least not in the past half-century of daily use.  It's only *transgender* children the religious right frets about.\n\nWill people accept you?  Yes.  Most will.  Some won't.  (The younger generation really doesn't care; children don't discriminate *unless and until they are taught to*.)\n\nI was in a bar shooting pool with friends last night; some random woman loudly decided \"I'm a MAN, and she was going to introduce me to Jesus!\"  I said that's fine as long *as he doesn't do any of those 'miracle shots'; he has to play fair*.  Then I asked if he likes sex... and she went ballistic (security had to ask her to leave).\n\nSay, *didn't that guy say something about \"not judging\"?*\n\nDon't worry about it.  That \"mentally ill, pervert and groomer\" stuff is right out of the 1970s-early 80s; it was what people then said about gay people.  It will take time for all this to quiet down; we're just being used as throwaway political pawns.  When the current crop of predominently older white male supremacists fade away and the next generation becomes elected, we'll all be better off.\n\nThere are REAL problems to take care of: health & property insurance, education, infrastructure, inflation, global warming and so much more.  Today's politicians are ignoring all of those to spend their finite time on us, and people will get pissed about it soon enough."

The harder, and more correct one, takes us back to the 1500s and the foundations of modern medicine, what alchemists thought, the genocide of women across central Europe during the Dark ages. Why Christianity is absolutely obsessed with destroying any examples of feminine power, to the point the Knights Templar, who rode into battle at 50:1 odds and succeeded -- an unmatched achievement in military history, was deleted practically overnight at the height of their power and influence -- *for secretly worshipping Mary*. \n\n\nWe'd have to talk about the cultural appropriation of pagan mythos, what the blending of masculine and feminine means in eastern versus western philosophies, and then the civil war's conclusion which saw both the defeat of racism but also anti-intellectualism: Racism was viewed as outdated in the light of actual scientific advancement -- specifically Darwin's publication of *The Origin of the Species*, which led to the formation of the eugenics movement. How our civil war seeded white nationalist movements across the globe, much as is happening again now. \n\n\nChristianity's violent oppression of gender minorities is not a wedge issue, it's central to their religion and the current moral panic is because in the last few years the majority of young women are identifying as *not religious* in this country. We cleared 50% last year and the trend is only straight down across all demographics. The word of God is dead in the mouths of three generations now and in their violent rage they're trying to inspire another world war in the belief an angry and desperate population will \"find God\". \n\n\nThey'll be bombing the \"abortion clinics\" (just clinics, actually -- the playbook never changes) next, because \"My body my choice\" has nothing to do with reproductive freedom but rather how evangelical christianity took over modern medicine in the 1850s with medical licensing and credentialing and that's how they pushed women out of medicine, declared midwivery illegal, called the granny midwives that kept black women alive charlatans, and enforced laws barring women from helping other women. And at every step since we've been fighting a \"culture war\". \n\n\nAnd they're all very desperate for everyone to not understand feminism is fundamentally a labor rights movement, and that's what happened at the start of the last century with the suffragist movement: Women rose up and flung their wooden shoes into the machines, acts of *sabotage*, to save the children from being chewed up by the machines of industry. Literally.\n\n\nBut if you're a middle class white person all of this is invisible and it's \"just a wedge issue\", rather than part of a larger pattern of behavior stitched into the country's cultural DNA."

Once they are actually in power im pretty sure that will go a lot further, including access to care (which Trump has mentioned).

His reaction is over the top, but for all I know, he's never even seen a horror movie before. And I'm not sure a person wouldn't have the same reaction just from regretting losing out on their childhood to stuff they're not sure they believe in anymore. I think based on the info presented, it's equally likely he's a gay man. He may not even fully know the difference between those things yet, based on how oppressive his upbringing sounds. \n\nI wouldn't jump to any conclusions, let alone push him out of the nest. Leaving an upbringing like that is a LOT to deal with, freshman year of college is a LOT to deal with (especially for sheltered kids), and figuring out whether you can continue that education if your parents could disown you is a LOT to deal with. It sounds like he's already putting in some work trying to figure it out himself, so it's not like he's just ignoring it. Let him keep exploring on his own, and keep doing stuff like suggesting movies and inviting him to places where queer and trans people might be, if you want to. Now, if you choose not to live together in the future and may lose touch, yeah, it might be worth mentioning something a *little* more direct.\n\nJust keep your eye on the prime directive. The tendency to burrow further into the closet if confronted with an actual endpoint to their experimentation or answer to their questioning hits way harder when they're from a strict religious upbringing.

Anyway.\n\nAs a trans/genderqueer Christian who grew up in an extremely conservative bubble: that conservative brainwashing shit runs ***DEEP,*** to the point that most people who believe it are open and vocal enough about how they consider such things to be facts of life that anybody who might have corrected them rightfully wants to be as far away as possible.\n\nAt the same time, though, your friend sounds a lot like how *I* used to be, complete with inadvertent dickishness before coming face to face with the fact that someone \"normal\" is in fact \"one of those Horrid Nasty (INSERT SLUR HERE)s,\" but isn't anywhere *near* \"horrid and nasty\" like he'd been taught to expect. He's even starting to mellow out about it, from the sounds of things, and he's even doing so faster than I did üòÖ\n\nIf he continues to be anything like me, I'd expect he's probably trying to reboot his brain to account for things like:\n- The people who have been teaching me God's Truth for the entirety of my life *lied to me*\n- Calling people who aren't straight or cisgender\\* \"freaks\" or worse isn't necessarily an accurate descriptor\n- (I doubt he would be using the term \"cisgender\" in his head yet, just because of how allergic to it conservative talking heads are, but he's definitely thinking of \"people who agree with whatever doctor held them up when they were born and said 'it's a boy' or 'it's a girl'\")\n- (The revelation that being a \"freak\" isn't necessarily a bad thing can come another time.)\n- (So can the revelation of the existence and validity of genders outside the binary and intersex people.)\n- Oh, wow, that movie *really* struck a chord in me.\n\nAnd then from here, depending on whether your roommate is an egg or not, you could either get:\n- Oh, *no,* are these the kinds of things my roommate might have to deal with? Just, y'know, in the opposite direction?\n- I've been part of the *problem.*\n- üò®\n\nOr:\n- But I mean, I'm pretty sure *everybody* has these kinds of feelings about themselves, and it's just whether they act on them or not that makes them sinful freaks, and *I'm* not a-\n- *wait shit **that's the harmful stuff I was lied to about.***\n- But. Wait.\n- Hang on.\n- üò≥\n\nEither way, he'll probably be wrestling with his identity and self-image here, whether as a cishet Christian trying to figure out how the Bible he's been taught can be so against people who are just minding their own business, or as a queer individual of whatever kind trying to piece together the remains of the queerphobic Christianity they grew up in. The fact that he's already genuinely had a sort of \"come to Jesus\" moment upon realizing that you are trans and that trans people are not the caricature in his mind, *and* that he's since dialed the dickishness back and even watched a queer movie without looking for reasons to hate it- those are both *HUGE* points towards the idea that he heard \"hate the sin, love the sinner\" and *genuinely* thought \"oh ok, so we're not supposed to go out of our way to be jerks to people who might not be exactly like us.\"\n\nIt sounds like you've got the whole \"showing him that LGBT+ culture is more than just the stuff his pastor probably ranted about\" thing well underway, but I have a few resources for the Christianity side of things, if you feel comfortable passing them on.\n\n- Blessed are the Binary Breakers is something I'm most familiar with as a Tumblr user, but Avery (the one behind it) has a podcast and a full-on website for it- ze can be found on blessedarethebinarybreakers.com\n- For a more Reddit-specific thing, r/DankChristianMemes is a very chill and laid-back place for queer Christians, and they have quite a few extra resources available in case he wants something more than memes. There's also an Automod comment that pops up whenever a post is made regarding LGBT+ people with a list of verses explaining why the sub is queer-friendly and will *remain* queer-friendly.\n\nAnd if anybody wants to ask why I, a Christian, cussed in this comment and cuss even *more* like a sailor outside of it, I offer three rebuttals:\n- We're told not to use *the Lord's name* in vain, not the names of earthly things that are commonly regarded as gross anyway.\n- Even if we *were* instructed to not use the names of anything in creation in vain, \"using in vain\" does not translate directly to \"vulgarity.\" It's more of [\"don't go doing something God doesn't like and claimIng it's what God wants because of uhhhhh You Say God Says So.\"](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/bible-study/what-does-it-really-mean-to-take-the-lords-name-in-vain.html)\n- You look me in the eyes and tell me the son of a carpenter, just as fully human as He is fully divine, never, ever, not *once* smashed His thumb with a hammer and squawked the aramaic equivalent of the fuck word. Look me in the eyes and run the very real risk of *lying* to me."

It's about living a horribly soul crushing timeline where you never transition and slowly die silently screaming in pain. That movie fucked me up for a couple days and I had already been out for a while so I can only imagine how hard it is to watch as a trans person who has been forcibly closeted for so long and probably never even felt it was a possible life for them.\n\nTo me this is one of the biggest tells, along with the fan-girling over meeting a beautiful trans woman and getting awkward and defensive about the nails. I agree with the general sentiment in this thread that you have to let 'him' figure it out on his own time, but this is 100% a trans girl. This is of course just my opinion but its lighting up the transciever.\n\nAnd, I mean, and you guys are roommates. I have no scientific evidence, for this but I do have mountains of anecdotes that proves that somehow, even when closeted, we always find each other, we just do. And that's beautiful and I think you, OP, should just try and cherish the relationship as much as possible, because one or both of you probably needs it right now."

This one is the least challenging to do to oneself and probably the most relatable to all of us as trans folks. It‚Äôs not good self-care and it‚Äôs not something we should be doing to ourselves if we find ourselves feeling the pain of it if we do so. i.e., *If you don‚Äôt have to, then avoid avoid avoid.* Go give yourself a tiny thing to feel good about instead: listen to a fave song, go outside on a nice day, give nuzzins to your four-legged overlord, eat a food you love, whatever gives you a bit of joy.\n\n2) There is the act of monitoring for sake of work, advocacy, and/or activism, much as zinnia or Erininthemorning do. (It is something I can‚Äôt do myself, as I am too close to much of it and have been too close to it for generations.)\n\n3) There‚Äôs also the act of monitoring remarks and takes as a *social-political barometer*. This has been my approach for a long time. I couldn‚Äôt do this back in, say, 1999, back when I‚Äôd been tranning for under a decade. Then, it‚Äôd have been self-injurious *only*. But now, in my fourth decade of this, and yes, hardened by all I‚Äôve bore witness, I do open comments on articles or, less often, social media (as I left social media years ago), to take a pulse on whether (and how) things may be improving or worsening for us.\n\nTaking these reads isn‚Äôt some simple, up/down scale, but more a plotting in 3D-space. I do so because I need no illusions on the state of matters and on what I must do to prepare not only myself, but also other trans folks in my life on the contours of what lies ahead. \n\n[Not necessarily explicitly so, either. For example, I don‚Äôt tell the 11yo trans kid in my family about what I‚Äôm seeing. What I *do* do is offer them motes of encouragement and self-empowerment which they can comprehend and use right now ‚Äî to show, rather than to tell, especially since when I begin to ‚Äútell‚Äù, the ‚Äúomgggg old graunty-borrrrring-stoppppp‚Äù spills out and I‚Äôll be ignored anyway.]"

If it does, breast reduction surgery is the way to go.\n\nHowever, there are combinations that might reduce the odds or the amount of breast growth. I'm not sure how scientifically it is, but people say that progesterone, if taken from the start of the HRT treatment, can stunt breast growth. It is something that you would need to talk to a doctor, tho. Maybe an endocrinologist.\n\nEven then, HRT provides no guarantees are far as physical appearance goes. Genetics will rule, first and foremost. \n\nHowever, Estrogen might make a huge difference for his mental health. THAT is pretty much universal. \n\nIs his partner supportive? The fact you are supportive is most than most people get, so thank you for being this wonderful parent."

That leaves the various cosmetic options. Laser hair removal, skin care, hair styles, etc. Contouring makeup can create an illusion of a a different jaw shape - look up a theatrical makeup guide to learn how! Sometimes insurance covers laser for the face, that's extremely dependent on what state you live in and what your insurance plan is. Facial feminization surgery (FFS) is a possibility in the future, but he won't be able to access that until after he's 18 and it's incredibly expensive unless your insurance covers it.\n\nSince you mentioned mental health, I suggest reading this article: [How Gender Dysphoria Manifests: Biochemical Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/biochemical-dysphoria). For people with a feminine brain, male hormones can cause severe mental health effects. And vice versa - if you give HRT to someone with a masculine brain, it may \\*create\\* those problems! Also, not everyone gets it, so your son may not be affected at all. If it sounds like this is something you want to test, it should be possible to try HRT for a short time to see what the mental effects are. 1 to 2 months should not be long enough for significant permanent effects (breast growth) to take place - and if by chance they do begin he can stop immediately. None of this may even apply to your son - but just in case it does, it's worth being aware that it's a possibility!"

But it does not block your T production - in fact, your body starts producing more trying to compensate for perceived T shortage. Because bi doesn't cross blood-brain barrier to well, your brain is still exposed to T, preventing behavioral changes - you are still as horny, and manly as ever. (For the first few days after T levels rise, but before your brain gets used to it - even more than usual.) And because excess T metabolizes to E, among other things, and your body can‚Äôt access T, it alone is enough to start slowly feminize your body (but not brain). But no access to T, and low level of E are not good for you. It can cause low energy and osteoporosis, among other things.\n\nHere comes the Raloxifene - it's a type of SERM, strengthening effects of E on your body (but not brain), weakening effects on breast (so no boobs), and preventing osteoporosis and other negative health effects. That solves most of the problems, but such high levels of T mean most of it gets turned into other T metabolite, DHT, which can lead to baldness, and no one wants to be a bald femboy.\n\nSo you add cyproterone, which is another T blocker, this time blocking T production. Normally it would just make it so there's no T in your body, but in combination with bi, it just brings your levels down enough to curb DHT production. That solves balding, but using cyp sometimes cause depression-like effects. This is prevented via B12.\n\nUpshot - you end up with manly, T steeped brain in feminine, E shaped body."

You may think he's \"not trans\" but he'd likely fall somewhere under the nonbinary umbrella. Some could consider femboy itself to be a nonbinary identity. Being nonbinary doesn't mean he will want to go all the way to female later--some people do, but I'm 40 and I'm still nonbinary.\n\nHRT won't necessarily stop erections, but if it does there's Cialis, or adding in a bit of testosterone gel or something.\n\nMood changes can be unpredictable. Many people who are on the trans spectrum feel that HRT improves their mental health. This is not universal of course--and sometimes the anti-androgens themselves have mental health side effects, if he experiences those it might be worth trying a different anti-androgen less commonly prescribed, like bicalutamide. Nonbinary people can benefit mentally from HRT too--I did.\n\nMental effects of feminizing HRT tend to make the person more in tune with their emotions, and can make emotions more intense. (Also increased empathy and intuition, and feelings of clarity, reduced brainfog, reduced dissociation, increased ability to cry, and peace have been reported.) Sometimes the more intense emotions can be a bit of a rollercoaster, but people usually feel that it's good that they're finally feeling their feelings and feeling connected to their bodies and identities, and that they're dealing with and processing things that may have been bothering them for a long time but they were unable to articulate. Of course there's no guarantee any of this will happen--some people just feel exactly the same.\n\nYou have to understand too that endogenous sex hormones and endogenous puberty are not neutral states, and those can in themselves negatively impact mental health. One of the worst things for my own mental health is the sex hormones my body naturally wants to make.\n\nBut if he finds he hates how HRT makes him feel, he can always change something about how he's taking it (change dose, use a different anti-androgen or forego the anti-androgen) or stop taking it entirely."

It doesn't happen.  Every time someone is charged with molesting women or kids in supposedly safe spaces, it's always a church leader, politician, scout leader, or a relative."

I don't \"hate\" the things I am phobic of. If there is anything about it that I hate, its the phobias themselves, not the subjects of them. I don't think most people with phobias of high places want all buildings limited to two stories.\n\nPeople with irrational fears are usually fully aware they are irrational and would rather not have phobias at all. They may seek therapy to relieve themselves of their phobias, especially if they cause them to feel unsafe in every day scenarios. \n\nPeople with irrational hate, though, are often eager to explain why their hatred is justified, usually by citing some irrational fear about the subject. That we use the word phobia to describe both of these feels like an injustice to the subjects of irrational hate."

I didn‚Äôt feel the sisterhood. I know this is not exclusive of all trans women and biological women can also behave like this. But my experience was shaped by the trauma and I began comparing myself to them. Felt inadequate. And I felt fear and shame. Fear led to rejection and I am now questioning where I stand, because I know it‚Äôs not their fault. I also feel resentment because I feel like I‚Äôm not feminine enough, beautiful enough or attractive enough next the beauty they have, but I that has more to do with my self-esteem and insecurities and the fact that I‚Äôm comparing myself to them in the first place.

Not only is it super blue, but our new governor, who, as attorney general, sued the former president over 100 times in his last term, has said he will do everything in his power to protect the rights of our state, including trans rights.\n\nThen we have a law here that requires insurance companies to cover trans healthcare. I could be wrong, but I don't know of any other state or area that does that.  Like, FFS covered, bottom surgery covered, vocal cord surgery covered‚Äîpretty much all surgeries are covered. Some I didn't even know about (I have Premera Blue Cross, for those wondering). HRT is covered, too. For any of those surgeries, my maximum out-of-pocket cost for a calendar year is $4,500. So, depending on how much recovery time I can manage, I could do all the surgeries in one year and only pay $4,500.\n\nThat's a value I can't get over when looking at my state. Trans healthcare coverage is awesome.\n\nThe cities are pretty safe, too. Check out Bellingham for a cheaper alternative to Seattle."

There are some central states like CO which have pretty good protections, but they're more isolated. Idk how much of a difference that's going to make in the next 4 years.\n\nCost is a problem. Even in blue states, cities are usually the bluest parts, and rural areas can lean red. There are some exceptions (western MA comes to mind, it's rural and very blue), but that's the trend. NM is one of the less expensive blue states, and it has the advantage of bordering on CA and also on Mexico. But in terms of political power it isn't the strongest."

The legal protections, the availability of medical care, the numerous places and people you can reach out to, but most importantly just how normal it is. When my partner came out I had numerous trans coworkers I could talk to. When she came out to her conservative boss, he just said shrugged and said he didn't care as long as her work didn't suffer. She was able to come out into a space that not only supported her when she was feeling self conscious, but did highlight her. She could just be her normal self, not an icon of hope or progress, not a child stealing deviant, not a rainbow flag wearing warrior, she was allowed to just be herself and figure out what she liked/wanted. This ability to just be normal shouldn't be understated, and I think it's been a huge difference maker for her transition, both in how happy she is, but also how confident. She didn't need to embrace any identity or label other than what she's chosen. \nAlso for the cis partner (myself) it's also been great. I didn't have to deal with any sudden bigotry/hatred bc I'm dating a trans person. Heck most people I told early on were very supportive and happy. If a person is in a relationship, ESPECIALLY if there's kids involved, it can be critical that your in a location that won't villianize your entire family. No one should be forced to choose between their partner and their entire family/support system. No child should deal with sudden shame and ridicule bc their parent is trans. Partners and children need support too, so it's important to be in a place that can provide this."

So you have people from a do not travel state in your state and that is also an added risk. I love Western Washington, and that is desperately where I would like to go, but as I am being priced out of Spokane and experiencing increasing hostility as a trans man we need to be specific.\n\nI‚Äôm actually trying to move to Northern California which while still very red there‚Äôs more social support for me with family and friends.

Yeah, the central valley and Shasta area are socially terrifying. But the North Coast is really nice. And conversely, a lot of richer suburbs in the Bay Area and broad LA metro are where I feel the *least* safe- this is where you get neolib nimbys. I've seen pearl clutching mothers trying to hide their children from me, cops glare at me and follow me, had people call me slurs to my face, and just a general feeling of unease in these areas.\n\nIt's a very washed down, indirect hostility, which is a bit nerve wracking because it makes it harder to pin down who is completely safe or not.\n\nBut yes, I agree, and the state government is very sympathetic. However, I do fear that the general neoliberal sentiment will trend towards \"why are we wasting so much effort protecting these people\". \n\nI'm rambling, but you're still right.

    "comment_body": "People are taught to hate us, because it benefits patriarchy.\n\nThere's nothing natural or invincible about the gender hierarchy patriarchy is constructed from, and like any hierarchy it has to be forcefully instilled and maintained. And because it's built, it has to be constantly reinforced to continue existing. Patriarchy isn't like the Sun or a mountain, it's like money and language, a mutable socially constructed system. It's the reification that makes it 'real' in the sense of affecting people's lives.\n\nSo people are taught to maintain it, to reflexively hate, fear, and be disgusted by things that undermine it, and are materially rewarded for that reification of patriarchy.\n\nA man who participates in misogyny with his friends is rewarded with acceptance as a man, whereas if he pushes back against the misogyny of his friends, clearly there's something wrong with him. He must be gay, or 'woke', or otherwise tainted and incapable of being a 'real' man under patriarchy. By rejecting the power he is given to harm women, he undermines the idea that the power is natural or good.\n\nIn a similar way, someone who supports and loves trans people faces pushback to maintain the hierarchy. If we're loved, accepted, and treated equally, then the hierarchy that treats cis people as human and trans people as subhuman is clearly wrong and unjustifiable.\n\nAccepting us threatens the hierarchy, and by doing so it threatens the power that cis people hold, and that men hold. They stand to make money grifting against us and appealing to the reflexive disgust people are taught. They can feel powerful by stepping on us and exerting the power granted to them under cisheteropatriarchy.\n\nFor cis men, exertion of power over trans people is even more free of consequence than doing it to a cis woman because we are valued less by society. For cis women, trans people are a gender category they can exert power over. This then interacts with misogyny, because cis women can exert structural power over trans women through transmisogyny.\n\nFor transmasculine people, all this forms a 'regendering' force, attempting to push them into detransition and back into their position within the cis gender hierarchy as coercively assigned to them at birth. Hence all the fearmongering about 'fertility', the infantalisation, and why transmasc 'detransitioners' are especially useful to transphobic movements. It's an attempt to push transmascs back into the category of 'reproductive vessel', to maintain patrilineality, property, and patriarchy.\n\nTransfeminine people, meanwhile, face a 'degendering' force, hence the difference in rhetoric. By transitioning, we show patriarchy is a lie, that maleness is not superior, and that the power it offers is not aspirational, natural, or just. We can't be reassimilated into patriarchy through the closet, not really. We're displaced into a third gender/sex category instead, the lowest gender category because of the nature of transmisogyny; all transmisogyny exempt people can shield themselves from structural/institutional transmisogyny even if they do face transphobia, and all of them can wield transmisogyny to their benefit over transfeminine people. Trans women are an acceptable outlet for gendered violence to even the most extreme degree because we can't be what patriarchy demands a 'woman' to be. If we can be women *and* free *without* being a reproductive vessel for a man, then cis women can be too, and patriarchy would crumple.\n\nFundamentally, trans people undermine the patriarchy in subtly distinct ways by coming out and transitioning, and this intersects with other social hierarchies too. These hierarchies are a house of cards, and we shake the foundation of it in a way that frightens a lot of cis people, because in order to accept us they'd have to pull out the foundation and topple the house of cards and that makes so much of their own life uncertain and complicated when they want it to be simple.\n\nLike many other reactionaries, transphobia is an attempt to make the world simpler, because the beautiful complexity and blurriness of everything frightens them and threatens their worldview.\n\nSo really, that's why they hate us. We show the lie and the artificiality of patriarchy in an undeniable way; we show the malleability of body, gender, and sex; we materially threaten the hierarchy if we are accepted, which would cost people power they benefit from; and we push at the part of the brain that thinks 'what if?'.\n\nI feel afraid too, but doomscrolling really doesn't help. Once you've seen how colourful and vibrant and complicated the world is, you can't go back, even if you try to recloset yourself. You've seen the house of cards, you know how brittle it is, and you know how wild and freeing self-determination is.\n\nIt's worth it, even though it's scary, and even though it's difficult. I think it's better to see the world clearly and fully enjoy the good parts, rather than sleepwalk through it trying to hide from the bad."

That you no longer stay in some mental box they got taught while younger and now they have to treat you like an individual.\n\nAnd they don't like that, because it requires empathy and effort, without knowing what benefit they get from it for themselves. They don't get why you'ld want be a different gender, because *they* don't want that, and they are incapable of separating their personal opinions from social norms.\n\nPlus, for some among them, it's a mental need to hate some kind of group, any group, as outlet to vent their personal issues."

I lived in Va and Fla during that time and never had any issues with medical providers or others I told that I was trans. I‚Äôm very worried about this now.  \n\nSo why do people hate us?  I see three main reasons:\n\n1.\t‚Å†Certain Christian denominations have become **obsessed with the Old Testament** and are teaching their faithful that trans people are sinners defying God‚Äôs plan for our lives (and the country is suffering from God‚Äôs displeasure).¬†There is so much theologically wrong with this, but I‚Äôll just summarize it saying this viewpoint ignores Christ‚Äôs actual teachings.  Their hate also makes them feel powerful and righteous. (No doubt like the men Jesus stopped from stoning the woman.)\n\n2.\t‚Å†Many people gravitate to conservative political beliefs because they fear social change and they **find comfort in a worldview** that rejects modernity in favor of an idealized past. These people **cannot accept that someone can change their physical sex.**¬†Ironically, TERFs have an associated worldview where they derive their personal worth from an identity rooted in being AFAB and fear/hate anyone not AMAB.  To retain this self-worth, they must ideologically reject anyone not AFAB and they see transfems as males. Like conservatives, their fear powers their hate.\n\n3.\t‚Å†Finally, Republican politicians **needed an issue** to bring religious right voters out to the polls after Roe was overturned by the Supreme Court.¬†They also found that political ads about trans girls in girls sports played well with a small group of suburban moms.  That‚Äôs why the ads featured hulking shadowy images looming over little girls.\n\nI think fear of us we might also be influenced by a fear / rejection of science among many people.  Our care is science-based, so the haters must undermine that science. This is why we see them focus on the detransitioners and promoting their stories.\n\nI believe future social scientists will study this era and the propaganda targeting us because it is both effective and based on easily identifiable lies.¬†\n\nWe‚Äôve seen hate directed at minorities before in global history. It has been worse before and it could get a lot worse for us before it‚Äôs over. Fortunately, it‚Äôs actually hard to sustain hatred. It exhausts you. And the propagandists must constantly work to maintain it. Ultimately, this hatred will burn itself out. People will see the truth about us.¬†\n\nOne more thing‚Ä¶ while we have to be concerned about potential legislation being introduced in Congress and state legislatures, only a fraction of those bills will ever pass into law. And any law that is passed can be undone by a future legislature.  They are a serious concern, but don‚Äôt obsess over them. Most of them are just politicians posturing.  Let‚Äôs work with our allies to deal with the few of them that actually move forward and become a real threat."

How it was said was the hate and pushback from religious/conservative/far-right individuals and groups, in their eyes, is a lack of subtlety by the younger/newer generations of individuals in these communities, they are \"very flashy\", \"in your face\", and often times \"overly-vocal\" and not willing to communicate or find common ground. There were multiple articles/videos of them(the older generations of LGBTQ+ individuals) talking about \"they're just too much versus us old-schoolers\", a lot of them also blamed social media, etc."

Men are meant to be dominant and  strong, make all the decisions in the household and the world at large, and pay little mind to such feeble thing like emotions. Society doesn't want you to stray away from these rigid roles. They don't want you to decide who you're meant to be, youre meant to follow them no matter what. So when a person decides to change their gender they reject those roles given to them by others, it takes back control into their hands,  so to change your gender is to radically take back control that society doesn't want you to have, and that pisses people off. \nTldr: Society wants you to be a certain way, and when you dec9de not to be, that is pisses them off"

In the UK for example while the health secretary is nothing less than a genocidaire who should be facing charges of extermination in the Hague, the majority attiude of the general population ranges from supportive to apathetic.

The opposite gender, maybe?¬† Personally i don't see myself as a boy, and i don't know how others can. To me, gender means nothing. It's not like \"women think this way\" or \"men think this way\", to me gender is just a \"role\". (If you are a parent, mother or father.) I thought it was something like \"i like pink, princesses, and i like to wear make up, all my friends are girls, and i started to feel like a girl\" and \"i like soccer and blue, and my friends are boys, that means i am a boy\" because I thought that transgender people had idealized the opposite gender, damn... But honestly, it's not like I hate them. Y'all are just regular human beings, as everyone is. I don't really understand the hate on the community- but don't worry. They're all just 49yo \"straight\" blonde americans. Please, don't end yourself. Don't. There is people who care about you even if you don't realize. Don't let those motherfuckers put you down, be yourself. (I have been through rejection, it took me a long time to repair and now i feel so much better because I don't care. You can do this bud)"

And they hate the truth. Also it‚Äôs also about trans women going in female spaces and women feels uncomfortable when they‚Äôre in their spaces, how about men in female sports it‚Äôs not fair also the community keep lying about biology and science and there is a lot of delusions in there. They try to get to force people to call them something that they‚Äôre not and people don‚Äôt want to play along with the delusions, You could be trans and not part of the community if you‚Äôre trans and know that you could be better, we will still see you as a trans person. Remember people will only respect you from your actions and buy the things that you do, if you keep lying about things and keep involving children then lotta people is not gonna respect you. I seen many trans people that‚Äôs against the LGBTQ community because they realize what the things that they‚Äôre doing, just because you‚Äôre trans does not mean you have to be labeled LGBTQ or you be a part of the community just because there‚Äôs people like you doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be just like them use your own head, just because they‚Äôre just like you doesn‚Äôt mean you have to listen to them everything that they say. just tell the truth and stop involving children and hold the people in your community accountable for they‚Äôre actions and you will get the respect that you wanted. I know there are haters out there, i‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not but the people who keeps telling you the reason why they hate you is because your existence because you‚Äôre trans are lying to you because they trying to feed victim mentality inside of you. Trans people been out there for a long time like at the 80s maybe the 70s and I don‚Äôt think anybody hated them just because they exist the reason why everything is getting so negative in modern generation right now is because the things is people that called them selves trans are messing everything up for other tran people, The LGBTQ community is making trans people look bad and that‚Äôs why people see a lot of trans people no different from the other it‚Äôs because what the TQ community has done, bad actions can affect the future, affect how people think of you, if you‚Äôre not one of them but still trans you have to blame the people who made you look bad who claimed that they‚Äôre trans. People are taught to hate and it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre different from other people just be yourself and ignore the haters, but you also have to understand why they ate the community. That‚Äôs all."

I'm anti social as it is and i believe respect is earned not automatic so excuse us for not being cooperative to change our dialogue to suit your pronouns like bro we just met I don't give a fuck. To me if you are confused on your gender and are considering genital mutilation to feel happy, im sorry but that's a mental illness, if you can't accept yourself how can we? I really don't like your woke flag or any other flag that isn't the flag of the United states. Don't act like being trans is a big deal or makes you better than any other person, i mean sure im happy for you now keep it to yourself. To me transsexuals are creepy because it's pretty much a pervert conversation, just like gay people it's okay when you keep in the bedroom but nobody likes a loud and proud flamer gay. I hate how you expect more rights like your something else than human, like dude we already have rights and laws you ain't in shackles picking cotton, function in society and keep your personal shit personal, imagine if you had a friend who had a scat kink constantly talking about all the shit he ate, i mean he's not hurting anyone but nobody cares or wants to hear it, see the comparison? Keep it out of schools! Keep it out of politics! Keep your pronouns to yourself until you've put in the time to build a relationship with the person and have mutual understanding with that person before asking them to use different words. But for the love of god don't try to convince us that your a different gender than you were born with we really don't care, let me have my opinions and don't argue. I hope this helps you understand."

This really gives incel vibes; making worldviews with unsubstantiated claims could potentially harm your wellbeing.\n\nA much simpler and probably a way more verifiable reason is that people inherit the hate against transgender community from older generations. I have no idea when and why it started, but I am inclined to believe that back then anything that was different was inherently bad. The same thing still happens today to various things to a certain degree. Also, the lack of personal connections to LGBTQ+ ppl most likely prevents any empathy development, because they were taught that these people are deranged. So, many people perpetuate inherited stereotypes and arguments, never questioning the dehumanizing perspectives they've been taught"

You say yourself you have no idea when or why it started, or why things might be considered inherently bad. What motivation is there to dehumanise a group of people? What do people stand to gain by participating in and reinforcing that marginalisation? Why are these stereotypes and arguments perpetuated, what is their social and political purpose? Why is there so much transphobia and transmisogyny in queer and even trans communities despite their 'personal connections to LGBTQ+ people'? Why is that also true for biphobia, aphobia, and other marginalisations and prejudices in queer spaces? Hell, why is misogyny still such a problem despite about half of humanity being women and every person being raised knowing multiple women and girls? (All of these questions have answers by the way)\n\nYour 'reason' for transphobia existing is entirely vibes-based, ahistorical, and individualistic. Transphobia does not exist because individual people are taught to be mean, it is taught and reinforced because of its utility to police sexgender boundaries and to strip people of bodily/sexual autonomy. It isn't just 'for some reason people used to decide some people were inherently bad', there were indeed reasons we can talk about!\n\nUltimately, it exists for the same reasons that misogyny exists.\n\nPlease *please* read some feminist theory. None of what I said is even remotely weird if you've read any. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And maybe don't go around accusing trans women of being incels for discussing how patriarchy treats us!"

From their explanations it was like an orgasm that sort of transcended to an out of body experience. The tingling sensation is a pretty regular description that comes up and especially the feeling of it ebbing/floating away once a sub-space experience is finished.¬†I think the longest one I've witnessed lasted about 10 minutes or so?\n\nIdk if you're vanilla or not, and I certainly won't sit here and act like I have the biochemical background to say if your injection influenced anything or not, but from a relatively seasoned Domme's perspective it sounds to me like you got to experience sub-space by just talking about your partner, and that in and of itself is fucking awesome!\n\nI *highly* recommend you do some more reading on sub-space (putting 'sub-space kink' into a search engine should be a good place to start) and ultimately do some research on sub-drop (which for us girls can be extremely crippling with Dysphoria lurking around) so that you or your partner can provide adequate aftercare to avoid any nasty complications that can come right after the chemicals crash from a sub-drop.¬†\n\nSorry to nerd out on you, if you have any questions please feel free to ask!

Be cautious and check levels via blood test through your doc. Have them run tests for E1 (Estrone), E2 (Estradiol), and Testosterone. E2 is what you want for feminizing processes, E1 should be present but in a lower amount, and T should be managed.\n\nGood luck and best wishes - hopefully nothing dangerous for your health is going on."

The secret to horny is that a shocking amount of it can go on in the brain, without even being touched. Not everyone can manage a hands-free orgasm, but the only thing that matters is that you're receiving some kind of stimulation and positive feedback for the horny, and it sounds like you were on pretty hard-accelerating roll during your voice call, just hearing your own description and voice and thinking about your boyfriend. Some folks can get there just by fantasizing really intensely and squeezing their thighs together. If I'm sufficiently worked up ahead of time, my partner can just tell me to come and I'll just. Do it.\n\nIf you can do it again, it'll be a fun thing to add to your repertoire with your partner! If not, then congrats on briefly unlocking horny superpowers and enjoy the memory, I suppose."

Sometimes I fantasize a bit too much about my girlfriend during my lunch break and I can feel my face flushing and my breathing getting heavier even though I'm obviously not actually doing anything and I don't get an erection. \n\nFor me though I do definitely find it takes longer to build up, but also longer to fade away.

Being trans is not illegal.\n\nThe government will not jail you for being trans. While being trans isn‚Äôt widely socially accepted in much of the country, it's not against the law. (For context, I'm a trans woman [MtF], born and raised in China, and I've visited many times since transitioning. I do get stares, especially from older men, probably due to my height and blue hair, but most people gender me correctly.)\n\n\n2. T-based GAHT is possible, but it‚Äôs complicated.\n\nThe process is long and difficult. You need to see a psychiatrist for an evaluation and diagnosis of \"gender identity disorder\" (yes, they still call it ÊòìÊÄßÁóá). If approved, a hospital endocrinologist can prescribe testosterone.\n\n\n3. Discrimination is widespread.\n\nWhile being trans isn't illegal, the reality is tough. Finding a job can be nearly impossible if you're clocked due to your ID or presentation. Housing is also challenging, you might get evicted if your landlord discovers your identity.\n\nFor China-specific resources, may I recommend: https://ftm.wiki/zh-cn/"

Among the most oppressive countries in the world? \n\nFuck, I studied in China for 12 months. That was during the \"better\" days. 2008-09. When surveillance was still fairly slack in comparison. Homeless littered the streets, and when I asked teachers about it, they said there were no homeless. If I happened to go on a walk and point one out, they didn't acknowledge that they could see him. \n\nThere's many many more issues, and as a foreigner I could stand on the outside, as someone with money, I bribed my way around. Corruption is rampant.\n\nBrainwashed to the T. It scared the living fuck out of me and you want to live there, willingly?

I have easy, reliable, and quick access to the medications I need.\n\nAre things perfectly safe and happy for trans people here? No. Legal representation is not clearly defined, and discrimination can certainly happen, but does it? Not really, at least not in my experience. I have lived here for nine years, and while I have never encountered another trans person that I know of, I follow several on social media platforms, and they seem to be thriving. I feel safe dressing up and going out. I don't want to move out of China if i can help it.\n\nIn my experience, China tends to leave you alone if you don't make a big deal about it.

Frequently, Asians in Asia don‚Äôt mind because they see it as people taking interest in their culture. They probably haven‚Äôt had to deal with being a racial minority, or been forced to interact with someone who has a fetishistic view of their culture. \n\nBut people of Asian descent living in the West do experience being a racial minority. We see our culture being devalued, and experience racial oppression in general. We frequently run into people who fetishize our cultures, and act disrespectfully to us on that basis. So when we see a non-Asian person, especially a white person, adopt an Asian name, we see someone using one our cultures to identify themselves without having to deal with the oppression that we face. It seems disrespectful, like they‚Äôre making light of us. \n\nI don‚Äôt think that anyone should have the power to prevent people from picking the names they want. If a white person introduces themselves to me with a Japanese name, I'll call them that name. But I will also be wary of them, be on the alert for any fetishization, and avoid becoming their friend. Because not every non-Asian person who adopts an Asian name is racist, but enough are that I want to avoid it if possible. And yes, an anime name in particular would really make me roll my eyes into the stratosphere and avoid you. \n\nSo name yourself whatever you want, but be ready to accept the consequences of people thinking you might be racist. \n\nEdit: Do you speak Japanese? Do you know anything about Japanese history or culture? I don't like the appropriation/appreciation framework, but it doesn't seem like you're actually appreciating Japanese culture so much as you like this particular character."

Born and partially raised there, partly in the US. I would say that it makes me a bit uncomfortable when someone who is not at least partially Japanese has a Japanese name, especially when it's based on anime. (I have a whole thing on people seeing my culture basically reduced to anime).\n\nA couple exceptions I would have is if you just happened to be born and raised there or if you are of Japanese descent.\n\nI would also say, when I do meet someone who chose a Japanese name based on anime, it brings up uncomfortable feelings for me or them feeling uncomfortable around me. I have talked to a few other MtF's at the clinic who did pick Japanese names and I am always interested in find another Japanese trans person (which I have only met a couple). It hurts that the only thing that they know about my culture is anime and nothing else, never visited, learned the culture, or spoke the language.\n\nThat all being said, my thoughts are based on MY experiences and how I feel about naming and retaining my culture, but regardless of that, most Japanese people will not care at all. You will just get the \"oh\" with them thinking that's odd, but they will not care. I would probably refrain from saying the why you picked the name portion and it's fine. You do not have obligation to justify why you picked your name, just go for it I guess. You do you, but you will have people who question it and find it, not in good taste. I personally still don't like it and I find it cringy, but it's not like I can stop anyone or can tell anyone how to think. I also feel that you kind of understand that it is appropriation and an issue, but you want a validation to keep it. This isn't an approval to keep the name, but I would just say that if you do, please just be respectful."

People saying it's racist need to get over themselves. Just don't walk around calling yourself Japanese. It's practically like telling you not to learn another language because you're appropriating Spanish now, and heaven forbid you become an interpreter lest you start making money of another culture.\n\nMy friend's daughter's name is literally just 2 letters and they're both vowels. Names are just names, and again if it really concerns you then just go with the 1 vowel difference then boom it's your culture now, no need to have people call you something completely new."

So you risk missing out on opportunities when the opportunity would require the person offering it to judge you based on your name (i.e. job opportunities).\n\nThat's not to say it _will_ happen, just that it could. I think pronounceability probably plays a big role in those determinations as well, and certainly the acceptance of some cultures over other cultures within your own country probably factors in, too. For example, the UK is far more discriminatory towards someone with a Polish sounding name than they would be towards someone with a Spanish sounding name."

Of course Asian people living in homogenous Asia says it's ok. They DONT experience the racism Westernized Asian folks experience. \n\n\nThe uncomfortability and appropriation stems from racist history that ASIAN FOLKS IN WESTERN COUNTRY FACE.\n\nPrimarily the fact that sooo many Asian folks are bullied and discriminated against BECAUSE OF THEIR NAME.\n\n\nThen to see a group who historically marginalized us- suddenly take our names now that Anime and East Asian culture is 'cool' is what makes this uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nAnd DONT LINK OUR BEHAVIOUR  to Asian folks in Asia. They DONT experience this racism so OF COURSE they dont care. \n\n\nTHIS IS IN FACT- Another form of racism that gets perpetuated to folks like Asian Americans. It's termed Forever Foreigner Stereotype.\n\n\nThis is when people do NOT differentiate Asian folks from their 'place of orgin' and why so many people think bringing in Asian folks from Asia is appropriate in this conversation. \n\n\nIts why you sometimes see people walk up to random Asian folks and saying shit like Nihao or Konichiwa. Because they see our skin color and expect us to be foreigners.\n\n\n2.) \"Well Asians take our names hurr durr\"\n\n\nYes because again, we're EXPECTED TO CONFORM. You can't punch somone, have them fight back, then turn around and say that you were defending yourself. \n\nLots of Asian folks on America for example, take English names because it lessens discrimination.\n\n\nITS ALSO RACIST TO EXPECT ASIANS TO HAVE ASIAN NAMES.\n\nHistorically places like Vietnam has naturally Westernized names becuase of COLONIALISM.\nThat Vietnamese Emily was born with the name Emily because they were heavily colonized by France for years.\n\nAsian Emily's name can be Emily. \n\n\nTLDR; \n\n\n\nAre you planning/ living in Japan or have some connection to this culture other than 'I watched an Anime'? \n\n\nSure, appreciate and take on their culture in that case.\n\n\nAre you in bumfuck Alabama taking a name from Anime without any further context or connection?\n\n\nThat's weird, cringy, and appropriative.\n\n\n\nIt's also racist because there's a shitload of racism baked into this discourse for above reasons. You have people who directly experience this telling you it makes them uncomfortable. \n\n\n\n\nMy 2 cents.\n\n\n\"I got it from an Anime character when I was 13\"\n\nIs cringe and appropriative. ESPECIALLY if you could have tweeked this name to fit your own culture."

My birth named, which legally I now have as the feminine version, is, like Scandinavian. Literally nobody bats an eye at the name. In fact, I think people sometimes assume I‚Äôm white (despite brown skin) because of my very white sounding name. \n\nWhat I don‚Äôt like about people claiming that using a Japanese chosen name is cultural appropriation is that it‚Äôs considered true for all names except white sounding ones. It makes it sound like white is the default. \n\nI knew two people in high school who were both half-Japanese. One of them had a white name (technically Irish)and the other had a Japanese name. Literally nobody seemed to care or make a big deal about it (granted this was well before cultural appropriation as a term entered common use). Unless you are hyper observant about these things, you‚Äôd never tell either of there were at all Japanese specifically. \n\nAnd what if a couple had a child and wanted to name them after a Japanese mentor who both personally meant a lot to them. Like, let‚Äôs say Masahiro Mifune, a Japanese- American lawyer helped saved a couple‚Äôs live and this non-Japanese couple wanted to honor him by naming their son after him. Are they not allowed to because his name isn‚Äôt white sounding enough? If his name was Daniel Johnson, there would be zero issues with naming the child Daniel, but there‚Äôs an issue with Masahiro? \n\nIn short, choose a name that is meaningful to you.\n\nSincerely, a non-Scandinavian or Greek woman with a Scandinavian legal name and a Greek inspired preferred nickname."

Even with a perfect passing, why choose another property that will raise questions as well as eye brows? I guess you might say the same about my blue hair... But I'd rather be stared at because of my hair, piercings or tattoos, which will possibly deter people from other bodily features (and they tend to either compliment it or say nothing at all), than for having my gender questioned. Having to spell or explain my name from a very different culture over and over again... The thought alone induces my anxiety!\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is just what I'm genuinely feeling, and I'm in no place to tell anyone how to live their life. But I really hope you're mentally equipped for handling the consequences that may come from such a decision."

    "comment_body": "I think it depends a lot on intent. I know quite a few white people with other culture's names, especially Japanese names, so i'd say it's not. It's getting to be a fairly common thing. If you like your name, keep it. Reddit is a terrible place to ask things like this, as 98% of the people on here are either SJWs or hardcore racist transphobes, and don't actually base their answers on real life.\n\nThe people saying it's cultural appropriation clearly don't actually know much about the real world, because a majority of Japanese people, and people generally, outside of Reddit, do not care. The most you may ever get is some weird looks.(Japanese here, born in Japan moved to America, because I know its going to be asked.) In fact, if it's well educated and you know the name's meaning, that's a lot more than most Japanese people expect when a white person says they have a name from our culture.\n\nPersonally I think the concept of a name being \"cultural appropriation\" is rather asinine. People have been mixing and matching names from other cultures for a very, very long time, before this generation cropped up and decided that it was \"appropriation.\" If they wouldn't care if they saw a Japanese person with a white name, but care if a white person has a Japanese name, then they are quite honestly just racist, and they are the minority, not the majority.\n\nTL;DR: your name is fine, keep it, and you'd be better off asking questions like this on an app/website that has more people that actually live in the real world, and Reddit is not that. Most people in real life are not going to care. The most you will ever get is some weird looks."

It frustrates me to see a name from my culture on a white person specifically only if they are mispronouncing it, and/or are saying it means something it *absolutely does not* (because there is a *lot* of misinformation on the internet about the meanings of names). \n\nI'll use Tara as an example. I have never met a white Tara who pronounces their own name correctly. The main reason for this is because the T sound in the Sanskrit word Tara doesn't *exist* in English. People who speak only English are *incapable* of pronouncing it correctly because they never learned to make the correct sound. It upsets me even more when they pronounce it tay-ruh because that is ruining both syllables. Those are not the sounds in that name. If you are *sure* you're using it correctly, then I think it can *potentially* be okay but very frequently white people end up misusing names from other cultures, which is *not* fine.\n\nAs an example of the second thing, online you'll find a lot of sources saying that in its Sanskrit/Hindu roots, the name maya means \"illusion\". That is simply just not true. The word Maya is the literal translation for \"love\". Yet none of these online sources ever mention that at all.\n\nEdit: I'm specifically talking about Tara's who have said to me or in front of me that their name is the Sanskrit word for star. I do try to make sure I'm not getting upset about a misunderstanding"

    "comment_body": "Hi! I used to live in Japan, and I've had this conversation hundreds of times with people of different ages and backgrounds while I lived there. Why? Because I'm white, and my name is Maki. (Well, it was a nickname back then, but not many people knew my legal name, and those who did, didn't use it.)\n\nI started using the name as a kid (long background story I won't go into) when I knew next to nothing about Japan (I never really watched anime nor read manga, and I'm not a gamer.) I wrote it \"Mackie\" back then. The origin of my name is the diminutive of Mackenzie and I chose it because it's gender-neutral (I'm genderqueer), and I preferred shorter names.\n\nHowever, I'm French-Canadian, and in French most names that end in \"ie\" are girls' names, so when I realized that, I started writing it differently. At first, I wrote it \"Makki\", but during my first stay in Japan, someone told me that in Japanese, it was a word with very negative meanings such as \"terminal\" (disease/cancer, etc...) and \"end-of-life\" (care, decisions, etc.) and suggested that I write it \"Maki\" instead.\n\nDuring my time in Japan (2006, 2010-2015), I've asked almost every person I've met if they thought it was inappropriate of me to write it this way and if they would have the same opinion if it became my legal name. I begged people to give me their genuine opinion and not say something nice out of politeness (since it's part of the culture to tell white lies, google \"tatemae\" if you want more info.) I've asked people of all ages, and backgrounds, living in different areas of the country, etc. The oldest Japanese person I've asked was close to 90 years old, was from a rural area, and worked on a historical site.\n\nNOT ONE PERSON SAID IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. Most were curious, excited, and honored that I chose a nickname that looked/sounded Japanese, and they even encouraged me to make it legal.\n\nThe Japanese family I lived with (a couple in their 70s, their daughter and grandson who were about 35 and 10) even showed me different ways the name could be written in kanji and suggested that I pick specific ones (that are a bit uncommon) for my hanko (a stamp that people use instead of signing their name when they receive mail, at the bank, etc... you can use any name, it doesn't necessarily have to be your legal name, as long as you always keep the same one.) I DIDN'T do it, though. But the fact that they suggested it tells you a lot.\n\nAt my school, all the teachers and staff started calling me Maki as soon as they heard that it was my nickname, even though they knew my legal name and I never asked them to call me Maki. (And I wasn't out as trans to most people back then.) One Japanese girl I met who lived in Sweden and visited Finland told me that it was a Finnish name too (I'm not sure if it's a first name though, I know there's a last name spelled \"M√§ki\".)\n\nThe fact that I spoke Japanese, was well-mannered, and intended to live there my entire life (I, unfortunately, had to leave in 2015 due to major health issues and later on my dad got diagnosed with dementia), and that some people knew my mom practiced Buddhism for a while, etc... obviously might've played in my favor. Also, some people I've asked knew the name originated from \"Mackenzie/Mackie\" so my situation differs from yours.\n\nI never experienced any problems in Japan. However, ONCE a white person from North America who I was acquainted with on social media (and who I believe didn't like me/get my auDHD way of communicating) ranted at me. I admired that person, and they were so cold and made me feel so bad that I considered changing my name again for a while. (I ended up not doing it because my Japanese friends told me it would be silly to change it just because that one white person yelled at me and also a lot of trouble, plus I had paid $550 CAD to change it the first time.) But that's my only negative experience. I also met a French-Canadian woman in her 60s named Maki.\n\nIt's not my place to tell you whether it's right or wrong (especially since I'm not Japanese, and don't know enough about you and the name in question) but I hope my experience will help.\n\n*Edited: for clarity, typos, and lemurs... lol*\n\nPS: I forgot to mention that in French, \"Maki\" is also the name for[ ring-tailed lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-tailed_lemur). üòç\n\n# Edit #2: OnionsOverload pointed out something important [in a comment tagging me](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1h7zwxu/comment/m0qoath/), please read it. I've also replied. I apologize for not focusing on the right thing."

You are not picking the name to mock the culture, are you? You are picking it because it deeply resonates with you and you respect it. No normal person will be offended by someone respecting their culture. Would you be offended when a Japanese person LOVES the name Jonathan because it deeply resonated with them, so they wanted to use it?\n\nIt is closer to cultural appreciation, or rather just cultural exchange. As someone from Europe it is beautiful to see effects of different cultures on our names and other traditions/values."

Most of the answers always disappoint me.\n\nOP, let me get one thing out of the way first: if it's not racist for an Asian person to use a western name, then it is also not racist for a white person to have an Asian name. It's not uncommon for westerners who live in an Asian country to choose an Asian name, either. We live in a connected world. The words cultural appropriation is utterly stupid. Culture, at least the positive aspects, is meant to be shared and will inevitably spread by various ways. This is even more true today. Halloween? Christmas? Lunar New Year? What's a name to worry about? I am not Japanese, but my response applies to all non-Asians wishing to take an Asian name. I've had this discussion before, so let me tell you.\n\nI was born and raised in Vietnam. It's not uncommon for a Vietnamese person to take a non-Vietnamese name, either as nickname, stage name, or even legal name, just because they like it. They most likely have an interest in the culture where that name came from. It does make some people raise eyebrows, but no where near the amount of backlash like this. If I meet a white person, and they have a Vietnamese name, I'd be even more interested in getting to know this person. Of course, provided they are a decent person and not some weirdo.\n\nYou know who else thinks like I do? My family. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc. My friends. They live in Vietnam. When I ask if they ever find it offensive, they just give a confused response. These people live and are surrounded in Vietnamese culture nearly 24/7.\n\nUnfortunately, many of my fellow Vietnamese Americans don't feel the same way. Naturalized VA might feel indifferent about it, mostly. But those who were born here, and raised in American culture, tend to be vehemently against the idea. And let me tell you what I observed from many of them: the majority of them can barely string together a coherent sentence in Vietnamese. They barely know our history. They barely know our culture. They are American, first and foremost, then Vietnamese second or third or fourth. I am not saying that their opinions should be dismissed. However, why should their opinions have more value than mine? My family's? My friends'? Or the majority of the people in Vietnam? Most do not give a crap if some white person chooses a Viet name."

Different cultures pronounce stuff differently. If a person's name is written as Tara and pronounced /Tayruh/, **that is how they were named** \\- that is the correct prononciation used to name themselves. It's effectively a different name. You are the one incorrectly pronouncing their name in a way they were NEVER named.\n\nSpoken language is what matters, not how it's written. The inspiration for the name may have come from your culture **or not**. But it's irrelevant anyway, because the person's name is not being used in your culture anyway.\n\nAlso why are you trying so hard to prove what roots a name has, or what it means? Every culture decides this for themselves. Language, after all, evolves and there are many words that cultures share amongst each other and can mean totally different things... Things one culture gets from another, can evolve separately into something completely new. That's how it is, and you seem to be strongly opposed to it? Stop with this cultural elitism, like you own a word or name. Or is this how you want the world to be? Every culture criticizing others for doing something differently? And fighting to prove what they own.... it's tiring."

    "comment_body": "But the majority of these people are not on reddit! Some might hang out on r/Vietnam, but reddit is not a popular site in Vietnam. So, when you ask a question like \"can a white man have a Viet name\", especially on a trans sub, 9/10 answers will be from Viet Americans who most likely will be against it. You are not getting the answers from a lot more other people who just don't care at all. If you go to Japan, and ask if it's rude for a white person to use a Japanese name, I bet you would get mostly indifferent responses. I actually recall watching a video of someone asking Japanese people if they would get offended, and nearly all said they don't care.\n\nWe don't need to look far. A few years back, a white girl was chastised for wearing a Chinese dress to prom. Bunch of idiots harassed her for appropriating another culture. Chinese people were interviewed, and they didn't give a crap, or even complimented her. That's the difference between someone who touches grass and a bunch of terminally online weirdos. It seems like this whole culture appropriation is just out of control in the US mainly.\n\nIt's not uncommon for trans people to choose their new name taken from a fictional character they adore. Many trans women choose the name Lara/Laura, from Laura Croft from Tomb Raider. I missed the part where you can only choose white characters' name. I, as an Asian trans woman, choose the name of a character from a JRPG. Apparently, her name originates from Poland. I am as Polish as Lewandowski is Vietnamese. I doubt he, or any Polish nationalists, would be knocking on my door demanding me to change my name.\n\nThe common complain I hear from AA is that it's okay for them to take western name to avoid white people from making fun of them. White people taking Asian name is fetishizing. Uhm... If a white person hates Asians, they wouldn't be taking an Asian name. You're barking up the wrong tree. It's like smashing your keyboard because your wifi router malfunctions. And if they fetishize you, they'd just say straight up they want to fuck you. No need to change name. I've faced plenty of racism from all races in the US. Last person I'd blame is some white dude who just want an Asian name, unless he's also a racist scumbag. The worst bullshit I've seen is that some AA will stay away from a white person if they like anime or have \"anime\" name. WTF is an anime name? Goku, Naruto are fictional name. No one chooses those. Seiko? Hinata? Satoshi? Those are actual Japanese names, you fucking idiots. James Bond is a fictional character. People don't stop using the name James. And I also missed the part where white people have to quit socializing with Asians in order to watch anime. Must be some secret unspoken rules among Asian Americans that I wasn't informed of.\n\nThere's also this kind of exclusionary vibe to it. Anyone can take German, Italian, Spanish names to be American. But Asian names are automatically \"foreign\" because they don't sound American enough. It's implying that Asian names can never be accepted for an American. An Asian can choose a German name to be American. But reverse cannot happen.\n\nAs for you, OP, it would still help your case if you familiarize yourself with Japanese culture. Liking anime is step 1, cultural studying is step 2. You can use both Japanese and western name. Many Asian Americans use their western or ethnic name in different social settings. Hell, I don't see why I should limit myself to just one or two names. If I feel like, I'd find myself a Korean name, then a Chinese name. Somebody else said it'd seem less weird if you have some other connection to Japan. But really, who would be able to verify that? You can just make up a story as yo why you have a Japanese name. Your friend gave it to you before she passed away, and you take it as a memento. Or for example, you choose name Tanaka, because you want to honor your shidoshi, whose name was Tanaka. Whatever you can come up with.\n\nI know the post was too long but I said what needed to be said. I'll keep copy and paste this every time I see a thread like this."

They have no interest in the deeper culture, its people, nor do they understand that in reality, anime is a very surface level depiction of Japan in general. \n\nThe part about you being 13 is an extension of that; many young kids who like anime don‚Äôt tend to understand Japanese culture at a deeper level. You instead get kids who (many times unknowingly!) appropriate Japanese culture by giving themselves Japanese anime names, copying phrases or words (I knew a number of white kids that would say itadakimasu and claim they were Japanese), etc etc. \n\nWhile I wouldn‚Äôt say these behaviours are the majority, they certainly aren‚Äôt rare, and are especially noticeable to POC. Additionally, that isn‚Äôt to say you personally partook in these behaviours! However, all of these reasons I‚Äôve listed become associated with the choice in a white person choosing a Japanese name. With the context you‚Äôve given, it‚Äôs clear that you are not fetishizing Japanese culture, however, these are the connotations it may carry. I understand that you have decided to spell it the way your country would, which I agree with others is the best choice in this scenario. All the best!"

When I changed my name from a traditional Indian feminine name to an American unisex name, suddenly I started getting many more callbacks on job applications, and suddenly people stopped questioning my immigration status. So it wasn't just annoying, occasional comments. I'm glad I changed my name instead of just laughing off missed economic opportunities. But things are different in US. I know a few white people who've taken Indian names because they \"sound cool\" or \"resonate deeply with the culture\", and in each case, they experienced the opposite that I did, i.e. big dropoff in callbacks and people questioning if they were born outside the US. I don't care about so-called cultural appropriation, but if people want to willingly take on the burden of an Indian name in the US, go ahead lmao."

Do you suddenly stop benefiting from pro white racism?\n\nThe entire point of these comments is that white vs non-white is extremely Western centric and over simplistic. White people in Japan simultaneously benefit from pro-white racism and suffer from discrimination based on their race. A white person in Japan is less likely to get stopped by the police or refused an apartment than a black person in Japan, but they're also more likely to be stopped by the police or refused an apartment based on their race than a Japanese person. That's why there are white people that are part of racism related lawsuits in Japan. Do you think they need to start listening and stop talking over the non-white people? How does that work? Does the Japanese cop, who has been instructed to go crack down on foreigners, get to lecture them on pro-white racism? Huh?\n\nOf course this conversation is all very silly. We're all Westerners who have never been to Japan and are not fluent in Japanese, so we have a surface level understanding of what happens in Japan and what happens in Japan has little relevance to our lives. In that sense you actually have a point, though it would require a strict delineation between Japanese and Japanese diaspora which I would suspect you're not keen to make."

It's true that asking directly whether it's appropriation came later, my bad for that, but I very much didn't just \"pick a name that looked pretty\"."

It's a feeling.\n\nTheir intent is important: They don't select names to take away from a culture. They don't intentionally select names outside their own culture. They simply select a name they resonate with. And isn't that what an identity is all about? Something you resonate with?\n\nIt's sad to me how your first thought is them stealing your culture... instead of them liking something in your culture, and spreading it into other cultures. It's a very pessimistic approach to life.  \n\\---\n\nI see you enjoy looking down on people and mocking them if they don't immediately agree with your perspective. You also enjoy being a victim, I see. You really think I have no experience with racism, being from balkan? But then again, what would you know about balkan. You probably just see a bunch of white people here. But I'm not like you, I ain't about who is the bigger victim.\n\nIf you think someone wanting a name they want, is racism, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the word.\n\nAnd at the same time (in another thread) you assumed I was a waste of time because of my race. I experienced a lot of this stuff going around Balkan countries. People assuming someone is stupid/more likely to steal/... because of their race or nationality, it's pretty common here. I just didn't expect it to come from someone who is a self-proclaimed \"expert in racism\". Do you behave like this because white people were racist to you?"

I never said how other people should feel. If you think I did, point out where I said it. I used my experience as an example of a similar situation and explain why I think it's beautiful if cultures mix and how I believe it's appreciation.\n\nMy core issue is that many people here exclude white people from a discussion targeted at JP culture. But white people themselves can also be a part of that culture. I am not saying I AM part of that culture, I am just saying white people exist that ARE. And they are being excluded - my question has always been WHY?\n\nLet's be real now, there will ALWAYS be people offended by something, regardless of what it is. Just like transphobes being offended that we exist. I was mainly explaining that in most cultures, majority of people are not offended if someone respects their name. And from what I heard from other people in this thread, the same goes for JP people.\n\nThis is also my speculation: The only reason you feel uncomfortable is because of the anti JP racism you experienced from white people, yes? So you feel uncomfortable if a person from that race is taking something from your culture that they made fun of, right? But here is the thing... this OP was not being racist towards you. Not all white people are racists. I agree if a racist takes this name, I would feel uncomfortable too. But the OP doesn't seem like a racist to me - hence it feels fine to me. I don't ASSUME stuff based on race like you do. I just see a person liking a name.

Penguins are famous for it, where same-sex penguins will pair up and some have even stolen eggs to hatch and raise. I think there's a famous pair of gay swans in England as well. There's also a bunch of insects, reptiles, and amphibians that reproduce asexually and are all the same sex.

At least so far it hasn't been proven there's like, and observable physical component to trans identity, so without language and self awareness I don't think animals can even express gender as we mean it, at the max just roles based on sex.     \nEdit: the gender binary is very social as a concept. It's changed a lot over the millenia of human society. Native Americans recognize a third gender for example.     \nIf being trans is caused bya biochemical reason, then there's no reason to think \"born in the wrong body\" can't happen to animals outside of humans. If we're talking only about gender roles and gender in the social sense, then without language and society it's very hard for that concept to exist in aminals and if it does it's very different then how we perceived it I feel."

Hell, the most documented animal in the world is the nematode C elegans, a common lab animal. Its sexes are hermaphrodite and male. Hermaphrodites typically self fertilize, and males are exceptionally rare in nature, existing to force gene flow and crosses.\n\nAnd honestly.... even mammals and humans fall outside of the sex binary a lot of the time. binary sex is a complicated sequence of thousands of signals that generally work in coordination. But the moment you end up with any disruption to one of those signals, you get traits that seem \"mismatched\" by the binary standard- female lions with manes, male humans with breasts- that aren't even particularly rare! They're just an accepted part of the variation of the species."

Biological binaries are human shorthands for categorizing a vast array of biological phenomenon, and one of the major tasks of biological taxonomists of the past half century has been deconstructing centuries of scientists' culturally biased projections onto the biology of sex.\n\nLast but not least, humans, while obviously, not as fluid as mollusks, do, in fact, exist outside of a sexual binary.  There are XY humans who have borne children, and XX humans who have sired children.  An estimated 2% of the human population is intersex, and that number is likely higher given the impossibility of assessing exactly how many people simply don't present as such externally."

Otherwise, mammals‚Äîwhose social behaviors and emotions are more complex than reptiles and fish‚Äîare generally more rigid in their role based on their sex. \n\nBirds also exhibit complex social behaviors and relationships, but they are more closely related to reptiles with basically no relation to mammals. Their brains are capable of social and emotional complexity, but still are unique from our own. Many birds have committed and even monogamous relationships ‚Äî though without the same sexual complexity of mammals, who are more likely to engage in sex for pleasure.

Gene turnover tends to be more rigid in a monogender individual, but is more flexible in a Trans person.  I have observed this kind of gene turnover since my Male Side literally took over nearly 2 years ago.  For example, I found that the cooking habit is on the Female Side, and for a while it was turned off, which made cooking for me very difficult.  Then suddenly it turned back on again, and I'm still on the Male Side, but now I have the Female Side's ability to cook.\n\nI have also gotten gene turnover like going from an obligate carnivore practically to being able to utilize plant proteins.  I believe this is an adaptation to protect against plant poisons.  I also went from having being a very picky eater due to textural issues on my Female Side to being able to eat everything but onions on my Male Side.  There's a whole laundry list of other genetic turnover I have found during my own journey in gender.  \n\nFrom my personal experience, I don't find that there's a \"male\" or \"female\" brain so much as there is separate areas which govern certain facilities.  There's a Master Switch which appears to control the whole array, and then mini-switches underneath which control gene turnover.  Additionally I have even found a 3rd brain gender I call \"The Mother\", and this is the brain gender which causes dramatic differences in behavior in pregnant women and during PMS.  \n\nIf a man has an active Mother brain gender, he could be prone to bouts of anger and hoarding.  The Mother controls huge amounts of Progesterone, causes gene turnover related to pregnancy and babies, and can even cause some \"alien hand syndrome\" if it overlays the main personality enough.  I even felt this takeover attempt happen, and made an almost incomprehensible post on social media to prove its existence.  Women literally have got a different personality for part of PMS due to The Mother brain gender."

But the thing is, when a political party messes up, or in general, they tend to pick on a certain group of people to hate. Because, if they can bring people together to hate a certain group of people, the people brought together will start to like and vote for the party. It's sickening that parties resolve to doing it, but it is sadly very effective. It's quite visible in the UK at the moment, when the conservatives were in power, they blabed immigrants for low economic growth, and tried to deport them to Rwanda. And that was when the home secretary was an immigrant herself. And then, when that'd all failed, the next group they picked was us. Because not many people understand us, the conservatives can push misinformation against is in the media, and unite people against us. They get more votes, and they get a reason for people voting. People will believe they need to stop us, and people will vote for that. The main way of combating this, is to spread truth; if more people know the truth about  us, they will have less reason to vote for the people 'attacking' us, and the party in power will soon stop targeting us."

They should be a group that the majority of people didn't have a particularly high opinion of in the first place as a group (there aren't many Olympians or Nobel laureates, but people are generally approving of those groups and they're too small as groups anyway), even if those opinions were originally neutral. \n\nIt is then important to portray those groups as being incredibly powerful while also portraying those groups as being weak and cowardly.  This is the idea that immigrants will steal every job while also being universally lazy, for example.  Both things are obviously false and are also obviously mutually exclusive, but it's important to push both things because the enemy must be Mighty so that they're the underdog fighting for what's right, but the enemy must also be Weak so that they can't really be considered people. \n\nI think there are some other categories that those groups are supposed to fit into, but I can't remember them off the top of my head.

    "comment_body": ">I feel the issue with society is we can never progress because thier is always a side that refuses to progress.\n\nProgress is not always linear. In ancient times gay people and trans people where mostly somewhat accepted or ignored worldwide except in one tiny area. In this area a moral text that is guessed to be written 5000 BC included passages that explicitly forbid homosexuality or for a man to act like a woman. \n\nThis moral code much much later made it up north into the Roman Empire somewhere around 300 AD. Before that was common in Roman culture for higher status men to enslave lower status men as \"fuck boys\" Emperor Nero married another man for example. The same is documented for China for Emperors and high ranking officials. \n\nThen this ideology because that is one named Christianity (unlike the existence of trans people as that is not an ideology but human nature) spread across the world via European Colonialism. \n\nIn school I did not learn any of this and also not from LGBT circles. I first stumbled across this knowledge when I was in a local museum (Europe) and one of the highlights in App guide was a half a meter tall Roman Vase, standing on a pedestal, that had penises and homosexual acts all over it. Later this year in a Museum in Berlin I saw a full room of such artefacts. If these were on display at all in the decades before it definitely was not as prominent and part of the Guide. This may all change again of course...\n\nI wonder what our world would look like today if religion from this tiny area like Judaism, Christianity and Islam that shared this moral code against homosexuality would have not spread across the world. \n\nEspecially given the fact that so many primates (Bonobos, Chimpanzees, Japanese Macaques, Baboons, Gorillas and Orangutans,.. ) engage in homosexual acts so it seems it's logical to suspect that our common ancestors also did so and therefore it was later a part of human cultures across the world. Also it's harmless these species definitely did not die out from it. To me seems like the strict moral panic against this was an extreme oddity in the ancient world only present in Israel. Compared to the rest of the world¬†where the focus for high status men was mostly on make babies for the family clan but other than that have fun... \n\nThere are always people that refuses change. Christianity was seen as a thread to the Roman empire at first. It's in our nature to be somewhat resistant to new ideas. Its not just due to one trait but for example being approximately¬†16%¬†of people fall into the high openness category. Most are in the middle and also around 16 low on openness. This is believed to be 40-60% based on genes. So there will always be a fight for change because many people are open to new ideas for improving our lives but they can be silenced for a long time by an oppressive regime."

Obviously things could improve further but anyhone who lived through the 90's will tell you how much things have improved ince then.\n\nI think the same will be true for trans people. we are the current hate. but everyone sensible knows its BS and eventually the idiots will catch up with the rest of society. then the super rich will have to find another minority to rile up the easily distracted over."

Changing the tax distribution to go after the wealthy more would (or should) improve things, creating more robust social programs (universal healthcare for example) can make a massive difference, etc. On top of things like supporting workers/unions, having stronger labor protections, etc. But the republican party and their rich benefactors only have one goal, to make more money for the rich. Whether that's through tax breaks for the wealthy or killing regulations that protect workers and citizens.\n\nBut it's hard to win elections on \"Yes we know you're struggling, but we want to move the retirement age up 2 years so that Elon Musk so billionaires can pay less tax\" and \"Why would you want your child to have a better life than you, we want to have 12 year olds working at McDonalds so some investment firm can gain a point.\" Soooo instead they don't talk about their actual policies to fix issues and instead just complain about the scapegoats. \"How are you going to solve housing?\" \"Uhhhh get rid of the immigrants (despite there being no reasonable logic that makes that make sense).\"\n\nOne of the most important lessons about the rise of the Nazis was more able to happen because of the economic instability of Germany (both due to the lingering effects of WW1 and its resolution, but also the Great Depression)."

Such as the economy is always a good example the economy is never really bad but that won't stop politicians from making it sound bad so your more likely to vote for them so they try to fix a non existing issue.

There is nothing \"invalidating\" to other people about the fact that I experience sex dysphoria and that my desire was to be born female from the start and avoid the pain of dysphoria and the hardship of transition to begin with.\n\n>So because YOU wouldn't want something you are literally gonna invalidate my claim that I am happy with it?\n\nNope I just said I couldn't imagine anyone being happy with it because my experience with being trans is that I do it purely to treat an underlying condition of dysphoria, which itself is extremely agonizing. Even if the world was 100% supporting of trans people, dysphoria would still be agonizing, because I want to be female, I dont want to be male. Something in my brain, whether it be a result of genetics, epigenetics, hormone wash in the womb, whatever it is, makes my brain fundamentally incompatible and dysphoric in a male body, and this has been the case since childhood. If you dont experience this then Im happy for you. I envy you. Thats great. But for some of us this is a serious and life-threatening condition that results in a very difficult and painful life, and its not 'internalized transphobia', its just sex dysphoria which I experienced since I was 8 years old and then experienced to a far more extreme degree once puberty started causing sexually dimorphic changes to my body.\n\nIt seems like the idea that someone has a fundamentally negative experience of being trans is offensive to you because you see it as a personal indictment of some kind. It is not. Nothing about my experience in life \"invalidates\" yours. We are just fundamentally different kinds of trans people. It is interesting though that you and I can fall under the same label despite having extraordinarily opposite experiences.\n\n>You don't have to do anything or be part of this community if you do not want to\n\nI dont think it should be a requirement to celebrate or enjoy transness, or even to view it as a fundamentally positive thing to be part of a trans community. I view it the same way as a subreddit for any medical condition. I am suffering just like everyone else, and I find solace in talking to others who feel the same way."

My dysphoria is inherent to my journey as a trans person and is not caused by society.\n\nFinally, pointing out that transphobia is abnormal is actually exactly what I was doing in my previous comment.\n\nAnyways, maybe you don‚Äôt feel abnormal, which is good.

Society teaches us this. \n\nSome people say this in bad faith to pathologize transgender people by comparing our identities to a delusion or a form of self-harm. \n\nIronically, for a cisgender person, transitioning to another gender would be a form of self-harm.

That doesn't make gender dysphoria not real, but they think it can just be magically treated with therapy and/or medications like most other psychiatric conditions. Those things may help treat some of the symptoms, but cannot address the core issue. \n\nIt can be hard to explain to cis people because of the nuance involved. Gender dysphoria is either something you have or that you don't, but it's not innate. You are born transgender- which is a bold and controversial claim even among some trans people, but I firmly believe it to be true- and gender dysphoria is just the end result of that. \n\nIt's only become relatively recently accepted that sexuality is an innate characteristic. Many societies still don't see it that way, they believe being gay is a purposeful deviant choice. Gender identity has yet to catch up, and who knows when it ever will."

He insisted that as my doctor, he had a right to know.\n\nI told him it's none of his business, and his job is somewhere between my mouth and stomach and to name one good medical reason why the status of my genitals had anything to do with it. Be finally admitted he was just curious, and I told him to use Google and stop harassing me.\n\nNurses who are usually more sensitive about it and make it clear that they understand how private the question is, and usually ask for I'm OK with a very private question often find me being quite open.\n\nIt depends on how you ask. In my experience, most nurses were very respectful about it, and while I don't tell them every little detail, I will usually answer their questions, while (usually young male) doctors who insist they have a right to know usually don't get a thing out of me.\n\nNowadays, I don't tell doctors and actively hide my trans status if it isn't relevant. Yes, in a perfect world, this wouldn't be a good idea, but I realised that letting them think I'm a cis woman usually causes fewer problems.\n\nWhen it becomes relevant I tell them I don't have a uterus or ovaries from birth (the truth) and refuse to go into details. It is close enough to my medical status that in 99.9% of cases it doesn't matter.\n\nEven if their forms ask for sex and gender or birth sex, I usually tick female everywhere, unless it's to do with transition, I don't tell most doctors I'm trans. I usually insist on being closely involved in my medical things, and usually know quite a lot about the things relevant to me, often more than all but the experts, and if something becomes a possibility where my only having one X chromosome was relevant, I'd reveal my trans status.\n\nThat said, I don't really hide it either, unless a doctor is too insistent.

Take a serious look at everything you‚Äôve said here. \n\nThink about it and really consider if you want a relationship with someone who does these things. Are there any affirming things he does? What are the good qualities of the relationship? If you‚Äôre out, how does he treat you in person? How does he treat you in front of his friends? Do you even see his friends? \n\nYou have two general options here. Enforce your boundaries or try to reach an agreement on how he‚Äôs going to treat you during your relationship.\n\nEnforcing your boundaries is something you do alone. You decide what you will and won‚Äôt put up with and how you will respond to someone crossing your boundaries. Typically that‚Äôs distancing yourself from any relationship with the person crossing boundaries. You should be thinking about your boundaries even if you want to reach an agreement, so that if things don‚Äôt improve you know what you will and won‚Äôt put up with.\n\nIf you want to you can try to move past this by telling him the things he says and does involving you that you don‚Äôt like and see if he‚Äôs willing to correct his behavior. Tell him all the things that make you uncomfortable.\n\nRemember you are a whole person and he should treat you as one and not a sex object or a box to check off (also that‚Äôs a huge red flag imo).\n\np.s. Dom/Sub and Top/Bottom are two separate things. If you‚Äôre comfortable with it you can always ask about using toys or a strap-on or something. Also you saying you don‚Äôt want to top him with your bits shouldn‚Äôt be something you have to say more than once. If you do that‚Äôs him not respecting your boundaries and a big boundary at that."

Doesn't matter that it's something you might do during sex regardless, it's selfish to do it if he's only doing it for shits and giggles.

I'd rather be a woman sitting in a camp with other trans people, trying to encourage them and commiserate and keep our strength up in the face of our circumstances, than be a \"man\" putting on an act every day while my body feels alien and I continue to be so miserable that I don't even know what not-miserable would feel like.  \n\nWhatever comes, focus on becoming the best possible version of yourself to meet it.  Live your life as freely as possible - if resistance needs to be a part of that, then it'll be a lot more feasible to resist if you're *you* and not someone hiding or burying parts of yourself.  Resistance will also be a lot more feasible if you have already tasted freedom.\n\nHere's a simplified overview of your possible paths:  \n\n- You don't transition, and the next 4 years are a struggle for our community but not quite as bad as we think:  There is a struggle for our rights and we ultimately win out even though it's nasty, and there might be a period where restrictions *do* pass and violence *does* happen.  At the end of that struggle, you would still be at Step 1 of becoming who you really are - you'll still be living with the struggle you currently have.  Not desirable, obviously, but let's see what the other outcomes might be.\n\n- You don't transition, and the rhetoric and violence against us escalate to outright genocide.  Trans people who don't get killed in the streets (by militias/gangs/lone bigots) are imprisoned under \"anti-drag\" laws and detransitioned/denied medical care.  History is papered over and books/internet/media are heavily scrubbed to try to erase us.  4 years from now, you might be physically safe because of your decision to not transition (assuming you don't still get harmed/killed for other reasons, or get outed, etc), but you are still living in a violent, repressive society under a fascist regime, and are suffering from gender dysphoria that you have masked/covered up.  There is still a struggle, and you're too busy surviving *and* masking/covering up depression to really participate in that struggle or resist.  Not desirable, obviously, but let's explore the other possible outcomes.  \n\n- You transition, and the next 4 years are a struggle for our community but not quite as bad as we think:  There is a struggle for our rights and we ultimately win out even though it's nasty, and there might be a period where restrictions *do* pass and violence *does* happen.  You make it, and pursue your transition goals relentlessly, even while it's difficult or seemingly impossible.  At the end of that struggle (whether it lasts 4 years or longer), you are out from under fascism and in a society that recognizes our rights again, and you are *yourself*.   Obviously living through a struggle isn't quite desirable, but this seems like an alright outcome; let's see what the other outcomes might be.  \n\n- You transition, and things are as bad as they could possibly be:  you face violence, exclusion from society, imprisonment, and death.  Let's say you get rounded up, suffer, and eventually die for being trans.  You die a woman - no matter how far you got in your medical transition, whether you were legally and socially recognized as female, etc, you die with the knowledge and certainty and knowing that you did everything possible to make that fact about yourself known in a world that absolutely tried to prevent you from doing so.  Definitely not desirable, but honestly, is this a worse fate than our second scenario, where you were *still trans* and *still living under a fascist regime*, but were basically struggling with dysphoria *in addition to* the normal struggles of living under such a regime?  \n\n\nI can't tell you what to do - only you get to make that choice - but I can tell you with certainty that if I was starting from scratch with my transtiion right now, I'd still start.  I'd still at least get HRT - and maybe a binder and be planning to stay closeted for a little while.  I'd take my time planning on coming out to a few people at a time.  I'd think about my job/income and whether I could keep it once I was out, I'd be thinking about maybe moving to a safe blue state on the border with Canada, and having my passport so I could cross the border if needed.\n\nYou have a lot to think about.  I know it's terrifying right now.  Know that you're not alone and there's a whole community here for you.  Good luck, whatever choice you make and wherever life takes you."

Even if I have to be forcibly detransitioned I need to know, my soul needs to know, I went for that shit and I didn‚Äôt give up. \n\nWe have to keep going regardless of what happens"

HRT most likely won‚Äôt be banned since plenty of cis people use it too, and even if it somehow does get specifically banned for trans people, state laws will most likely supersede federal laws as long as you live in a blue state. The best way to start is as soon as possible, and I wouldn‚Äôt let any perceived fears stop you from doing so if it‚Äôs something you truly want to pursue."

If you start now, you‚Äôll have four more years of your life lived authentically. I know a lot of older people who would do damn near anything for four extra years in the sun. We have a lot of people alive today who never got the chance to transition because it wasn‚Äôt safe or accepted just yet. The people who stood up and lived authentically and stood up for our rights to do so went down in history. But progress isn‚Äôt linear, and there‚Äôs really no end and beginning. We have to keep pushing forward with our heads held high even when they set us back, over and over again. However; your personal duty is to yourself, and your own safety. There‚Äôs a lot of things to consider when deciding when it is safe to transition. You would probably be fine in a blue state or if you were close to Canada. If you‚Äôre living with your parents, would they support and protect you? If you‚Äôre the kind of person whose main goal in life is to survive, it‚Äôs okay to stay in hiding a little longer, but it has to be your choice. If you have to build a life for yourself where it‚Äôs safe to be you, do that. I wish you nothing but happiness and love. Stay brave, know they will not erase us. If you decide not to transition now, maybe some more experimenting with your look will help to pass the time. no one should have to live in hiding, but you have to consider if it‚Äôs safe where you are to be yourself."

You aren‚Äôt even finished with puberty yet. I‚Äôm so happy for people your age that get this figured out because it opens possibilities for your transition that will likely never be possible for those of us that figure it out later in life. \n\nThree, even if the orange one figures out a way to ban it, which is doubtful because of how prevalent it is, it will still be around in some form or another as HRT is used for more than just gender affirmative care.\n\nFour, even if it does get interrupted, you will be better off than if you never started and you can either get back on it later or work on relocating some place where you can get it sooner."

It comes from doing all of those things and then still making a conscious decision that the outcomes of your chosen course of action outweigh the risks, and being able to actually overcome the overwhelming default mental response mechanisms toward comfort and stasis that your lizard brain has in place to prevent you from doing those things.\n\nAnd a misrepresentation of that notion is compounded by the fact that the concept of courage works at a very abstract level of cognizance, essentially a label for a complex matrix of different cause/effect value judgements effectively applied in hindsight. It shouldn't be dismissed as something so simple as \"a decision made due to having no good options because the options aren't safe and/or comfortable and/or ideal.\" Because there's a lot more going on there.\n\nAnd even if it was, to quote some people: Nelson Mandela once said, \"I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.\" Teddy Roosevelt said, \"Courage is not having the strength to go on, it is going on when you don't have the strength.\" Another Roosevelt said, \"Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear.\" Not his most famous, but arguably more cogent, and definitely more useful in this context. There's a lot going on inside the shorthand of \"being brave.\"\n\nIt bothers me too when people say that, though, I admit. That I'm brave, I mean. Because I feel like a pussy most days, and utterly terrified on the worst of them. I never *feel* brave. But I'm probably not the best person to make that assessment. Most people in that position, that situation where they're having to *live* bravery, whatever that situation is, never could be, because their brains aren't thinking about how that act would be viewed externally. They're just doing their own internal mental calculus. But the truth is, that mental calculus I (we) are doing is what the world mind considers brave.\n\nWhat I'm saying is don't sell yourself short. And don't let it bother you. 'Cuz ya are brave. Guaranteed."

They are not a unified front; they are a faction of mercenary interests. And that's a good thing.\n\nJust as Trump's first (arguably more together) administration was not able to fundamentally destroy this country, and just as Biden's administration couldn't set right all of the wrongs done by Trump, et. al. during theirs, this new round of croutons simply aren't powerful enough, intelligent enough, or (and this is the really important one) unified enough to be some godless empire of evil that is going to bring ruin on the scale a lot of people fear.\n\nAre some going to suffer? Yeah. They will. Will our community? In some ways, almost definitely so. Are we still in a better place than we've ever been in the history of the human race going into this shit show? Unequivocally.

Just look at the variety of labels under the Two Spirit umbrella.\n\nI myself am Cherokee, and consider myself usegi - a term that simply means \"strange\". It essentially is another term for nonbinary. I also have Taino heritage, and my tribe - before the Spanish came in and kidnapped them to be married off or worse, anyway - was run matrilineally by women who were described as \"very masculine\". Their mannerisms, their attitudes, sometimes even the way they dressed was masculine, and no one questioned their authority. Later on after the Spanish invasion forced many of them to flee, they're the ones who started the rumor of Amazons. Sure, they weren't transmasc or FTM - but thats a very modern term. Trans men and mascs are usually, as a form of erasure, viewed as \"masculine women\" and not men. That doesn't mean that we didn't exist, its just erasure, but we're there if you know what to look for.  I personally view my also being transmasc as a sort of call back to that heritage, as well, and I'm quite proud of it. \n\nI can think of numerous other examples - iirc the Apache even have a Two Spirit term of their own that mentions \"having masculine energy\", but my point is by no means is there only examples of AMAB and MTF folks in ancient times and the like. Even Hjira are not just MTF, its considered a whole third gender of its own, for AFAB and AMAB folks alike. You might see a lot of trans women that are representing the Hjira on TV or whatever, but thats never been the meaning of the word afaik. \n\nJust because the vast majority of trans rep tends to default to trans women doesn't mean thats all that ever existed. Its more likely that, similar to modern times, documented because it was more visible and therefore more controversial to bigots - and due to erasure of trans men and mascs as a whole."

It's possible that some of the disparity could be a byproduct of many anthropologists being men (and therefore more interested in breaking of male gender norms. Margaret Mead criticized this a lot.)\n\nC.) In most societies, misogyny is present. This leads to a perception of masculinity as good and femininity as bad. There may be equal numbers of GNC/trans men/women in a society, but the GNC men and/or trans women are going to be more taboo for the same reason that conservatives flip their shit over trans women but not so much trans men today: willingly choosing to be more masculine/male is \"only logical\", but choosing to be feminine/female when one has the option of being male is completely absurd. So the trans women and GNC men are othered. \n\nAnother personal guess of mine is that cis men may find themselves attracted to trans women or GNC men, and this scares them because they are insecure about their sexuality. So they decide that these trans women and GNC men are allowed to break the gender binary, since it helps them rationalize their attraction. E.g. \"I'm not gay for wanting to have sex with someone who has a penis, since they're actually not male.\""

Do for a woman to try to be like them is much more acceptable that for a man to carry to traits and desires to be a women. Men were the stronger hunter gatherers, the wiser ones. Females were looked as the week ones. \n\nSecondly,  I too have read about views from other cultures regarding the inclusion of non traditional people.  In some cultures instead of looking down upon us, we were respected. It was thought that we contain the spirits of both halves of people. \n\nBut in the end it's all about trying to find any way possible to elevate themselves above others. To feel superior."

Perhaps it's likely that all derivations are more likely to default in their wiring to feminine, so AMABs are more likely to become MTF due to the added complexity of male development compared to the developmental default that is there in everyone. Guevedoces might show an interesting alternative example of this tendency can express."

But at the time she dressed in an odd, masculinized version of women's clothes and never identified as anything but a woman. She had money and therefore power. She couldn't risk being seen as hysterical.\n\nBy comparison in the working class we do get people living as men because they're nobodies. And aside from a few famous exceptions, that's why we'll never know about them. They could have posed into their 30s as teen boys and moved periodically. Who would know?"

I saw a TikTok of a guy whose good friend of many years died, and when he attended his funeral, he saw him open-casket in a dress. This completely confused him as he had no idea his friend was trans. The family told him, and he was so mad at his friend's family for doing this to him in his death. I was quite mad myself just listening to it.\n\nSo even today, I can totally see how this would unfortunately have happened in the past, especially with several of your other points rolled into the equation."

This made me think that in a lot of ancient societies that despite tolerating their relatives gender non-conformance, they were never truly respected as their gender, which has contributed to the erasure of a lot of trans people in history.

This is a broad question and it is really hard to exactly quantify it. \n\nWomen have always faced huge amounts of sexualization regardless of being cis or trans and people of color as a whole faced more sexualization than their white counterparts.\n\nThis isn't even going into fetishization which is a whole other ball game. \n\nI think it is fair to say that the more intersectional you are and further away from CIS White heteronormativity the more sexualized and fetishized you become. \n\nAll that being said I can really only truly speak in my experience. As a trans Woman I have personally experienced less sexualization than my AFAB non binary partner. However, people seem to fetishize me a lot."

    "comment_body": "Absolutely. Particularly trans feminine people. Trans men have an entire set of their own challenges, but they are not as sexualized, because in a misogynistic culture, men don't fetishize trans men. \n\nDating as a trans feminine person (unless you are dating another trans or nb), is a shit show. Fetishization is rampant, particularly among str8 men & even some out bi men. Trans feminine people are a stigmatized 'other' in western society. And our culture is now trying to resist letting us normalize, esp in the UK and the United States.\n\nI'm a trans woman (medically transitioning, on HRT) and passable in most situations. I date mostly str8 guys & occasionally str8 identifying, bi guys. I'd say that about 70-80% of my interactions on dating apps (the primary way most of us meet who we date) are hyper sexualized and the guys have zero interest in anything other than fetishizing sex. I literally get messages from men that are just a dick pic & no message or explicit messages about very specific, clearly fantasy, sex acts as an introductory message on mainstream dating apps like Tinder, Badoo, POF, and Tiami.\n\nThat approx 70 - 80% of men (who fetishize us) almost always have no interest in conversation or actually dating or meeting socially. They strictly want sex - and usually very specific, often unrealistic, porn inspired sex and sex partners. That is, they want us dressed as dolls in very particular positions, doing, wearing & saying very specific things. It's creepy af. \n\nIf you do engage a guy who just sends a dick pic or explicit message (I mean, sometimes i have hope guys, what can I say?üòã), after letting him know he'd need to, at the very least, identify himself beyond a picture of his genitals & have a genuine conversation, often times, you earn an immediate block. Seriously. \n\nI'd say approx 20% of guys are willing to actually engage in conversation and maybe a third or a quarter of those might be willing to actually publicly date a trans woman. \n\nObviously this is anecdotal to my experience and the experience of my friends.  Hyper-feminine trans women who are both hot and literally indistinguishable from cis women in any situation will have a different experience, as will non passing trans women and enbies who don't identify as women but may present feminine & date men. (Please forgive me enbies, I don't have the experience or knowledge to identify the different challenges you might face in these situations. I have much to learn, but please advise here) \n\nI'd love to hear what other trans fem & trans enbies who date men experience is. üíú"

Because a person's soul/mind/self is equated with their identity combined with the belief that a soul can only be created by God, there can be no kinds of ontological shakiness regarding a person's identity.\n\n3. This results in turning \"normal\" (i.e. typical) into [moral] norms, and sacralizing what's deemed \"natural.\"\n\n4. Trans people disrupt and subvert that solid ontology by proving how slippery and shaky identity is. They are deemed unnatural and not to be trusted.\n\nOption B:\n\n1. \"God didn't make any mistakes.\"\n\nI think Option A is the more complete and interesting one.

    "comment_body": "Ex-fundie here.  Christians, even within specific denominations and stuff, aren't actually super-consistent with their beliefs on a lot of stuff, and this is one of those things.  My extended family - mostly Pentecostals - spans the range from not speaking to or acknowledging me at all, to saying they disagree with my 'lifestyle' but will gender me correctly after my 'sex change', to begging me not to get the 'sex change' and saying that it'll make me an abomination unable to enter heaven (apparently I won't be \"in God's image\" anymore)\n\nThis is because of a combination of two things: that fundamentalists are moral prescriptivists, and that their holy book doesn't prescribe them a clear moral standpoint on trans people. \n\nWhile a lot of people, even religious people outside of fundamentalism, arrive at their moral and ethics through a variety of processes (usually a sliding scale from \"what I was taught by my parents/culture\" to \"what's good for me and those I love\" to \"what is right and best for my society/culture\" or \"what does the greatest good/harms none\" as one matures) and people usually figure out their moral and ethical boundaries through observing role models, learning how their actions impact others, and through critical thinking - people within fundamentalism arrive at their morals in an entirely different way.  Their hierarchy is entirely built on what they've been instructed is right:  their primary source being their religious text, and then their other sources being their religious leaders and their father (or husband, or man of the household).  If their religious texts don't say anything about trans people, then they rely on messaging from their pastor.  If their pastor has never preached on it (and manipulated unrelated scriptures to create a stance/take on the subject), and they've not heard other preachers in their denomination give a clear message on it, then they're basically gonna be left with whatever bottom-of-the-barrel dregs of bigotry they may've picked up from other men in their church or family.  And then, beyond that, they have to do something they're very much not used to:  critically thinking and forming their own moral stance.  And they're not good at that.  Because that's *not usually allowed* in fundamentalism - that's how you end up with people having independent thoughts, you know?\n\n\nSo yeah.  That's how you end up with fundiea having wildly inconsistent morals.  They're getting it all from a primary source that's actually dozens of different books all badly translated and mispackaged as religious doctrine, preached by guys who have mantras like \"if the Bible says it, God says it, and I believe it!\", and they have to navigate the world based on that and with as little independent thought as possible.\n\nOf *course* they're confused when they see someone being free and living their life in a way that's not even talked about in the Bible."

It's deeply racist and asserts that people (and especially folks born with working uteri) have little to not value as human beings beyond their ability to produce a shitload of (white--it's always about whiteness) babies to join the church and push back against the growing multiculturalism of America. It's how they see themselves as fighting back against [The Great Replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement_conspiracy_theory), and why they see (white) people leaving their religion as such a vile betrayal--they're no longer participating in the great big racist project anymore.\n\nAnd because they see themselves as the only sources of Truth, and trans people exist outside of that Truth, they believe with all their evangelical hearts that we'll all See The Light and detransition, then convert to their specific religion, because of the perfection of that Truth. When we do--remember, they see it as being inevitable--if we do not have the ability to Be Fruitful and Multiply, then we're basically worthless to them. Converting us is nice, as far as they're concerned, but what they really see us to be is the peak of a multigenerational pyramid scheme of (white) little xtian soldiers to purge the world of all the unbelievers (read: queers, Black, and brown people).\n\nAnd if that sounds grim and fucked up?

They pray and hope for the best.\n\nJim Henson was raised by Christian Scientists, and though he was not practicing, it's hard to get into the habit of going to the doctor as an adult if you weren't raised with it.  He didn't seek medical intervention for his pneumonia until his situation was severe.  That's why he died."

The dong actually kinda has nuance.\n\nNothing exists outside of context. If you don't like the song for some reason, that's totally legitimate. Liking the song, as a trans person, is totally legitimate too. \n\nI recall talking to another trans girl who was telling me I couldn't wear my Public Image Ltd pin because Johnny Lydon is a TERF & a MAGAt. But PiL is a band made up of multiple people & their bass player is very much the opposite of of Lydon. He's also incredibly inspirational to me as a bass player.

Then when transgender people tried to  move away from the sexual and objectifying idea some people didn‚Äôt understand why. \n\nIt also, in a way, shows that they see women as a whole as just sexual objects because ‚Äôwhy would a man want to be a woman‚Äô type of idea. You add that to people not really listening to transgender people when they explain why they want to be the opposite way they were assigned as birth. \n\nBut also because, weirdly enough, they can‚Äôt see women other than sexual objects either. Like the video of the guy who went up and started breaching to two young woman, who I think were minors at the time, to ‚Äúcover up more‚Äù because ‚ÄúA man might fall seeing you like that‚Äù.\n\nBecause they have the idea that women are only for sexual gratification they think it‚Äôs inappropriate. (And yes I know I‚Äôve repeated the same point like 20 times.) \n\nIt also should be pointed out that when It comes to trans-men they face a similar idea but this is more ‚Äògay thought bad‚Äô type thing. Since a lot of trans-men tend to pass as Cis men. Most trans women also pass very well too but when it comes to T.M since they tend to be hair, muscular, and handsome they get worried they‚Äôre gay to a point which adds some homophobia to the mix. \n\n\n\nSo TLDR; They see women only as sexual objects and get confused when someone who was born male would want to be seen as a woman."

All the while they ignore transmen, which maybe it's a bit of a stereotype but the ones I know all have pretty powerful beards and whatnot and I REALLY don't think they thought about them using the women's room.\n\nNo, it's all about controlling those dastardly transwomen somehow which is an extension of the stupid misogynistic BS they spew all over the politics board. IMO your feminism laden opinion is spot on!"

We should have no right to interfere with that. Just like they should not have the right to say it's illegal to transition.\n\nI would say this point is very flawed, and it's a false equivalency.\n\nBeing trans is, at least for a decent number of people, an inherent trait that cannot be changed. Many people die because of their identities being denied, after all, the saying \"gender-affirming care is suicide prevention\" is commonly stated for a reason. Parents who teach the values you are mentioning in your post cause significant, potentially irreversible psychological harm to transgender children. These perspectives are very similar to conversion therapy, which is proven to be ineffective and harmful.\n\nI would understand your point a lot more if there werent lives on the line. \n\nSaying it is illegal to transition does absolutely no harm to cis people, and all the harm to trans people. Both of these points cause harm to the oppressed, and have no repercussions to the oppressors."

    "comment_body": "It sounds like maybe you've realized that you're trans but you haven't unpacked all of the implications yet. Congratulations on coming out and I hope you find the journey to a more personal understanding is relatively frictionless. People are probably going to be pretty hostile and downvote you, because arguing with this take which, frankly, comes off as really transphobic and ignorant is an endless, thankless task- as soon as one person is addressed another pops up offering the same thing, and eventually it gets easier to just shout them down.\n\nBut I'm in a mood to write today so I'm going to try.\n\n> Why do we get to force our beliefs in them, but they can't force their beliefs in us? How about both sides stop forcing anything, instead just accept everyone.\n\nIt *really* sounds like you haven't actually accepted that being trans is normal yet. Let's start by saying that I agree with you, if being trans is *actually* an abnormal \"Opinion,\" then the things you're saying make sense- nobody else is obligated to \"Believe\" it, we should live and let live. And guess what, we do! I don't give a *damn* what some fool thinks about me. I am a woman and I live as a woman and if someone says \"You're a *man*\" I go \"OK :)\" and carry on with my day. \n\nHowever- those aren't actually the things that are happening. It's not \"You won't let us say you're a man in peace :(\" that is the problem. This isn't a calm, reasonable discussion about a \"Belief.\" In my home state last year there were something like 30+ bills trying to make it illegal for me to exist. Illegal to \"Cross-dress\" in public, illegal to use a women's bathroom, illegal for therapists or psychologists to even *talk about being trans* to anyone under 25. They are doing their best to ban medical care for us, too- not just kids, but adults as well. You just came out- imagine that you are doing so in a world where it's literally a crime to be you. That is the actual fight we're having, not whether it's legal for some person to disagree with you. All those laws are founded on the the idea that the guy saying \"You're a man\" is *objectively right* and *his beliefs should be protected by law*. **That** is why this is so militant and the fight is so difficult. Again, I don't give a damn what some guy thinks. What I care about is that he (and 77 million more like him) are trying to *make me live in a way that makes him comfortable, or die.* And if you come out and start living as your trans self, they're going to do the same to you.\n\n\nLet's address some specific points:\n\nSchools- I am not sure what you have heard or believe here. There is an enormous amount of fear mongering. Maybe you should speak to some teachers- they are going to tell you that no school is teaching gender stuff to kids. They would be absolutely *pilloried* if they did. What is being criminalized right now is not \"Teaching kids about gender\" it's *protecting trans kids*. Respecting a trans child's identity and not outing them to their parents- if you look at the laws that are being passed, that is what is being made illegal. Nobody's going into classrooms and telling Billy he's a girl. But the good ones are trying to protect Susie when she *says* she's a girl, and the right-wing says they should go to jail for that. If you understand in your heart that you didn't *choose* to be trans, do you think those kids did? That they're being taught to be this way? Imagine you had hateful, unaccepting parents- but you decided your teacher was safe. If you'd told your teacher you were trans, would you want them to respect you? Or would you want them to say \"Legally I have to call you by your deadname and also inform your parents immediately that we had this conversation.\" The fight here is not to protect parents' rights to raise their kids how they want- it is to give children a last-resort space to be themselves so they don't spend have to spend their whole childhoods in the closet, *which is why trans kids commit suicide at ridiculous rates.* Look up the statistics- this is a fight to save kid's lives.\n\nSports- Again I am not sure what you have heard or believe. And again, maybe look around at the actual competitions- there are like, 1 or 2 trans athletes in any given *state* and *none* of them are winning often. It turns out that medical transition from testosterone to estrogen (which is already required) actually completely changes the physical performance of the body- that trans women really are just, physically, women. It *also* turns out that there is a long long history in women's sports going back to 100 years ago of accusing women of color and \"Masculine\" cis women of not being \"Feminine\" enough, and actively testing their testosterone levels and policing them, and if you look at the women who are being persecuted for this trans sports stuff- in the last year two different cis women of color are the most prominent ones who have been attacked. This is purely a culture-war distraction that is being used to alienate trans people from cis folks and drive a wedge in. I don't *care* about sports. But nobody pushing this issue cares about women's sports either, and if you look at *any* of them you'll notice that they don't spend a single second thinking or talking about women's sports except for this one issue. What they actually care about is finding an easy way to enforce their belief that \"Trans people are not what they say they are.\" Once everyone agrees on sports, they move on to bathrooms. Then schools, then legal paperwork, then medical care.\n\n>Why do we get to force our beliefs in them, but they can't force their beliefs in us? How about both sides stop forcing anything, instead just accept everyone.\n\nReturning to this. I have never forced my beliefs on anyone. I haven't seen a single law passed saying \"Trans women are women, trans men are men.\" Have you? Have you seen a single consequence for anyone getting up on a national stage and saying trans women are men? I just watched a man get elected president after running 200 million dollars in ads about how we shouldn't be allowed to have medical care in prison. I am *happy* to leave the bigots alone. But I'm going to keep speaking up to defend myself, and you're going to have to learn pretty quickly to do the same. Because it's not really about living in peace- it's about living at all, and there are a lot of folks who do not think we should be allowed to."

You have to figure out how to love yourself or at least live with yourself when it feels like no one else will, you have to learn to self-reflect and recognize what makes you uncomfortable, what makes you happier, who, makes you happier. Learn to coexist with people who will never accept you even when you hate them and wish you didn‚Äôt have to deal with them, learn to make concessions in who you are for your safety even though you shouldn‚Äôt have to and still find a way to preserve your sense of self. You have to learn how to hold on to each other. Hold your community and let them hold you when the world goes further and further to hell. Most of us have or have had a trans friend who‚Äôs pain we can relate to so deeply when they‚Äôre stuck in a situation we barely crawled out of, and learned to stay open to their pain even when it hurts us too. When I see trans kids I just remember what it was like and it kills me how fast they‚Äôve had to grow up. Then you learn how to find people who will be kind and you love them and you constantly learn new ways to be kinder. You learn to recognize how far you‚Äôve come, to keep going when it feels like you‚Äôre barely going anywhere. You learn what it takes to advocate for yourself. You learn to advocate for others who can‚Äôt advocate for themselves. You learn to be authentic to yourself to accept other people‚Äôs authenticity. If you survive long enough in the community amid some pretty toxic ‚Äòdiscourse‚Äô you probably eventually adapt a ‚Äòlive and let live‚Äô attitude once you see how pointless it is. All of it, the good and the bad, teaches, often unkindly, how important it is to be kind. How to be empathetic. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying that cis people can‚Äôt learn the same lessons from their lives, but less have to. I think for a lot of them it‚Äôs more or less optional side quests. Being trans kinda grabs you and pulls you through a series of really difficult and sometimes uniquely beautiful situations and every time you come out the other side you grow or wilt. The magic of our community I think is the sheer number of us who grow. \n\n(Cheesy, I know, but I just love us so much. I‚Äôm so proud of all of us. I think it‚Äôs good that we appreciate each other and from time to time that‚Äôs allowed to mean gushing over each other. Sue me. But not actually I can‚Äôt afford a lawsuit.)"

I feel society puts a lot of pressure on people to pick either a male or female identity. I have been on HRT for a year, I‚Äôve developed breasts, I‚Äôve removed all hair from my torso. And, I do not rule out the possibility that I may want to present and/or identify totally as female in the future. But, I also know that the primary source of my dysphoria is my genitals. So, correcting that is the most important thing for me. Otherwise, I plan to continue presenting mostly male or androgynous or slightly femme depending on how I feel. And I‚Äôm ok with that. I guess bottom line, some of us don‚Äôt follow a typical path, and that‚Äôs ok."

If your state has insurance coverage mandates for gender affirming care, then that will follow through as well, if federal mandates disappear. (I'm in NJ where we do have such mandates, albeit via executive order).\n\nWhat Trump/Republicans are likely to do is fuck with funding for gender affirming care on the federal level. Very likely that we see at a minimum sort of of defunding effort for facilities that provide gender affirming treatment and procedures for people under 18. While this would not technically be a ban, this would basically kill any such programs run by hospitals, and a lot of charities that do recieve federal funds. Trans people under 18 would then have to turn to a handful of private providers willing to provide care.\n\nEverything else is a gregorian knot of complications. The FDA ultimately does not ban off label uses of medicines, and to institute one now would be a ton of chaos, much to the extent that we'd be setting medical standards back decades for everyone. Can't make Estradiol a controlled substance without it immediately becoming a reproductive rights issue (no more over the counter birth control, requirements for in person visits for renewals, etc). Difficult to make sex based laws that don't infringe upon the 14th amendment and the civil rights act, though I guess we'll see how the Supreme Court plays out with their trans youth care ban case."

They're very much part time and work and live primarily as male, but they are always female presenting when we meet, and that's also how they present themselves on hookup sites. They often talk of some man they've been chatting with and it always comes to the same thing: \"He says he's straight, but how can he be straight if he's interested in me?\"\n\nTo my mind, sexuality is identity just like gender is. All of us have to jump through quite a few hoops to arrive at the conclusion that we are women in a world that insists we are men. No reason why a man can't jump through similar hoops to conclude that he's straight, even though he's sexually interested in people with penises. \n\nRespect sincere identity.

Queer is an umbrella term describing people with a whole range of sexual, romantic, or gender identities, anyone who is not heterosexual and/or cisgender. You definitely don't have to be both. It's obviously okay if you personally do not wish to use the term queer for yourself, but if someone is trans and that is the only way they are part of the lgbtq+ community (for example, a trans man or trans woman who is also heterosexual and heteroromantic) then it would definitely still be okay for them to use the term queer for themselves because queer also covers any gender identity that isnt cis."

With my shirt off they used to look a lot more like puffy pecs than boobs.  In the last few weeks I have noticed that they have gotten slightly bigger to the point that both of them somewhat hang now a bit.    \n  \nLet me put it this way.  With a bra on that had minimal padding and a tshirt my friend did a hand assessment and thought I had somewhere between b and c cups. IDK if she was trying to be overly generous with that assessment but when I showed her what I looked like with no shirt on she was surprised at how flat my chest actually looked bare. \n\nAs practically no one sees me naked and I feel like I look good in a bikini I think it is all great though."

It's easy to talk about banning things for children because children effectively have no rights. If you ask them if they're okay with surgeries for trans adults, notice that it's always with the subtext of, \"Well if they want to mutilate their own body that's their choice.\"\n\n\nIf you press most of these people into a corner, they'll say that therapy should be the preferred approach. In other words, they don't want *anybody* to transition. If you think that the people that appear to be okay with trans adults are actually okay with trans adults, just wait about 2 years. It was *never* about protecting children. It was *always* about erasing trans people.\n\nI'm glad that we have people like you that are actually willing to stand up for us, but they've already decided that transition is a bad thing. Mark my words, we will absolutely have people saying that adults shouldn't be allowed to transition with their full chests within the next two years as part of mainstream discourse. Children are just the beginning.\n\nEDIT: You'll note that I didn't even address children having gender affirming surgery. That's because whether it does or doesn't happen is irrelevant. The point is to outlaw it for some people in order to open the door to outlawing it for everybody.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT: Yep, I figured it was *that* subreddit. I saw that post too, and yes the comments are a complete trash fire. I'm not sure why the user base there seems to swing so conservative, but alas. it's hilarious that that user posted that point as though they were speaking some clandestine truth to power instead of just parroting the mainstream view. lol"

If the person is a minor, it's child abuse. But the moment that person turns 18, becomes an adult, they are labeled as pedophile. There's no convincing them.\n\nMy opinion is: if you are old enough to join the army to shoot someone, around 17-18, you are old enough to decide what surgery to get. Younger than that, like 16, maybe with parental permission. Below 16, probably play it safe, puberty blocker, and wait. The kid has enough time to understand and be sure of their decision. It is a tough situation when the kid attempts suicide to escape dysphoria, though. I guess special exemptions can be made for some cases."

    "comment_body": "Well, look. The whole question is really a political quagmire, with 99% of the \"controversy\" ginned up by bad-faith politicians who just want to score cheap political points. They don't really care of the cost of their point-winning strategy is borne by trans people.\n\nBut anyway, that soapbox aside: if we just look at it from a best-outcomes perspective, then no, I don't think children should be able to get gender affirming surgery either. Not as a rule. And I say that as a middle-aged trans woman who understands full well what living with dysphoria is like.\n\nWhat I do think is that, like *any* surgery, it should be considered on a case by case basis in consultation with the child, the parents, the surgeon, and the child's mental health provider.\n\nAnd 99% of the time or whatever, the decision should be \"I know it sucks, but it's better to wait until you're full grown.\"\n\nBecause the reality is that GCS (assuming we're talking about bottom surgery, here) is a *big* deal. That's a major surgery, with significant, lengthy, and complex recovery. It requires significant attention to after-care to ensure best healing. For transfemme GCS where the patient wants a full-depth procedure, there's a commitment to daily dilation, which is time consuming and uncomfortable. *Every* day. The recovery and after-care concerns alone are not especially compatible with the level of follow-through and responsibility that most kids have. The odds of the kid *not* following all the post-op guidelines for long enough, and ending up with a complication or other bad outcome, are just too high. No matter how much the kid begs for it. It's kind of like \"Can we get a dog? Pleeeezzzzzeeee? I promise I'll feed it and walk it and pick up after it\" except with higher stakes. With a dog, when the kid inevitably flakes out, the parent can do it or can just give the dog away. With GCS, when the kid flakes out you end up back in the hospital needing more surgery. So no, I don't think most trans kids are actually ready to handle what GCS entails. \n\nFurthermore (as if that wasn't enough), these surgeries are a rapidly evolving field. I wouldn't call them experimental anymore, at this stage, but it's an area where new developments are still showing up with some regularity. Waiting means taking advantage of any improvements that happen within the upcoming 10 to 15 years (when the kid is full-grown and finally ready for it).\n\nAlso, doing GCS on a kid means reconfiguring tissues on a body that is *still growing*. And I don't think we have any good data on whether the reconfigured tissue is going to grow like it should afterwards. (Maybe there's data on this and I just don't know it. IDK.) If I was the parent of a kid asking for GCS, no matter how supportive I was, I'd still be pretty concerned about how that tissue and any surgical scarring is going to react over time, as the kid goes through their HRT-induced puberty and whatever final years of growth into adulthood that they have left. I would think it's probably better to wait until their body has reached full adult stature before GCS.\n\nSo yeah, it should be evaluated on a case by case basis, but in almost every case, the answer should probably be \"not yet.\" Because also? Plenty of other good research data shows that kids who are supported in a *social* transition from an early age have much lower dysphoria and mental health outcomes that are more or less equivalent to age-peer cis kids. I.e. \"let your kid socially transition, and their dysphoria will probably drop to a level they can manage until they're old enough to handle getting GCS.\"\n\nBut, once in a while you are going to find a kid who has such overwhelming, debilitating body-centered dysphoria that they need GCS anyway--despite the risks and challenges--as a matter of enabling them to function in their day to day lives. For those *very few* kids, yes, they ought to be able to get it. They shouldn't be forced to suffer until they turn 18 or whatever. But that's a decision that's going to be arrived at only after a *lot* (like, really, a LOT) of careful evaluation by the kid's parents, doctor, and psychologist. I worry less about that kid getting GCS than a run-of-the-mill trans kid getting it, too. Because that kid is *desperate*. If anybody's kid is going to comply with all the recovery and after-care requirements, it's going to be that kid."

People can get breast implants (rarely covered by insurance, fwiw; at this time I am only aware of Maryland Medicaid covering detransition related surgeries), and followup surgeries where prior plastic surgery has been done are more complex; it doesn't work quite the same as implants for mtf spectrum folks. And if the nipple was grafted without retaining erogenous sensation, which is frustratingly commonly presented as the only option, that sensation is lost for good.\n\nIt's also worth note that providers' high level of scrutiny on these patients isn't always the same as proper support for the patient's resources for decision-making. Resources include time, lack of pressure, and gender diverse community, not just information. There is a small but real number of detransitioners who have dealt with this stuff, and some report this gap as an issue. I obviously can't speak to each individual experience. But having talked with both trans and cis people working on ensuring trans health care access, and simply having dealt with health care workers in and out of my own care, I believe that this is a real issue for at least some of them.\n\nSo yes this question is a trap, but not because this never happens, or because when it happens it is always done perfectly. Rather, it's a trap because people asking this are using it to argue whether or not this care should exist, rather than asking how often it is going as intended and how it can be improved."

Surely the easier intervention would be to try to stop the teenager from binding unhealthy but are providers really seeing a teenager doing that behaviour and suddenly be more likely to do top surgery on a minor.\n\nTop surgery (at least in Canada and US) is commonly available to minors (except states that have now passed laws), the surgeons requires supporting letters and depending on provider and state will ask for parental consent. Many place will say 16+ with parental consent with letters and 18+ without parental consent. Some place might not even ask for letters of support as the patient pays cash. In Qu√©bec the popular Qu√©bec offers top to 16+ with letters and they‚Äôve basically chosen their own requirements as they‚Äôre covered by public insurance that doesn‚Äôt necessarily follow WPATH and in that province the age of medical consent is 14+.\n\n\nThe only case where top surgery is truly ‚Äúmedically necessary‚Äù is in cases of self mutilation where someone starts the job themselves and medical intervention is needed.

There is an increased risk of tissue damage from not having a foreskin which outweighs that. We have a foreskin for a reason."

I'd say those things outweigh the risks associated with circumcision. Ultimately I think it's a medical decision made by parents, I don't think it's a GAS. You may believe uncut is better for the child, and other people believe that cut is better. I think either one can be argued for, really. It's not like one of them is \"child abuse\" while the other isn't, which is what a lot of people try to claim."

    "comment_body": "I mean, I am in a different situation, a trans woman married to a trans man, but I transitioned first and had considered myself a lesbian before he had told me. I certainly feel like I can relate to what you're feeling right now.\n\nI'm no expert in relationship stuff apart from being with my husband for 12 years now, but I'd say you reacted well.\n\nFor me, I similarly felt like I could never ever leave this person who I had spent 7 years with up to that point. I was also really upset and scared because I had, mistakenly, thought I was only attracted to women. \n\nThat was a silly thing to be upset about - transition is a slow process and I had more than enough time to get used to it gradually. I still don't think I'm very attracted to guys but I love my husband and an certainly attracted to him enough to continue loving him. \n\n My husband hasn't had top surgery yet, though he plans on it. I support him getting surgery, obviously, but I am going to miss his chest once he does. There's been more than enough time for me to say goodbye to them, though, and I'm excited to love him in a body that he feels comfortable in, even if I think I'll miss something now. From my experience thus far, my love for him has trumped every single concern I had in the beginning, so I'm not too worried about that one, either.\n\nI think you are being much more supportive and loving than I was when I was in your situation. \nHonestly it sounds like you've already got it mostly figured out - you love them ostensibly for who they are as a person. & While gender does play a strong role in that, they'll still always be the person you fell in love with and married. There might be bumps on the way but that's natural for every relationship between people on Earth, ESPECIALLY the romantic ones. \n\nIs there anything in particular that you're worrying about? I think you're definitely on the right track, regardless, so keep up the love and support and I'm sure everything will turn out better than any of your fears.\n\nOf course, us both being trans does make a difference in our situations. I was obviously already very familiar with what challenges arise from transition and the struggles that trans people (and our partners, cis or trans!) face in daily life. So maybe I had a bit of an advantage there, but regardless, it's likely going to be a huge learning experience for the both of you, so mistakes might happen on both sides. Again, it sounds like you're on the right track so I think you'll be alright. \n\nSomething my husband mentioned to me to tell you is...keep in mind that if your partner does decide to transition publicly, you'll then be, ostensibly, a gay man. You can protest and claim to be bi, or try to make some \"AKSHULLY\" argument, but let's be honest, society in most places, even America, isn't really at a place to see men dating men as anything but homosexual still, unfortunately. It is something that I think would be good to consider, especially if you're going to promise to never leave, so you can prepare for whatever that may mean with your family and your career.\n\nSomeone else recommended therapy here. That's a good idea if you have concerns about the future & their transition. It didn't help me but if you have the spare income or health insurance, it probably won't hurt.\n\nBest of luck, I hope for many years happily married between the two of you if that's what's right for the both of you, and best of luck to his transition. It can be hard but it's a lot easier with someone who loves you unconditionally, so I'm sure you'll be alright from what I've heard so far."

Gender transition is a pretty major shift in a relationship, so I suggest asking yourself what support you would need for other shifts (ex: move across the country, having a kid, one if you gets disabled) and seek that support. Gender transition is an unusual shift in a relationship because you can see it coming, but the timeline is unpredictable. \n\nMy marriage survived and we‚Äôre even better now than before, but I‚Äôm not sure how much of that is because my husband is pretty unattached to labels and his family is very ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù, versus anything specific we did. I was really nervous about what his family would say and if he‚Äôd realize he was uncomfortable being perceived as gay, but there‚Äôs been nothing to worry about. We‚Äôve had a lot of awkward and emotional conversations to stay in touch throughout the transition process, because sometimes my feelings shifted (example: pre-transition I liked pink, then I didn‚Äôt want anything pink because it felt dysphoric to be seen with pink, now after top surgery I‚Äôm ok with pink again).\n\nSome people will tell you that you need to make a decision based on your sexual orientation, and they‚Äôre probably coming from lived experience where that was important, but not everyone is attached to labels like that. Some partners of trans people identify as gay or straight ‚Äúwith an exception‚Äù, or decide they don‚Äôt really vibe with labels at all. You also don‚Äôt have to decide anything right away if you‚Äôre unsure."

If they decide to medically transition, who knows if you'll still be attracted to them--and sexual folks tend to need that in a relationship. Desiring your partner AND being desired, both matter. \n\nI would recommend therapy for both of you. You deserve support as you process this. Some relationships withstand transitioning, even when one partner is not generally attracted to that gender, but it takes a lot of work and unpacking (questions like how would you feel about being perceived as gay, what will you do when others misgender them, what does treating your partner as their gender identity mean, how do you navigate situations where you accidentally trigger dysphoria, etc). Not all relationships can get through it, even if both people are 100% on board and trying, sometimes they end up being best friends but no longer sexually compatible, which can be devastating all around. You deserve a trans affirming therapist who has experience working with trans folks and their partners."

This is a big change to the nature of the relationship. Love counts for a lot, true, but it's both healthy and completely fair for a change like this to precipitate other changes in the relationship too.\n\nThe way I look at it is this. The both of you face some core questions:\n\n1. Foremost, do you both *want* to stay together? It was a cis/het-appearing relationship when it started. Now it's not. Is that ok with both of you?\n2. What are each of your true needs with respect to the relationship? This can include stuff like companionship, openness, joint decision making, sex, monogamy, shared household duties, etc. For your partner, there is also clearly an element of authentic self-expression involved. Though to be fair, that need is there for you as well, it's just that if you're cis, you've been authentically self-expression since before the two of you met, so that's kind of taken as a given.\n3. How can both of you get your true needs met within the context of the relationship? What rules does the relationship operate under? Do any of those rules need to change in order for both of you to get your needs met? And are you both ok with whatever changes those might be?\n\nAt the end of the day, it's *your* relationship with your spouse. Not mine or society's. Nobody else gets to say how that relationship works except for you and your partner. If you both want to stay together, and can find a set of rules you're both comfortable with that gets everybody's needs met, then yeah! Stay together. If not, well, that really sucks but it's better to just admit it and part on good terms, wishing each other all the best. It's better to move forward along different paths, but paths that do let both of you get your needs met.\n\nAll of this is scary and complicated and hard to talk about. Which is why it's *so* valuable to get a couple's counselor. That's a person who can help the two of you work through all that and figure it out. On a certain level, it's really simple: what do you both want, and what do you both need? But the devil's in the details, and a good counselor can help you through it. Look for one who has experience with gender identity issues, too. That's pretty important, in this situation."

I'm certainly still attracted to my male husband, even though my affection for women also certainly hasnt gone anywhere. \n\nTrashing an otherwise perfectly good relationship because he hasn't ever seen himself as a gay or bisexual man before is not rational or reasonable when he loves his partner and is willing to try new things to remain loving them. \n\nI'm certainly glad I didn't act on that very same knee jerk reaction when my husband came out to me. I certainly thought it, but to have left him five years ago when he first transitioned would have certainly left my life in a worse place now than I currently am in. \n\nI'm really happy to, ostensibly, be a bisexual woman now, even if I was, honestly, deathly terrified of what being married to a man would mean initially when he came out to me.\n\nFinally, I think you might be putting too much stock in labels like \"gay\" or \"straight.\" I know society makes a huge deal about straightness, but as a trans person myself, the fact that human gender and sexuality is weirder in reality than language is capable of describing literally is a fact that I live literally every single day."

He can't read minds any more than the lot of us but if he's ready to listen then there's fun to be had.\n\nRegarding gender dysphoria and penetrative appendages I would advise trying out a strap-on dildo someday. At first I was worried I'd feel like a lesbian when using it, and at the beginning it feels a bit weird, but in the heat of the action I found myself really connecting to it and enjoying using it a lot. Obviously it depends on people but you can't really know until you try it out. Also, you don't even need to operate the dildo with your hips if you don't feel like it, and there's even no need to use a dildo. Penetration is a flexible thing and exploring all the ways to do it can be a good way to find sex that makes everyone feel hot and happy."

And then elaborate if he asks what you mean and say you want to be the one in him lol. It sounds like he's at least mentally ok with both, if initially he said something that sounded like you'd be topping him, but when he was like \"wait, it would be the other way around\" it wasn't because he seemed to be grossed out by him being the bottom, but more just that he assumed your anatomy and assumed it means you're incapable of topping. The issue may wind up being less about if he's ok bottoming (sounds to me like he wouldn't mind either tbh lol), but more so about is he not going to care what you top him with if you'd be using a prosthetic or toy for it. Some people get extra picky, and cis guys especially seem to sometimes be so into flesh things that they are blind to a whole world they are missing out on (when really, it's like, can I change out a flesh dick every other minute during the act, for one of a different texture and size, and are there any flesh dicks shaped like tentacles, and does a flesh dick vibrate? ü§î. Like people who only accept flesh dick and nothing else is like a store only accepting cash and nothing else, they're gonna miss out on a lot of a lot lol, just saying. If he winds up being like that then don't feel bad, it is not your problem, it's his. But he sounds hella into you imo lol, and his comment already comes across to me like he's at least sorta sexually open minded, so he might be likely to not really care about it as long as it's with you and you're both feeling good.)"

Talking about your dysphoria with him, and making sure he understands how you feel in your body sound like the perfect way to then bring up the conversation about how you like to top.\n\nSpeaking of dysphoria, have you considered jock-strap underwear with an O ring, like [this one](https://friskybusinessboutique.com/products/o-jock-harness) or another brand? The reason why I ask is that some (not all) people experience reduced dysphoria by adding visual [reminders of the way you see your body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhHzcVdyvWg)‚Ä¶ by giving the brain permission to think of the phallus as part of the person, it gives the person a chance to be relieved of the burden of dysphoria somewhat. I suggested a jock strap because then you can take your time deciding whether you like the idea of being a sweaty butt-boy for someone (without as much dysphoria complications).\n\nThere are a lot of ways that this can go‚Ä¶ most of them seem good. The worst case scenario is to be stuck in a relationship where both people are missing a perceived need. It‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre taking the time to really understand what each of your needs are."

And, at the same time, since you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, it might be a good idea to explore and see what turns you on.

I know that‚Äôs not good but that‚Äôs how dysphoria does me. I only get dysphoria about my parts in a sexual context. I feel shy about it like I imagine I would if I was a guy with a small dick?

'guys' was a word hit men aaaand maybe it's not super offensive to use it to refer to a woman but if you think about the ingrained patriarchy it does get awkward."

    "comment_body": "Alright, let‚Äôs break it down:\n\n1. **Gendered Language**: Using terms like ‚Äúguys‚Äù can be hurtful because they aren‚Äôt gender-neutral. For example, you wouldn‚Äôt call your male boss ‚Äúsis‚Äù, ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äùor ‚Äúgal‚Äù because it would be inappropriate and offensive.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Historically, masculine terms have been used as ‚Äúneutral‚Äù to make women feel inferior. This is similar to how racism and sexism have persisted over time.\n\n3. **Personal Experience**: I try to avoid gendered terms because they can hurt people. For instance, I went on a date with a trans woman, and the server kept calling us ‚Äúguys.‚Äù This made my friend feel uncomfortable and upset.\n\n4. **Addressing the Issue**: I politely asked the server to stop using ‚Äúguys,‚Äù and she apologized and changed her language. This shows that addressing the issue can lead to positive changes.\n\n5. **Ongoing Effort**: I acknowledge that I still make mistakes but try to correct them and apologize. Some people appreciate it, while others might not mind as much.\n\nIn short, I am trying to be more mindful of language to avoid hurting others and make the world a bit kinder.  You might not ever know how you are breaking someone in the inside because they just walk away."

It was a fun experience for both of us and gave me more insight into which terms I actually do like. I hadn't really sat down and considered most of them before. \n\nAnd like you noted with context, what I've found is while I'm fine with certain terms with close friends and in certain situations, I'm not when it is used in other ways. I'm fine with my friends using the term \"bitch\" in a playful way. I'm fine with the med tech at my primary doctor's office (who I have known for six years) saying \"guuurrrl!\" When she's talking to me. I'm not okay with being ma'amed left and right at work, but there's not much I can do about it. ü§∑ Yeah, context matters, and when in doubt, just ask in an open way and try to honour people's preferences. I try to err on the side of avoiding gendered language unless I know for sure what someone is comfortable with."

I personally wouldn't say any of those terms are gender neutral in most contexts. Ultimately, if the people in your friend group don't care about you referring to them as guys/dudes/bros/whatever, then I wouldn't worry about doing so. You may want to keep in mind that they also just might not want to make a scene and so don't say anything."

Fighting dysphoria or feelings of incongruence doesn‚Äôt work; I know this because I tried for so long to repress my true self. All it did was leave me feeling isolated and deeply unhappy. My life only truly began when I allowed myself to accept who I am.\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve built a beautiful life. I have partners and friends who love and support me. Yes, society can be harsh, and some people can be cruel, but I‚Äôve found a community that gives me strength and solidarity. I‚Äôve also discovered goals and dreams I never would have imagined for myself before.\n\nBeing trans doesn‚Äôt make you a failure. In fact, I think our experiences often give us a deeper connection to what it means to be human.\n\n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre in a really tough place right now, and I want to say it‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed. Try to be kind to yourself, you deserve that. You might reach a point where you‚Äôre ready to take steps on this journey, but if you‚Äôre not there yet, that‚Äôs okay too. The most important thing is learning to live with yourself in a way that feels authentic and sustainable. For most people who are truly trans, transition eventually becomes necessary, but only you can decide what‚Äôs right for you, and that‚Äôs something to navigate at your own pace."

I would burp at the table and my dad would call me the son he never had, and it made me happy. I realized I was nonbinary in university, but I was too scared to look further. I didn't change at all except for telling everyone I was ok with any pronouns. Medically transitioning was something risky and nerve-wracking that I didn't want to consider.\n\nThen I really looked at myself and realized I didn't know who I was. The reflection in the mirror is what others expect me to be. The way I act is how others expect me to. Who I am is something else, a boy and something in between. I want to look like an androgynous boy. I want others to see me as a boy. I don't want that initial hesitation from men because I'm a girl, before they realize I'm like them. I want them to see me for me.\n\nI'm in fandom and have been interested in gay couples in fiction for pretty much my whole life. But now that I turned this switch on in my brain, every time I consume this content I'm always looking at one of the boys and thinking \"I wish I was him\". It especially doesn't help that there's a lot of transmasc content for these couples. I look at it and realize that could be me.\n\nI went through cycles of ignoring any of these thoughts for a long time, then feeling like absolute shit for a few days. It used to happen twice a year, then every few months, all the way to now where I feel like shit pretty much all the time. I tried to suppress it for a long time but I can't anymore.\n\nI'm currently in therapy talking it out. It felt so good to realize transition was a possibility and it might be ok. But now I'm back to wishing I could ignore it all. I'm still in the thick of it. There's work for me to do. And I think that work would be beneficial for you too. I highly suggest therapy with a queer therapist. Because you can try to suppress it like I did, but you'll just be suffering for longer. It hurts and hurts, grows larger and larger, until it fills you up completely. And at that point, you have to make a decision. Live with this pain for the rest of your life, or do something about it."

I was in the same sort of head space as you about a year ago. Heck, I still have moments where I wonder if it would be easier to quit. To just go back to being the man everyone expects me to be‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt. My Pandora‚Äôs box, for better or for worse, has been opened and now I have to navigate life while also relearning who I even am.\n\nI‚Äôm not going to lie, 7 months on HRT and it‚Äôs still really hard. I feel better for sure, but it‚Äôs stressful knowing that it‚Äôs probably only a matter of time until my conservative family notices somethings off. I guess I‚Äôve resigned myself to the possibility many of them won‚Äôt want to speak to me again. And with the current state of politics, it‚Äôs stressful being trans. Stressful is putting it very lightly, but I won‚Äôt spend any more time on that since there‚Äôs too much to be said there. But, I think that I want to die less often, so that‚Äôs something. I also like all of the changes I‚Äôve experienced so far. Starting to come out has also made the relationships with my friends feel more real. Like there‚Äôs no longer a filter separating myself from them in order to appear cis.\n\nAnd I promise you. Not a single person has ever WANTED to be trans. I wanted to be a woman, but that just meant that I was a weak man, not one of those crazy transgender people. Besides, I told myself, I would make an ugly girl so it didn‚Äôt matter. Even if I could transition, which I wouldn‚Äôt, it would just make me uglier‚Ä¶ like even more of a freak than I already was. I tried other stuff. I lost myself in books, movies, games, porn. Anything to try and fill the void that felt like it was eating me alive from the inside out. The vast emptiness that was my soul. I‚Äôm overweight, so I tried cutting back. Exercising more. I told myself I was uncomfortable in my skin because I was too big. So I lost almost 50 pounds‚Ä¶ and still felt wrong.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt escape my transness. And I think I always knew that deep down. But hey, maybe you can, that‚Äôs a choice for you to make. And, maybe you‚Äôre not trans at all, it‚Äôs totally possible you‚Äôll be content with the exploration you‚Äôve done and move on. I‚Äôm not saying any of this to try and sway you one way or the other. But I know that hearing directly from somebody that had felt like I did would have, at the very least, helped me feel less alone.\n\nFor right now though, take a breath, you‚Äôre ok. You have plenty of time to get all of this figured out. If you don‚Äôt want to explore anything right now, that‚Äôs ok. Figuring out who you are is a process that can move as quickly or as slowly as you need it to. And even if these thoughts don‚Äôt go away, there‚Äôs a whole community of people who have felt what you‚Äôre feeling and made it out ok."

And thus they hid in the closet.\n\n\nThe closet is not denial. A queer person in the closet knows and accepts their queerness - just keeps it private for safety. They also work with loved ones and other queer people in order to maintain the appearance of cishetness - while allowing space in their life for their queerness.\n\n\nA gay man in the mid 20th century would have had a lover. He would just also have had a beard who pretended to be a girlfriend/wife.\n\n\nSimilarly - being trans and in the closet is not about stopping the thoughts - its about making space in your private life to be trans (dressing the way you want, names, pronouns... even up to the point of medically transitioning if you want) while keeping a facade of cishetness.\n\n\nIs this for you? That I cannot tell you. It is not easy nor perticularly mentally healthy, and I would only suggest doing it if you MUST to survive.¬†\n\n\nOne thing I suggest is not thinking about the closet as defeat but instead every private moment of queerness as a victory. You are a cocoon and once it is safe you can emerge as a butterfly.\n\n\nRepression... will backfire in the long run from almost every experience of trying it that I have heard.

    "comment_body": "I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you are truly transgender, the feelings only get stronger as time goes by. I also tried to run away from those feelings by doing hyper masculine things like joining the military, started getting a lot of tattoos, rode motorcycles, got heavily into the drag racing world, got married, had kids, and worked as an automotive mechanic. I worked hard as hell to hide my feelings until I had enough and attempted suicide a few times. Beginning my transition at 44 years old pretty much saved my life. I fully transitioned a decade ago and never looked back, and I have zero regrets either.  Going through a transition is probably the hardest thing anyone could ever do, until you learn how to stop caring about what anyone thinks about you, things will be much more difficult. I recommend getting counseling with a mental health professional that has been trained and experienced in treating transgender people. Nobody in their right mind would ever want to be transgender. Transgender people are among the most hated people on the planet. Who would really like that? The reason why I waited so long to transition was I was waiting for the right time in my life to begin. I didn't want to be a disappointment to my family and friends. There is no right time to transition, something will always get in the way. You gotta want it and commit to sticking with it. After the first few years things will get much easier."

It maybe be that you are totally correct, that you are not transgender, but still have something going on. And the only word you have been given so far is trans. That is totally ok. You're not transphobic for stating you don't want to be transgender. You're not transphobic for checking to see if it's something else. You're not transphobic, if you find it you are in fact trans, and you still sore about it. Your allowed to scream in total pissy frustration when it's just not working. \n\nI suggest to find a good councilor. Someone willing to balance affirmation with professional integrity. Someone who is willing to look for all possible causes, including, but not limited to, transgender. You might be, you might not. Don't hesitate to find a second and third opinion. I'd be wary of love bombing, and diagnosis after only one meeting. Though you'll probably be fine since most councilors would rather risk being called prejudice, then risk improper diagnosis and loss of license. \n\nI do not suggest just ignoring it. You are human not a god. Great people throughout time have lost the battle against oppressive stress. Once you know what going on. Then you can treat it properly. Or even ignore it more effectively if you determined to. It's easier to break a machine if you know how the machine functions right? \n\nRight now you're fighting shadows buddy. You need to turn around and face the light. Then you'll know which shadows you need to address. You got this. Listen to some aggressive music. Get the frustration out of your system. Then take a deep and tackle this. \n\nIf you eventually choose to embrace this. What ever it turns out to be. Find your elders. The people who have lived the longest with what you got going on. If it turns out you are transgender, my biggest advice is to get support from transwomen who have been trans for many years. They might be a bit hard to find. After a while a lot of trans people just want to be left alone, even by other trans folk. Don't hesitate to ask them for honest opinion on matters. Be prepared to hear what you'd rather not hear. These people have been living this for years. They'll know what to do. \n\nPlease don't give up. That's all I'd dare ask in the end. Everything is your choice. It's in your hands. You hold the Sceptre, you hold the Crown, you are your own Empire. \n\nIf anyone here has a problem with acknowledging there are other people out there with similar symptoms to transgender people. They can PM me. I've got all night. And no more F to give."

If you didn't care then you wouldn't be bothered to come here for support.\n\nSince this sub is called Ask Transgender, I spent some time re reading your post to really ponder the questions you want answered. I want to address the two most important with the best encouragement and experience I can offer. \n\n- How do I stop being trans?\n- Why do I want and not want to be trans? \n\nBoth questions are directly linked to discomfort. You are caught between two difficult states. One part of you feels dissatisfied with where you are in life right now. The other part recognizes the very real discomforts of what it will cost to undertake a transition journey. For now, you are at a standstill, but there is no relief.\n\nIn situations like these, I have learned to see the freedom of choice. No matter what you choose, there will be discomfort and hardship and sacrifice. So you are free to do whatever you like. And I always encourage that you choose the type of discomfort that improves your life. Some choose to accept the discomfort of trying to please others because they decide that is more valuable to them. Some choose to embrace the changes even if it means others will be upset by it. Just do what is best for you. \n\nThe one thing you can't change is how you feel. Your emotions are immediate and internal. Feel them, reflect on them, let them speak to you. Find what causes them. Knowing yourself will always help you navigate life's twists and turns a little bit better.\n\nAs for a direct answer to those two questions, I'll leave you with this. I don't believe you can stop being trans. You either are or aren't, and how you express yourself is within your power. It sounds like you might consider taking steps toward transition if not for the people and circumstances in your life that would cause friction if you did. Imagine yourself in a life where you were only surrounded by support and care. How would you feel then? \n\nI hope this helps and you are able to find some peace. All the best. -AJ"

So you walk the normal path and have a kid or two however many years in the future. If they have tendencies like you've had, would you not want them to have the choices you didn't give yourself? \nThe American government is succumbing to turning the world blind by not allowing choice. \nNot for them, nor their loved ones or future children. \nThis is theft of lives on a scale these people can't count up to.\nIt may not be as pressing a question as preventing dictatorships or whatever varied their other causes may be, but this is still theft of lives and happiness from the people.\nIn Turn leading towards a theft of productivity which affects whatever governments.\nThose people who could have been happy are instead medicated, on welfare or state hospital cares, are locked out of having a happy life. BUT are still alive. Only they are prone to being ashamed, depressed, feeling like they'll never belong, hating systems, potentially exhibiting abusive behaviours due to lack of therapy, this repressing the self, never accepting or coming to terms with the self but running from it. Then getting with someone, caring for them and not exhibiting abusive behaviours, but passing the unfulfilled patterns onto whatever children are made.\nThere is a very clear downward spiral which will follow with all of the repression of self these governments want to enforce.\nNo matter which gender you choose, your SPINE and heart will still define you. For your sake, lead with your spine and heart and mind in what you choose. \nDon't put the lead around your own neck and ask for someone else to shape your life. You should be old enough to make this choice for yourself. \n\nThe question is: Are You worth fighting for? I would say YES.\n\n The problem IS NOT YOU. \n\nIt is the government which wants to entrench its people so heavily that they never fight back. DON'T BUY IN.\nThere ARE good governments that actually care about their people. BUT in some places people have been fear-mongered into not trusting their government to do what is right for their people. Those people in power have not fought hard enough to care for others recently for fear of being called a socialist or liberal, etc, or those with the power have been bought off to say nay and look the other way instead. This is what we must fight now. This is why trans rights matter. We should be holding up the banner instead of running from the pitchforks. Every able-bodied person should be. There may be singular situations that those with different mindsets bring to the forefront but THEY DO NOT SPEAK FOR THE WHOLE.\n\nYour life and happiness is worth fighting for, whether male or female, trans or not. \nI hope you make the right choice for you, but know the hardest-earned things give the best reward."

If it‚Äôs upsetting, or depressing, or if you‚Äôre not in a good place, emotionally or physically, to wrestle with it, you can totally set the whole question aside and focus on something else. It might keep coming up for you, or you might have to sort it out for yourself down the road, but there is zero rush in putting a name or label on your gender. \n\nIt‚Äôs never too late to transition if you eventually decide you want to, and if you do, it doesn‚Äôt have to be an all or nothing thing: you can try hormones for a bit and go off them, buy some girly clothes and wear them once in your room and then toss them out‚Äîthere‚Äôs no pressure. Though the button question is an interesting thought experiment, it doesn‚Äôt actually work like that in real life! Figuring out your gender, even if you figure out you‚Äôre cis, doesn‚Äôt have to be a one and done, yes/no deal.\n\nMostly I just really feel for you. Questioning shit like this is really hard, and there‚Äôs not really much you can do to make it easier‚Äîit just takes mental energy and time. For what it‚Äôs worth, in my experience life is made up of life altering shit after life altering shit, and it‚Äôs all about moving through it and growing and learning and coming out the other side better than you were. Regardless of where you land, you‚Äôve got strangers on the internet who care about you."

No one wants to go through transitioning, and all the literal pains that go with it. Spending all that time, locked inside your own thoughts, and attempting to validate and invalidate yourself all at the same time. It truly is a struggle that I don't wish on anyone. We get indoctrinated at a very young age (in most cases, not all) that being anything other than what you are born as, is just wrong, invalid, or not even possible. \n\nI went into my transition, and quite honestly prepared myself to lose everything, my wife/kids included. I'm not going to lie and tell you it's all roses, even though at first it kinda was (I didn't actually have any friends or family that just physically walked away at the time I told them), but I had some people that distanced themselves more and more, I had parents that supported Trump and couldn't understand why their grandchildren (my kids) suddenly weren't as enthusiastic about visiting them anymore, or why my wife and I wouldn't leave our kids with them anymore, to the point they couldn't understand why supporting Trump meant they really didn't support me, my decision, or if I'm honest, care if I was alive... I walked out on my parents at that point, and I'm still dealing with mental ramifications of that decision.\n\nI've been fortunate. I'm well off, a bit older, but was able to transition relatively easily. However, I can say this right now, when I look back, even knowing it means I might not have married my wife or even had kids (that I do love), I wish I had realized and recognized I was trans 20 years ago, or more. Life would've been harder from that point forward, but.....I get the feeling I might have also been happier long term as well.\n\nYou sound like you're questioning yourself, and sounds like you have a desire deep down to be trans, but you're going through that same terrible stage where you know you don't want to immediately make your life much harder. And thinking that you can't handle that, or that you might be scared of having to handle it, is perfectly valid and normal if you ask me. But, if you're thinking the things you say you are.....I'd wager your egg has cracked and those feelings will be with you for the next 20+ years as you grow older if you don't explore it now. And as someone who understands those feelings now....I wish I had done this 20+ years ago.\n\nJust some food for thought I suppose. I'm 44 years old now, just for reference."

I lived in a small town in a red state, so in-person connections were hard to come by, but the internet helped a lot. Platforms like Reddit, Susan's Place, and state-specific Discord servers (like one for trans rights in Ohio) connected me with affirming spaces. Now that I live in a queer-friendly city, getting involved in activism, attending events, and joining spaces like my trans women‚Äôs book club has been transformative.\n\nExploring my spirituality also helped me connect with myself. I found Wicca, which deepened my relationship with my femininity and introduced me to a wonderful queer community. For example, tonight I‚Äôll celebrate Yule with other queer witches. Spirituality, even outside of religion, can be a great way to feel grounded and supported.\n\nAs a plus-sized woman, I relate to your feelings about body image. Transitioning helped me appreciate and care for my body in ways I never thought possible. I‚Äôve learned that being bigger doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not beautiful! it‚Äôs about embracing who I am and honoring the woman I‚Äôve always been. Part of that is also honoring the little girl I never got to be and giving her the love and joy she deserved.\n\nThis journey hasn‚Äôt been easy. I‚Äôve lost people who couldn‚Äôt support me, but I‚Äôve also built deeper connections and found an incredible chosen family. Some relatives surprised me by staying in my life, too. I spent decades trapped in self-hatred until I faced a choice: stop existing or radically accept myself. I chose acceptance, and while I regret the time I lost, I‚Äôve found peace.\n\nEveryone deserves happiness and self-acceptance, this is the only life we have. If you ever have questions or need to talk, feel free to DM me (as long as you‚Äôre an adult). Lastly, finding a good therapist you trust is crucial‚Äîit can truly be life-saving.\n\nYou‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôve got this. üíúüéÄ‚ú®Ô∏è"

And whatever is going on in your head right now will be affected by so many experiences and emotions and self development and how you perceive things might dramatically change towards hopefully better ways of coping and understanding. My tip would be, feel free to explore yourself honestly and safely, take as much time as you need, and just slow down on any seemingly permanent decisions. If I were you and felt hesitant about a big decision like that, I‚Äôd rather take my time and allow my mind and self to have a better understanding of what‚Äôs really going on in it and why and then see how I will feel then. Everything in life comes with hardships and we gotta choose our hard, so maybe don‚Äôt rush in choosing your hard until you know inside you that you are doing the right thing, and despite how annoying I know it can be being from a conservative family myself, at the end of the day they‚Äôre the only family you got and they do love you despite any possible disagreements and sometimes much to our dislike they have a point we can‚Äôt see early enough.

The reason this worked for me is because I could write literally anything I needed to write without judgement (no one has ever been allowed to read them or it defeats that purpose).\n\nIf I felt negatively about myself, I would write that feeling down then look at it and ask myself whether this feeling is caused by my fear of others or something inside me. It is awful how much of my life was influenced by fear of others opinions. I slowly started to break away from that when I recognized it was a problem in my life. Its really hard when being judged is so deeply ingrained, you start to do it to yourself and become your own enemy. \n\nIn my writing, I found a new voice that let me find the good things about myself, or opportunities I could take to improve things about myself I didn't like. And it was all in the privacy of the journals. Not only did it help me to write, but it helps me in the present because I can look back and see that many of the things that felt impossible did not end up being as severe as they felt at that time. I can see how I have grown and changed over time and that helps me remember I am not stagnant. \n\nWriting in a journal or diary might not be the exact thing for you, but there is some outlet you can find that will accomplish the same thing. Having private alone time to think, having a close trusted friend you can speak with, pursuing a hobby that gives you peace, are all things I have done as well and help in similar ways."

Now, being trans and borderline is tough because I have always had issues with how I look, but I've also had a huge incongruence between being born in a male body versus living in a female mind. So, with the borderline, i have a lot of struggles when it comes to self image and who I want to be. But after addressing my borderline personality disorder, I saw that I still had dysphoria about my gender. Like, I was struggling with all these things that fit into the borderline category, and addressed them and relieved those symptoms, but I still needed to be a woman. I'm not sure if that helps, but maybe it's another angle to look at. Again, I am not a psychiatrist I cannot diagnose you I am just speaking off of my own personal experience."

Some times of the month I get more like a guy -- and I feel emotionally more distant and \"tough\" but at the same time I can usually feel the girl part of me and I can remind myself that she exists, and that I'm still planning transition. Although when I'm \"masc\" my memories of being a trans woman are dulled and I'm sort of distant from her. My diary has shown gender fluidity for years and I routinely log my feelings \"today I felt like a guy\" or \"today I felt like something else.\" Slowly I came to realize that the \"masc\" side of me may not be an actual gender. I belong to a gender fluid group and several people had almost identical experiences. Some have up to 5 personalities, even with its own gender. That's pretty normal actually. Check out people who have \"alters.\""

You can only press it one time, and there‚Äôs no going back. Would you press it? If your answer is yes, that‚Äôs a strong indication you might be trans. Cis people generally don‚Äôt think about becoming another gender like that. For the longest time, I assumed everyone felt that kind of longing, but I eventually realized that‚Äôs not the case."

Like today I am feeling almost agender even mildly masc, as I often do, but still feel more comfy thinking I'm a trans woman and I know later today I will enjoy shopping for womens clothes. And yet I stopped thinking I'm gender fluid because the fem side of me is happier... consistently."

Sometimes I don't want to think about being trans, and wear girly things that look good with my body shape and boobs (this especially happens during the summer when I can't wear clothes that cover a lot of me - I run hot). Sometimes it's neutrality and maybe even apathy towards my body, where I don't particularly mind my boobs or body shape being the way it is, but I still feel comfortable calling myself transmasc. One those days, I lean more towards preferring they/them. Then some days there's a trigger and suddenly I'm so incredibly sad that no one sees me as a guy. I put my binder on and wear baggy clothes to look more like a guy, and maybe even some makeup to contour my face. These are the days I get some dysphoria about my chest and my voice making people think I'm a girl. Then, a few days later, I'm back to one of my other fluctuations."

I never got to have periods though I do have regular monthly cramps.¬† (They're only for a day, and obviously not all that severe because I don't have anything to push out of a uterus I don't have.)

I was going to be a priest (my brother continued onward and is the priest of some diocese in New Jersey), but I got involved in fast racing machines... and the girls that hung around those machines were faster than the machines, so that took care of being a priest. Besides, they all had the body I wanted. (And I didn't begin taking estrogen until I was 57!)\n\nLook, you have everything to live for. I just had the most incredibly wonderful orgasms with my girlfriend and her boyfriend - and I'm 72.¬†\n\nSo go to college, study your butt off and learn something, get a degree that proves it - and get a job with compensation that you deserve. Nobody gives a damn whether you're a male or a female as long as you can do the work. (Okay, okay I'm in Florida... And DeSantis is still the governor, and he's screwing up the state royally - but that's for your generation to straighten out. Won't be long and I'm out of here.)\n\n\nMy advice? Quit worrying. That... is *truly*¬† pointless; imagine yourself some goals to accomplish, then go make them happen.¬†\n\n\nLife doesn't get any better than that. I promise. And that's enough.

You wanna know why? Because ***it's just dysphoria***! And dysphoria is alleviated with transitioning. I am probably one of the bitchiest trans girls out there about my transition. I still get dysphoric over not being able to birth my own child, over my body and face's proportions and attractiveness, over not having lived that youth period as a girl. But it's fine. I don't want to live a day as my AGAB, I'm happier now than before, I am far less dysphoric than before, and I have no regrets about transitioning (and trust me, I am someone who harbors a lot of regrets in life, I'm no monk).

From 18 years old to now, l've been entirely secluded (and would have been before that too, if I hadn't been forced to be around others, due to things like school). I decided in my mid-teens that I would not live a lie, so I really never had a life where I pretended to be my assigned at birth gender (male). I was referred to as that, but I never made any attempt to live up to the expectations people have for people of that gender.\n\nBut, even though I never lived as a man, had I done so, I'd have considered that just as much a waste of my life, as the life I've had, being generally isolated from any social interaction. And at least this way only my life got ruined, and not any potential partners/kids I may have had, if I'd decided to live a lie. The way I see it, as devestating and lonely as my existence has been, I think I'd have suffered even worse if I'd tried to shut away my true self."

Perverts! Groomers!

Today, we are exactly where society was when it was Illegal for white people to marry black people, or for black people to use white people's restrooms, water fountains, or doctors' waiting rooms. My own mother was racist: \"*I'm* not going to sit on a toilet that some black woman parked her butt on; there's no telling what kind of diseases...\"\n\nMother eventually grew up and became more mature; at the end of her life, her most favorite person on the entire Earth was a black woman who did some shopping etc for her ‚Äì Mother truly loved her like a daughter. Point of all this is: The pendulum of Life swings back and forth.\n\nIt was getting better for us around 2000; by 2012 N.C. passed its \"Bathroom Bill\" which was soon rescinded, then, Trump came on the scene and made it possible for people's ugliness to be spoken out loud. He will try to take it further, but I believe enough people now see us as *just* people trying to live our lives... and with some transgender persons now in Congress, it simply has to get better.\n\nDon't be afraid to be You, whoever that is.

It takes time to build that but one can even if it means moving state or country. \n\nI was fortunate to be in relationships with other trans people of different gender, booth before my transition and after and also had a hookup with a great cis guy and they all like me as I was and really liked body.  \n  \nAafter all the surgeries and HRT I disassociate way less with my body and even like parts of it , my hair, eyes, expensive nose lol, vagina etc but still I could cry some days that I am not as petite as I want to be or that my hands are larges etc. In my mind I just always was this petite girl/woman. Not this warrior amazon woman lol. Its hard.

Labia are usually darker than the surrounding tissue, so HRT makes the \"seam\" along the base of your penis and scrotum darker than the surrounding tissue as well.

    "comment_body": "a \"period\" is a lot of things happening in a woman's body centered around fertility and hormone cycling. As pointed out by the overconfident moron below, trans women do not have a uterus obviously, so some parts of what happens won't take place, like shedding the lining of an organ you don't have.\n\nOn the other hand, the rest of your body has no way of knowing that you don't have a uterus, and the hormone signals in your body still make it think you have a woman's body (because you do) so sometimes people will still experience some of the secondary period symptoms. For instance, the abdominal cramping that women tend to experience is primarily in the uterus, but not only there. Those cramps are caused by chemical signals telling the smooth muscle tissues to release prostaglandins, and the uterus is not the only place those signals end up going. This is why it's very common to experience \"the period shits\" and intestinal cramping as well as the classic uterine cramping.\n\n>There are several typical period pain causes:\n\n>First, during menstruation, the uterus contracts to expel its inner lining (the endometrium). As a result, the blood vessels are compressed, which causes a temporary lack of oxygen and provokes the discomfort.\n\n>Second, throughout the menstrual cycle, uterine tissues accumulate prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that intensify uterine contractions. The higher the level of prostaglandins, the more severe the pain. Prostaglandins accumulate in other smooth muscle tissues, for example, in those of the bronchi or intestines, which is why painful periods are often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  \n  \n\\-Excerpt from [This Article](https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/health/period/period-pain-relief)\n\nPersonally I get the diarrhea, intestinal cramping, mood changes (irritability, way worse anxiety), hormonal migraines, sometimes a random other symptom or two depending on the month.\n\n... if someone wants to call all the other aspects of a period (other than the bleeding) something besides a period, they are welcome to. Certainly this is not something that happens to every trans woman. But I'm not interested in being told I have to use separate language and terminology when I experience something very normal and typical of an adult woman.\n\nHere's [another link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230128162842/https://curvyandtrans.com/p/C4BD87/cycle-dynamics) that goes into a lot more depth on the subject. I did have to use the way-back machine to find an archived copy because the original site is apparently offline now."

This was enough for her to be called upon by the newly-installed Reagan administration to testify on killing funding for access to gender-affirming surgeries at teaching and research hospitals funded by the U.S. government.\n\n\nDo you have more information on this? This is the first time hearing about it, but I'm not surprised at all."

Arguing with one brings them \"great pleasure\". \n\nWhen you argue with one of these weird hate-animals, not only are you harming yourself, you are making the TERF \"feel good\". (In their own way ofc. TERFs can't actually feel good as we understand it.) The act is very productive and life affirming for the TERF.\n\nRegardless of your own mental stability, simply for the good of the community, please don't feed the TERFs. Instead, use your energy protecting their natural prey, to starve the TERFs of valuable nutrients."

I do something similar with fascists. I accept the fash are rapist rabid dogs but there is understanding in a rabid dog too. (They bite because they flip between excitable and lethargic types of brain damage)\n\n\nI will be honest speaking with them is often not helpful. They don't understand themselves in the way that I do.\n\n\nFor me the current one I struggle with is \"I think TERFs have a hatred of certain kinds of femininity\" They despise the feminine where it applies to sex work and specifically drawing the male gaze... They also despise non-white expressions of femininity, and they hate transwomen whom express femininity... \n\nTheir behaviour shows it's only Rhetorical their semantic definitions they HATE looking at feminine trans women. Conversely many of them accept certain white non-standard forms of femininity. Butch academics begin prominent in their movement. And they often adore the \"Republican woman\" aesthetic.\n\n\n\nI want to understand this specific selection or emotive core they operate by that determines what is an acceptable femme in their mind. How is their supremacist doctrine structured?"
