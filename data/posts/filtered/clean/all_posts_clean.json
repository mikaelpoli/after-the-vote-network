I\u2019m not exaggerating. I watched him gobble 2 turkey legs, 2 breasts, so much stuffing, 5 giant helpings of mashed potatoes, a shit-ton of green beans, and our entire helping of cranberry sauce. It was insane. His sister watched, jaw agape. I am not making this post to police his eating habits, but I\u2019ve genuinely never seen this before. He told me it might\u2019ve been a side effect of T, but he\u2019s been on T for years and this has never happened before. Semi-worried about him, but let me know if there\u2019s nothing to be worried about! \n\nHe said it was okay for me to post, because he was also kind of unsure.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies! Found out what happened, though. Turns out he was stoned and completely forgot. What a man.",

    "selftext": "Well hi my name is Corey I'm 23 amab I had a pretty normal childhood I think....I was the fraternal twin to my brother. I never really compared myself with him as we got along really well. But my life started to change around the time of puberty. My brother developed normally but I was a late Bloomer. I was always confused about my own identity since I had the sex ed talk in fifth grade. I noticed that I didn't have the changes that many of my peers had. This was around the time I heard what transgender was. Their was this girl with the same name as me fighting for bathroom Rights in school. That was the moment I really became fascinated with the whole experience. I watched every YouTube video, timelines , make up, boy to girl etc.\n\n\n As I began to crack my egg so to speak I started to keep my hair long and paint my nails with nail polish I bought at dollar tree.. I always had a stash of girly things hidden in my room scared of being found out. I thought I was just a sick pervert.\n\n But as the years passed my family just thought I was gay. I was always flamboyant since I was younger so they were sort of excepting. As I gotten my first job at a major retail store during my last year in highschool 2019.  I began to buy more and more feminine clothes then I dyed my hair burgundy red. Mixing that with having to wear a mask most people didn't think I was a man ironically getting mis gendered in embarrassing ways. Customer's would say that a woman helped them then my coworker's would correct them as I came back to help. This really made me feel wonderful hearing she and her then swiftly getting stabbed in my heart at my coworker's words. \n\nThat was when I started hrt. Then I got scared of how fast the changes happened so I stopped treatment.  Trying to make myself be as masculine as my brother. I began to get into sports and helping him with his car. But I felt like I was going against my nature. So these last few months I have begun to secretly transition again... Mostly due to me getting my first apartment finally away from my family. \n\nSo I have been really happy with how it's going. But then I got my first tattoo recently and it wouldn't heal so I went to the dermatologist and found out that I have psoriasis and they prescribed me humira a biologic to help with my skin... But I had to get a full panel of blood work. Before I could get my prescription. Then I went back to my dermatologist for my follow up appointment and for them to show me how to use the injection properly.\n\n That's when they ask me for my preferred pronouns probably because I was dressed pretty fem and I let them know about my hrt. That's when my dermatologist asked me why I was on it. I said that I was transitioning she then asked me if it was a typo because it said estradiol then she said that was strange for a biological Female... I then stated that I was born male at birth she looked at me confused then as we discussed different things she then came to the conclusion for me to get a chromosome test done and Lord behold I am intersex female and my parents knew about it and never told me... Here I am thinking I'm going through this wholesome process of self discovery then bam the answer to the feelings about my own identity and why I always felt off.\n\n I really can't tell you how much this revelation has changed how I feel about myself.. I am for all intensive purposes. Female not just something in my mind but my entire being. Now I have even greater issues because I don't know if I can identify as trans but I am transitioning.... I really don't know what I should do moving forward?\n\n(*every one's experience is valid I was not referring to it just being in anyone's mind just how I felt)\n\nUpdate: so I just had an appointment today with a specialist. I was formally diagnosed as a pseudo female hermaphrodite. Ps I don't like that terminology\n\nAlso was diagnosed with CAH : congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  Which is why I had some minor male puberty development...\n\nI also want to say thank you All for your support and suggestions.  I was and still processing all this new information about my body and am in the process of figuring out my next steps...\n\nI will start identifying as both trans and intersex.. mostly because it's easier to just tell them I'm trans than having to explain something I'm still confused about myself. I already have had issues discussing this stuff with my family. Ps I'm not talking to my parents until we can all go to therapy.",

I've never interacted with a lot of lgbt people before, I've been neutral to you guys to be honest, hope that doesn't come off as rude, but I'm willing to learn.\n\nI've been straight my entire life. Young, old, middle-age, doesn't matter as long as it's a she. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a few months now, and I find her to be one of the best things to happen to me. She's funny, sweet, sassy, smart, and kinda wholesome.\n\nLike, one time she went to one of my amateur boxing bouts, I took a pretty nasty shot to my ribs (yeah, I lost that fight \ud83d\ude2d) and I was limping afterwards and my lip was bleeding. She wouldn't leave my side no matter what, and even put my arm around her shoulder to help me move around. She scolded twice for forgetting to study for two tests, but let me cheat off her paper \ud83d\udc80\n\nI never really knew she was trans, to me she's a normal girl, she looks like a pretty girl, she acts like a girl, and she sounds like a girl. My God, the doctor who was responsible needs a big raise. She always squieks when I sometimes slap her behind playfully.\n\nSo, how did I find out she was trans? Her older sister told me. It was a huge shock, because I always thought that the little boy in her family pictures was her older brother who died, but nope, that was her.\n\nWhen I confronted her about it, she started to tear up and ran away, I just stood there like a moron dumbfounded. Her sister called me, my gf blew up at her. Sister told me that gf never told me because she was terrified at how I'd react and she was ashamed. Why would she be ashamed?\n\nIt's been a day now, and she's been avoiding me. Her sister told me to give her some space, cuz she'll talk to me eventually. I don't really care about what sex she was born as, I love her, that's what I care about. Ngl, I still find her hot.\n\nEDIT: I apologize for sounding gross. Thank you for the advice. I mean no ill intent, I promise. As for how I confronted her, we were talking one day and I asked her \"that little boy in the pictures at your house, that's you, right?\" and then it extended from there.\n\n**UPDATE:** She texted me now! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4c we're meeting up tomorrow! I'm gonna get her flowers",

They exchanged numbers, then she told him she was trans. He is now asking other men if it should be a law that trans women have to disclose the fact that they're trans before kissing someone, because he is now \"disgusted\" with the whole experience. \n\nObviously this is blatantly transphobic, but they genuinely don't view it that way (most likely because they have little to no experience with trans people). I am not trans, but I wanted to know how you all viewed this scenario and how you approach these things with people in real life knowing that there are people who think this way.\n\nFrom where I stand as a gay, cis man, I genuinely wouldn't have a problem with kissing someone and enjoying my time with them and then finding out he's a trans man. Like, why would I care? All we did was kiss, and I literally enjoyed it? So why would I suddenly change my mind just because I found out he's trans? He still looks and acts exactly like the hot guy I thought he was back when I was kissing him, and that's still how I view him, even if I now know he has a vagina. So I seriously don't get it whenever straight men like the one who posted that are \"disgusted\" afterwards. \n\nOther straight, cis men in the comments are saying it's akin to sexual assault and/or coercion because he was manipulated/deceived by her. I don't think that counts as deception at all. He pursued \\*her\\* because he thought she was attractive. He enjoyed kissing her the whole time. She did everything right, before they actually went home together and got sexual she told him she was trans so that he knew what to expect. Then he changed his mind and has since been \"disgusted\". I don't know how to tell these people that, no, you were not \"lied to\" or \"deceived\" by her. Gender and sex aren't the same thing, and the fact that you confuse cis and trans women literally proves that. So if you were attracted to \\*her\\* as a person and now you're not solely because you found out she's trans, that doesn't mean she \"deceived you\". \n\nDo you know what I'm trying to say here? I need someone to put this into better words than me. Why does it bother me that straight, cis men are calling this \"deception\"? And what exactly are they so disgusted by? The OP of that post literally said he is totally fine with trans people and treats them with respect, but I feel like that can't be true if he was disgusted by that experience.",

Feel free to laugh at me for this, just please be kind.\n\nI (21ftm) was at a party where I met a friend of a friend (35m) and we got to talking. Went out to his truck for a cigarette, and in talking about being queer (he expressed he was bisexual with a preference for women) I told him I was trans. He expressed that it would be \"fun to get me off\" and spoke to me as a man the whole time. He talked a bunch of shit about how he can go for hours and his dick would change my life, but I honestly just wanted some good sex, so I went and met him at his place.\n\nWithin the first couple of minutes, he told me to take my binder off and \"show him my t*ts.\" Throughout intercourse, he called me \"good girl\" multiple times and told me I \"sing like a woman.\" He also said at one point \"I can't see your beard in the dark, so that's a plus.\" He did not touch my clit one time and I came nowhere close to orgasm. He fell asleep shortly after his orgasm, and I left feeling angry, disgusted, and completely unsatisfied.\n\nI want to make it very clear that I understand each person is responsible for their own orgasm during sex, it's no one's job to make you cum. I also understand that at any point I could have called stop, but I felt a sense of obligation once I had started. My question for fellow trans people is this: is this normal? Is it normal to be suddenly misgendered during sex by someone who has been fully respectful of you up to that point? Is it something you have to just accept if you want to sleep with cis people? Seriously considering going t4t only because of this. \n\n\nEDIT: I have evidently been fed bad information regarding the \"each person is responsible for their own orgasm\" statement, so I retract that in full. Thank you to everyone for all of your advice and support!",

I said i would never be with a girl as im not attracted to women. She said \u201cwould you be with a masculine lesbian\u201d and i said \u201cno\u201d and she says, \u201cis that not what (my partners name) is? Its really annoying because my partner is a MAN. \n\nthis girl isnt outright disrespectful or rude, but for some reason does not see this guy as a man like i do. We havent known him pre transition and its really annoying for his gender and my sexuality to not be valid to her. She doesn\u2019t have a problem with me seeing this guy, she just, doesnt see him as a guy. She doesnt misgender him (i mean she uses the correct name and pronouns) but i just dont understand why she doesnt treat him like if i was seeing anyone else. \n\nI know theres not much i can do here, im just wondering if anyone has any tips on trying to change her mind? Or should i not even bother",

    "selftext": "So I (38ftm) regularly attend trans-inclusive adult play parties. When I attend I am usually the only ftm, but I don\u2019t mind. I just love attending to get my needs met. \n\nI have always been friendly with everyone at the events and I even thought I was making friends with a bunch of the trans women. \n\nWell the last two events, I couldn\u2019t shake this feeling that all the women were giving me the cold shoulder. Later on I asked one of them what was going on and she told me that a bunch of the trans women don\u2019t like me because they say I steal all the men from them. \n\nAnd a few of the more passing women, really really don\u2019t like me because I have not had top surgery yet (I am planning to in 2025 \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc), but they also don\u2019t like the trans women that are at the beginning of their journeys. The criticism from the women that have had the most surgeries seems like bs because every has their own gender goals AND every one has to start somewhere. You don\u2019t automatically wake up fully \u201ctransitioned\u201d whatever that means. \n\nBut anyway, I\u2019m so sad to find out this information. I really like the women in my community AND I want to be in community with them\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense. I am not competing. At these adult parties it\u2019s about having consensual fun, and I want everyone to have a good time. \n\nI\u2019m really sad that my actions are being taken negatively..\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do next. Any advice?",

For a bit, I felt comfortable with her and I thought I might be able to actually open up with her later, but right when got over to her apartment (where she lives with her husband and child) I immediately felt a sense of dread and almost horror as I saw a big Trump 2024: Take Back America flag hanging on the window inside.\n\nIt completely doured how much potential I saw for their to still be a chance to bridge the gap between my sister and finally find an ally in my family somehow. It also didn't help that the first thing I saw when I got their was her husband playing Call of Duty on his PS5 and then (a bit later) some yelling at his kid for getting a bit too excited to see me their and acting too hyper (he's a very actively hyper kid overall). \n\nAll of this is to say, I don't really know what to do. My sister asked me if I was alright at certain points due to me phasing out, and I just told her I was alright. They weren't hateful towards me (neither her or her husband), nor did they seem to draw attention to it or bring it up in any way. I even tried taking a picture to show to one of my friends, which my sister seemed to catch, and she seemed to have no real idea what I was doing. I'm really confused as to what I can do here, since on the one hand we still had fun today, but she clearly still sees me as her brother (not bothering to even follow-up on any previous vein attempt to try to improve on our relationship through this divide). \n\nI think the most important question from all of this is if should bring this up to her or not.",

And Congress is currently working on a bill that would end trans healthcare for EVERYONE.  I know they have the votes so it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when.  Having said that, how quickly can this be enacted?  Is it signed and now you don\u2019t have healthcare or will this only be effective 1/1/26 kind of deal?  I\u2019m worried bc I have BA scheduled and approved for March then SRS for Nov 25.  Are those now in jeopardy?  ",

    "selftext": "Not a damn thing. \n\nThere is so much weight placed on being a pretty passing young thing that so much life is lost just accepting, living as a normal, everyday looking kind of woman out in the world. As someone who has always loved and appreciated their friendships with girls, with women, who has had plenty of close and intimate relationships with women of all ages, as a worker who has chosen a field that has kept me in close proximity to women, who has served women in a front line kind of way throughout most of my working life, I know that there are precious few of us that would truthfully be considered world class beauties, no matter how we look at it or how we think about ourselves. It is what it is, and no amount of imagining will change that. The Bell Curve places most of us right in the middle of things. Not beautiful, not ugly, just who we are. Normal, everyday kinds of women.\n\nI know how women look at the crack of dawn, at the end of the day and know, from being there right alongside them, day in and day out, that most do their best to keep it pulled together, and some do it all the time, knowing that time, age, and societal expectations do a number on us all and know that there is not a damn thing we can do about it but throw money at it to try to slow it down. Most of us know that how we've lived our lives has colored our looks. Most of us know that we are never going to be Tik Tok stars, be well paid influencers, be splashed on the cover of Vogue. Most women I know make due with their looks, fret about those looks and know, without a doubt, that other women are doing the same. It is a vicious world and the more we do to back away from the false expectations of what women are supposed to look like, the better. But in so many ways we can't. It's a hardcore treadmill that we can't get off of. \n\nSome of us are just ugly old women. Can't be helped, we just arrive here at the bidding of life. I am almost 67. No way I can worry about that beauty thing. No amount of make up is going to get me a partner or land me a movie deal. Really, what is the problem folks have with us ugly old women? Afraid of your future? Girls, embrace it. In the meantime, while you are waiting to be a crone like me, cultivate self love, develop a sense of style, be courageous and learn not to care what others think about how you look. Beauty is only skin deep. And ours is only as deep as the life we've lived. Love, Cat",

Let\u2019s say a state like Ohio forbidding transgender people from using the bathroom matching their identity. How would that even work? For example, if someone is MtF, has changed all their legal documents, undergone surgeries, and passes 100%, how could they realistically enforce it? Are they going to randomly check everyone\u2019s IDs or dig into people\u2019s past records just to verify their gender? And what about cisgender people who might not conform to gender norms\u2014would they get harassed too? It just seems impractical and invasive to enforce. Thoughts?\n\nThis also goes for the Nancy Mace bill. Let's assume there's a transgender politician who doesn't tell anybody that they are transgender wouldn't the bill have zero effect.",

This was news to me!\n\nImagining myself with a vagina but still as a male causes butterflies in my stomach and makes me wish I really had one.\n\nBut to keep things short, my question is: Is it normal to feel like this? Would I be considered trans? I feel alone and don't know how to even begin and feel very un-knowlesgable in this.\n\n.\n.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for all the comments and advice. I'm more knowledgeable about gender and understand that it's not about what you have physically but who you feel you are, and it's a diverse subject. I think I found a label for myself (and if it's not correct, please correct me) but demiboy seems to fit me most. I was extremely unknowledable about the lgbtq+ community.",

Hes already come out to his friends and theres been signs for a couple of months in terms of trying to grow his hair out, shaving his legs, wanting an handbag to carry around and previous christmases wanted tea sets as gifts and such.\n\nIve seen a lot of similar posts on here but the kids are older and the advice is uaually quite sound and obvious in terms of just being supportive and offer mental and medical support if wanted. I understand that suicide and mental health concerns can sky rocket if hes not supported. Im more than supportive although im quite a pragmatic old school bloke. Didnt throw up any resistance when he told me and just told him that it was ok but it was clear that he had been talking to his mother about this.\n\nHes also autistic and adhd and i dont want to start with anything medical while hes pre pubescent and its early days but any advice would be greatly appreciated as my head is spinning. \n\n\nEdit-\nWere uk based so no puberty blockers are out of the question as of 2 days ago (fantastic timing right). Theyre not sure about the medical transition yet as theyre still young and dont know what to do yet. Also yes i know ive misgendered them in my earlier bit, its a habit im going to have to break.\n",

It\u2019s not certain that this will come to pass, but if it does, what other options exist for HRT?\n\nThere are of course specialized clinics providing abortions outside of hospitals. Which such places exist that could prescribe hormones? I know Planned Parenthood used to offer HRT, do they still and will that remain a possibility? It seems to me now is a good time to think about changing doctors in advance of something like this happening. Get away from hospitals and toward specialized private practice where possible.\n\nDoes anyone have insight on this?",

    "selftext": "TW: Mentions of suicide, Transphobia, bullying, violence, mental health struggles, dysphoria\n\nI wrote a coming-out post that I'm still pretty scared to share with friends/family.\u00a0 I would love to hear any thoughts on improvements or encouragement.\n\n[https://open.substack.com/pub/violetsays/p/dear-society-fuck-you](https://open.substack.com/pub/violetsays/p/dear-society-fuck-you)\n\nIf you don't want to click the link, here is the full text:\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n# Dear Society: Fuck You.\n\nWhen I was born, you declared me\u00a0**a boy**.\n\nWhen I was six years old, you knew I was different and so you bullied me relentlessly.\n\nWhenever I expressed myself in a way you deemed non-conforming\u2014such as crossing my legs, speaking the wrong way, or wearing the wrong thing\u2014you called me a faggot or a pussy. It didn\u2019t stop at verbal abuse; it escalated to physical violence. I would come home from school with large bumps protruding from my head after having my skull slammed into the concrete walls of the hallway.\n\nNo one was there to protect me; that much was clear. It was my fault after all. I was acting in a way that deserved punishment. I needed to adapt or I would not survive. So, I became a chameleon. I acted like the exact person you thought I should be.\n\nEach decision I made was never about what I wanted. It was about making my peers happy, making my parents happy, making my teachers happy. It was about making\u00a0*you*\u00a0happy.\n\nYou laid out my whole life plan even before I was born. First, I would go to school where I would get the best grades. These grades would let me get into the best college. In college, I would get the best grades so that I could get a job at the best company. Then I would work for this company as hard as I could. I would do such a good job so that I could get promotions and raises so that I could make as much money as possible. With that financial stability I could attract a woman who would have kids with me. My kids would then have the same set of expectations placed on them as you placed on me and the process would complete anew.\n\nI was such a good fucking kid. I listened and obeyed like no-one else. I got the best grades, went to the best school, made the most money. I did everything you told me to do.\n\nI\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m not depressed. No, that is not a tear, I AM NOT CRYING. Those feelings are for the weak. I am the embodiment of success.\n\nSo, the years go by, and I get older and older. They seem to be going by so fast, each one blending with the last. Some of the people and places change, but the story remains the same. At some point it hits me that I am going to die one day. I am going to die without ever having lived. And I knew, much like when I was a little child, that no one was coming to save me. I was going to have to save myself.\n\n# Confronting Reality\n\nThese last few decades, I lived my life for you. It has brought me so much suffering. As a child, I thought nothing could be worse than your lack of acceptance of me. I thought nothing could be worse than the verbal and physical abuse. And now, fully realizing the extent of the sacrifice I made, the sacrifice of myself and everything I am, I know that I would rather die than live for one more day under your terms.\n\nYou tell me that I\u2019m mentally ill, that I have a mental health condition, that I\u2019m crazy, that I\u2019m denying reality. The entire foundation of my life thus far is built upon lies. It is built upon me pretending to be something for you. And you want to talk about denying reality?\n\nYou want me to pretend that I like wearing shorts more than wearing a skirt? You want me to pretend that I like wearing suits better than dresses? You want me to pretend that I like being dominant more than submissive? You want me to pretend that I\u2019d rather penetrate my partner than be penetrated by them? You want me to pretend like I don\u2019t want long flowing hair? You want me to pretend that I like having facial hair?\n\nWhy should I pretend this? Who is denying reality\u2014me or you?\n\n# Sex & Gender\n\nI know I was born with a penis. I know that the cells in my body have XY chromosomes. I also know that I love to sing, and sew, and cook, and show emotion, and dress and act in a way that feels good to me.\n\nYou tell us that because we were born a certain sex, we automatically have 1000 predetermined personality traits. And yes, some of the time you are right. I was born a boy and I like legos more than barbie dolls. Good job, you got that one correct. But there are so many others that you got wrong. Because you don\u2019t know me\u2014only I know who I am. I am the one living in this body. I know my needs, desires, and wants more than you could ever hope to.\n\nAll of these traits which you associate with someone\u2019s sex are called\u00a0**gender**. It\u2019s so important to distinguish between sex and gender. Sex is biological, but gender is something created by you, our society. Gender is a set of expectations that society puts on sex. These expectations shift and change over time, but they are always present.\n\nGender is like The Matrix \u2014 a completely fabricated world, but because it is all around us and we know nothing else, it appears to be immutable and real. But there is nothing real about saying \u201ca boy can\u2019t like pink\u201d or \u201ca boy can\u2019t like to wear a skirt\u201d.\n\nLike Neo, I wish I could escape The Matrix and enter a world where gender didn\u2019t exist, where I could simply like what I like without being categorized or classified. As of yet though, I am stuck here in the matrix.\n\n# Categories & Boxes\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 categorizing is useful. It helps us predict how others might behave based on limited data, which is key to survival\n\nIf I tell you that someone supports the right of every person to own a firearm, you could predict, with pretty high accuracy, that this same person would also be in favor of lowering taxes. These categorizations exist because they are useful tools for our brains to predict things about people. Sometimes the categorization is wrong \u2014 for example, there are plenty of people who support the right to own a firearm who also are interested in raising taxes to support social programs. But as long as the categorization is right\u00a0*most of the time*, it is useful to people.\n\nImagine I attend an NRA convention because I support the right to bear arms. Someone smiles at me, pats a \u2018Proud Republican\u2019 sticker on my shirt, and says, \u2018Thanks for supporting our cause.\u2019 Now, let\u2019s say I agree with Republicans on this one issue, but for 999 others, I\u2019m a Democrat.\n\nWith this \u201cProud Republican\u201d sticker stamped on me, let\u2019s analyze what happens when I interact with different people. A republican sees my sticker and invites me over to their house for dinner. At dinner, the conversation turns awkward very quickly. \u201cWhat do you mean, you support abortion?!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not a real republican! Who gave you that sticker?!!!\u201d. And any democrat who I come across will see my sticker and immediately turn away from me saying, \u201ceww, a republican!\u201d. Wearing this sticker effectively sabotages almost every interaction I have with other people.\n\nGender operates in much the same way as that sticker. I am walking around the world with a sticker that says \u201cI\u2019m a boy\u201d. Even though, if you look individually at the 1000 characteristics that categorize people into \u201cboy\u201d vs \u201cgirl\u201d, I would fall into the \u201cgirl\u201d category for the vast majority of them. Because of the incongruence between my actual internal identity and the category in which I am placed, I am perfectly positioned to fail miserably with almost every interaction I have with people. The people who think they like me realize that I\u2019m not the person they think I am. The people who look at me and immediately decide that they don\u2019t like me miss out on what could have been a very rewarding connection.\n\nThese boxes and categories\u2014created by YOU\u2014are both artificial and powerful. This is why I can\u2019t just ignore gender. This is why I can\u2019t just be \u201ca boy who wears a dress\u201d. The category matters way more than any individual interest or trait.\n\nThe next time you see someone you \u2018suspect\u2019 is transgender because one trait doesn\u2019t align with the others, just know that this person is not \u201cpretending\u201d to be a man or \u201cpretending\u201d to be a woman. This person was pretending their whole lives to be something else for you and they finally had the courage to be who they really are.\n\nDo you really think I enjoy this or that it\u2019s just for attention? I spent my entire life trying to hide. I minimized myself constantly in order to make other people more comfortable. I don\u2019t want your attention, I just want to live my life as me. \u201cLife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\u201d. That\u2019s what I want, just to be left alone to live life in the way that makes me happy. Is it really so difficult?\n\n# Difficult Topics\n\nThe conversation becomes more fraught when people perceive trans rights as infringing on the rights of other people. The biggest topics lately have been about access to gender-affirming care for adolescents, access to bathrooms, and access to sports.\n\nPeople are being told that their kids are going to get \u201ctrans\u2019d\u201d at school, come home, and want to get their genitals cut off. Fear has taken over, leaving logic, reason, and compassion behind.\n\nWhen considering these issues, reflect on my story and those of other trans people. Think about what would have helped us vs hurt us. Talk to trans people and listen to their perspectives\u2014we\u2019re rare, but we exist. You may have never met one of us before, but maybe you should before you make sweeping decisions that affect all of us.\n\nFor me, I wish I had been born in a time when people openly talked about gender in school. I wish I had figured this out much sooner. I wish I had access to puberty blockers and hormones as a kid. Undoing the effects of male puberty as an adult is an enormous challenge. It\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s painful, and the results are never as good as they could have been if I\u2019d had access to care earlier.\n\n# Waves Goodbye\n\nLike being gay, being trans is just one possible part of the human experience\u2014and it is not a choice. I would never have chosen this for myself. Yet every time I\u2019ve tried to ignore it or deny it, it has felt like standing in the ocean, trying to fight the waves.\n\nI hope the world becomes a more accepting place for us, even though it seems to grow more hostile each day. We make up just 1% of the population, yet we are demonized by mobs with pitchforks\u2014people who bear an unsettling resemblance to the bullies of my youth. We are 4x more likely to be victims of violence, and 40% of us attempt suicide. Being trans is already hard, but the relentless pressure and hostility we endure often make life unbearable.\n\nIf you had been with me in the hallways of my school all those years ago, I hope you would have stood by me against the bullies. I hope you would have seen me as worth protecting\u2014as human, and as worthy of living. I hope you can stand by me now.\n\nYou may have met me before, but you didn\u2019t really know me\u2014just a meticulously crafted mask that I created to protect myself. I am taking it off now.\n\nMy name is Violet, nice to meet you.",

Right, so to say.\n\nTo clarify, there's quite a lot of posts where (cis) people are asking about certain behaviors from their trans partners, and tbh none of it has anything to do with being trans. I can't help but wonder if they think being trans means we're different somehow, like we're all the same person just because we share one thing in common.\n\nI don't like it. I understand its not malicious behavior, but can it please stop? I'd like it if a new rule were put in place for this subreddit, where making posts about other trans people's behavior was no longer allowed (with certain exceptions ofc). Who here agrees??\n\nEDIT: I've noticed some people don't understand what I mean (SnooObjections9416). I'm trying to make posts unrelated to this subreddit against the rules. For example (nsfw); I recently saw a post where a cis person was asking why their trans partner wants a threesome. THAT'S NOT RELATED!!! Posts like that are screaming \"I think you're all the same because you're trans, and I'm not a real ally\". They're pretty much telling us they are closeted transphobes who see us as a 'type of person' by being trans.",

I find it really attractive if someone I\u2019m with has a lady dick. I think it\u2019s hot. I think it\u2019s hot when girls have strap-ons. This isn\u2019t limited to trans girls. But I am so attracted to a pretty girl with a dick. Would this be offensive to anyone or considered a fetish? I don\u2019t want to make anyone feel like I like them BECAUSE they\u2019re trans. That seems invalidating to them as an individual. I would appreciate some feedback and again, I hope this isn\u2019t an offensive question.",

I love her to bits, we met in college and have been super close ever since. She is truly someone I hope to have in my life and see flourish into the best version of herself as we grow old.\n\nNow, to the issue. \n\nOver the years we have been friends, she\u2019s made comments here and there about me speaking about my love/sex life (which we mutually discuss) where she\u2019s expressed a sense of inferiority. I am heavily sympathetic towards this, she is very outwardly masc presenting due to her family being unaccepting and deals with a lot of dysphoria due to this due to not looking how she wants in order to date. I have always been able to talk her down from these episodes and when she\u2019s made a comment I\u2019ve made sure we talked it out.\n\nRecently, though, she\u2019s been mentally through the wringer and the comments have hurt a bit more.\n\nWe were driving together earlier and I mentioned horrible pain I had been having the past few days. I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and struggle with a lot of health complications due to it. She knows this. \n\nAfter I had mentioned the pain I was in she sighed and went \u201cwell at least you have ovaries!\u201d and it made me feel like absolute shit. I told Emily how it made me feel and she kind of apologized, but I felt heavily iced out for the rest of the night. I told her when it happened that she does not want the issues I face and that I wouldn\u2019t wish them on my worst enemy, and she told me \u201cI wouldn\u2019t either\u201d and ended up glossing over the whole thing entirely.\n\nI love Emily dearly, but comments like this make me feel heavily alienated & uncomfortable. I feel like an asshole for being as upset as I am about it, but it really fucking hurt.\n\nThis combined with another comment she made in relation to me getting gross dms/harassed by men in general (in response to some complaining I did about it she said she \u201cwished she got attention\u201d basically) really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nShould I unpack why I feel upset like this, or am I justified in how I feel?

To give you an idea about how my gender is externally perceived, I think most people who know about non-binary people assume I am non-binary, and anyone else assumes I am a masc queer woman. I am occasionally assumed to be a man in passing, but not in conversation. \n\nProbably at least 20%-30% of the time I go through airport scanners, my crotch gets flagged and I have to get a pat down in the area. I know generally how these scanners work in that they pre-select a gender, but I don\u2019t understand why my crotch is flagging? If they thought I was a woman, nothing should flag because my anatomy matches. If they thought I was a man, my chest might flag as extra material, or maybe my crotch might flag because I don\u2019t have a dick, but I doubt I\u2019m being mistaken as a guy 20-30% if the time. Also, often when I\u2019m pulled aside they automatically have a woman pat me down, so they don\u2019t think I\u2019m a man. \n\nI have a few theories, but none seem to fully fit. \n\n1. The extra fabric I don\u2019t fill in my boxers sometimes flags the sensors. However, I\u2019ve recently switched to \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d boxers which don\u2019t have any extra fabric, and have still been pulled aside. Also, I wore them quite high waisted and there really wasn\u2019t much extra fabric. \n\n2. My genital piercing is flagging it. However, from my research, this is only an issue at super large gauge piercings. It does not protrude at all. Also, getting flagged predates the getting the piercing. \n\n3. Originally it was the boxers flagging it, but since I\u2019ve switched underwear and gotten a piercing, it\u2019s now the piercing flagging it. This does line up timeline wise, but I don\u2019t think either would be substantial enough to flag the sensor that often in the first place. \n\nAny ideas? It happens across different countries and cultures. It\u2019s not too much of an issue, I mainly want to find out what might be causing this as a curiosity. However, I definitely have had uncomfortable experiences getting pat down so often and have had staff say weird things about my gender. Thanks! ",

    "selftext": "I just want to be very clear about this before you read this shitstorm of a post. I've never used reddit and that i am very bad at the \"LGBTQ- lingo\"... Sorry in advance.\n\nMy best friend came out as trans...\n\nOk, i just really need to write this out because i've just been hit with a bombshell and my teeny tiny straight brain can't comprehend the news that i just heard. Feel free to comment and give advice. I just need to write my feelings on this topic. (There are going to be spelling mistakes, English is my second language.) FYI Before you read. I'm fully aware that i am a stupid uncultured and ignorant asshole... But i really want to help my friend...\n\nMy friend who i've known now since i was 16 (now 24) just recently had a lot to drink when we played video games this last night. In his drunken stupor he talked a lot of his mental health and how he struggles alot with it to me and his other friend on a voice call (Depression and self harm were the big topics)\n\nWe play and hang out as much as we can when we're not working opposing shifts. As you do. We are best friends after all!\n\nAbout a year ago we were sitting on his couch having some beers and got totally shitfaced, laughing and telling jokes...but as it so often happens he started to tell me about his feelings, he starts opening up to me about his insecurites and such. I, as the good friend that i try to be listens to him of course. And he tells me he is Bisexual.\n\nHe tells me that he doesn't see gender as a defining factor of why he likes someone as a romantic partner. He was troubled by having to be drunk to tell me this but i reasured him that i was fine with it. \"Whatever floats your boat\" i said.\n\nBut i feel like an asshole... Because i became uncomfortable with these news. I didn't know what to think. Of course i knew that he wasn't hitting on ME and was going to confess his love or something. I know that much. But it kind of... Rubbed of on me in a uncomfortable way. I don't know how to describe it.\n\n A couple days pass and we don't really talk about it. Things move on, i unintentually or intentually, forget about it.\n\nFast forward to this past night. We were having a great time playing some video games and my friend starts drinking a bit more than just a few beers... \"Hell yeah bro, get wasted, its a saturday night who cares\"... or something like that i said...\n\nHe starts making jokes about wearing thigh highs and a skirt, which in hind sight he has made before... I've just not thought about it. I laugh it off and we continue playing.\n\nLater when we've finished playing we just start talking on the call with no game to play in the meantime and his other friend joins. We laugh and talk about work and make jokes as good friends do. But the tone suddenly changes after some time. The jokes my friend makes are getting a bit too self depricating. We try to figure out how he is doing and he goes on a tangent that has me stunned. \n\nHe has been doing the forbidden self harm on his arms and legs and we try to get him to open up about why he has been doing it. Me being a stupid idiot gets mad and tells him of, trying to make him \"get a grip\" and speak up. I suggest talking to a therapist and such.\nHe then realizes that he maybe has said to much being drunk but luckily doesn't shut down the conversation as he has done before...\n\nWe talk some more about why he has been feeling sad and it comes down to a bombshell that hit me so hard in the face that i just sat there... stunned... Didn't really know how to feel.\n\nMy best friend for about 10 years tells me that he is living in the wrong body, being uncomfortable with how he looks and feels being a guy. is sitting on a voice call in a girl outfit and tells me he is wanting to become transgender, Male to female.\n\nMe being a straight guy that has never had any gay experiences or have had any real knowledge of the LGBTQ+ community is feeling... Vexed, confused. These things only happen on TV or in the big cities i thought.\n\nI am completly the WRONG guy i thought to be on my best friends side and telling him that i fully support him. But then again, who else is going to? \n\nI talk with him and his friend about this topic and i tell them that i don't understand, and that i probably never will. But i will support him, always. As this conversation dragged on for a long while it ended a bit abrupt. We said our goodbyes as i needed to go to bed.\n\nAlas i am laying here on my bed writing this shitty post. I realize that all this time my friend has been totally shitfaced and is probably not going to remember alot of what we have been talking about. He is most definetly going to wake up tomorrow feeling hung over and regreting all that he has said. \n\nAll i know is that i want him to feel better, he got stupidly happy when i said that i support him and that i will be by his side.\n\nHe said that he has been scared about coming out with this information to me as i am not a person who has been vocal about LGBTQ rights.\n\nI know i am just word vomiting but this was something i think i needed to write down. \n\nWhat i am going to do is try to make my friend talk to a professional, like a therapist., I do think it is a VERY hard thing to do for him. Probably the most hard thing that he is ever going to do. But i think that will help him alot. There are of course other things in his life that he needs to talk about. Not just about the trans thing. \n\nI might be a dumbass who doesn't know anything about this topic but i just want my friend to not be sad anymore and not become another victim beacuse nobody would listen to him.\n\nAgain, if you are reading this i am so sorry if my incompitance has made your eyes burn. This is one of the first times i \"vent\" online and write a post for that matter since i can't really talk to anyone about this. Hope you have a wonderful day!\n\n-D",

    "selftext": "Last hour of Xmas, my parents randomly launched into a TERF tirade. I'm completely at sea as they are both old hippies with majority LGBTQ (or rather LGBQ) friends and have been staunch allies for decades. I believe they have been politicised but I don't really understand how. \n\nThey have done what they called a 'deep, deep dive' and have a few main talking points, which I'd like to counter next time I see them.\n\n1. Puberty blockers and pre-adult transitioning. They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions. I kind of agree but can see the point of puberty blockers, although I have zero scientific understanding of why they are necessary and what the pros and cons are (specifically medical ramifications).\n\n2. Trans women in cis female spaces (the classic bathroom/changing room debate). They insist this poses dangers to cis women. I pointed out that the same arguments were probably being made around gay men in cis male spaces and that threw them a bit. But they also said that a predatory male could just declare themselves a woman and enter freely. Looking for any stats / studies that may have looked at this, as it seems very unlikely. I also pointed out that trans women would face much higher dangers in cis male spaces, but they simply said 'there are more cis women'. Would also like some examples of trans women experiencing violence in cis male spaces.\n\n3. Medical dangers of transitioning. Specifically some shit about bones crumbling. Scientific articles I have found dispute this, no idea where that came from. Other dangers positioned as 'well we just don't know what the bad effects could be'. Looking for long-term studies on physiological effects - most of the ones I found were looking at psychological.\n\n4. Peer pressure / mis-identifying dissatisfaction. Saying a lot of youth are simply buying into the hype and misplacing typical angst with gender dysphoria. Randomly threw out an example of 12 students from the same class all wanting to transition. Is this happening? Any evidence? I can believe a bit is happening but I can't imagine it's that widespread.\n\n5. Regret. This was framed through the lens of still being unhappy. I made the point that trans people aren't widely accepted in society so how can they know that the unhappiness isn't from not being accepted as the gender they identify as.\n\n6. Radical feminism. My mom specifically thinks being trans exclusionary is being feminist, because 'trans women aren't women'. Looking for literature that examines trans women in feminism. \n\n7. A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma. My mom's friend has a trans son and is clearly struggling with it, apparently called it a 'daily trauma'. I can't help but not give a fuck about that 'trauma', but any literature on this matter might help.\n\nThey are both rational and mostly accepting so I believe they can be swayed. They were quite shook that I had heard almost identical arguments from homophobes about gay people, so even a book or article comparing the two movements and their struggles might help. \n\nI should mention that my wife and I are both cis and don't know any trans people directly, so while we consider ourselves allies, we don't know much about the trans experience at all. We both want to use this as an opportunity to learn, as well as gather data we can use to counter bigotry. That being said, I am mainly looking for scientific or at least non-fiction books / articles / studies. If you would like to recommend a book that focuses on trans experience, I'd love to read it, but please label it as such so I know.\n\nThank you SO much to everyone who responds. I know the onus isn't on you to educate the community and appreciate you taking the time to help me guide my parents towards non-bigoted views, while educating my wife and I on the realities of the trans experience!\n",

I remained that way until i was 15 and 1) realized i was being groomed and 2) realized that trans women are actually oppressed and when i brought that up to my terf mutuals, i was bullied out of the community. I was then just so fed up  with them bc it was just an echochamber cult. i asked some questions on trans subs what being trans actually means. And i realized my entire ideology was based on misunderstandings and hate. I believed being trans was about gender roles. I thought ppl were trans because they liked things associated with the other sex. but when i actually asked trans ppl, i learnt it's pretty much about your self perception and who you really are on the inside. \nIt's been like 6 months, I'm 16 now, and I've watched a lot of videos and read a lot about trans experiences and I'm understanding it all better. \n\nThere are some things that give me the ick though and idk how to address it. It's just the whole egg_irl memes about questioning if they're women bc they wanna be a lesbian weirds me out so much. And the weird infantilizing way women on r/mtf talk about being a girl. I dont get it. I find it weird. Am i transphobic if I find the whole \"good girl\", \"uwu i wanna be a catgirl\" \"i wanna be a lesbian still cis tho :3\"  thing just infantilizing and weird????",

It's been amazing so far, we have so much in common, and I genuinely feel great when I'm around her.\n\nFor the first couple of dates, the fact that she's trans didn\u2019t come up. I obviously didn\u2019t bring it up, and she didn\u2019t mention it either, which I totally respected.\n\nThe other day, she shared that she\u2019d felt a bit stressed during those earlier dates\u2014before she had come out as trans to me \u2014 wondering if I \"knew\". In an attempt to reassure her, I clumsily was like, \u201cOh, no worries, hun, I had figured it out, and I really didn't care!\u201d\n\nLooking back, I realize that probably wasn\u2019t the most affirming thing to say. I feel bad because I might have unintentionally rubbed the fact that she doesn\u2019t pass in her face, which was never my intention. She definitely did not seem pleased with my response.\n\nI really want to make sure I respect her identity as an important part of who she is and her story, while also not making it a big deal that it feels alienating or like I\u2019m fixating on it (I myself don't love it when people keep bringing up my sexual orientation, like who cares, it's the least interesting thing abt me forreal). I care about her so much and want to strike the right balance between being supportive and keeping things natural. \n\nWhat would have been a better, more supportive way to respond to her sharing that? Should I bring it up again and apologize, or is it better to move forward without reopening the conversation?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

    "selftext": "I think my roommate is trans\n\nA little backstory before I get into it: I\u2019m a 20 year old guy, and so is my roommate. We became friends recently, we\u2019re both college students, sharing a dorm at a fairly liberal college, it\u2019s in my home state. He grew up in a conservative Christian family and moved across the country to be here. He told me early on that it felt strange at first because it was so different from what he was used to. The first few weeks we were roommates sucked. He came off as a bit of a dick, he made some questionable comments, didn\u2019t clean up after himself and he always did homework at like midnight with the light on. We have fixed these problems now. But one day, he vented to me about how one of the required classes for his major was doing a bit on LGBTQ history, and he wasn\u2019t happy about it. I don\u2019t know if it was how I look or how I play a lot of \u2018masculine games\u2019 and shit or whatever but he apparently thought I was on board. So I took the chance to tell him I was trans, and he was fairly shocked, which I can tell you felt pretty good because he told me he couldn\u2019t tell. Anyways it was pretty awkward after that for a while but a week or two later he saw me playing a game he liked and I guess that was enough for him to get over it because he watched me play for a while and then he apologized to be for complaining about the assignment and he told me that he hadn\u2019t met anyone trans or anyone gay, and he said I was nothing like he had been taught. And long story short we\u2019re friends now. \nNow to the actual story: After finals, I decided to take my roommate to see I Saw the TV Glow as a little treat. It was playing in a small indie theater in town, and I\u2019d heard about it from a friend who saw it when it first came out. They told me it was about a trans girl, so I thought it might be an interesting watch, and maybe even good for my roommate to see. What my friend didn\u2019t tell me was how absolutely devastating the movie is. It's a pretty hard watch, not because it's bad but how visceral everything is. Safe to say the car ride back to our dorm was absolutely silent and we both cried a bit.\nBut in the weeks since we saw it he hasn\u2019t really bounced back to his usual self. He\u2019s been sticking around campus over winter break since it\u2019s too expensive for him to fly back home, and I invited him to a family gathering because I didn\u2019t want him to spend the holidays completely alone. He seemed okay there, but after that, he slipped back into being unusually sullen and withdrawn.  \nA day or so after we saw the movie, I had asked him what was wrong. He only said, \u201cIt was a pretty intense movie.\u201d which is true, but since he still wasn\u2019t back to normal a week later I began to feel like there was more to it than that. Now, I don\u2019t want to overanalyze this, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that watching it might\u2019ve made him realize something about himself.  \nThere have been a few moments that make me wonder if he\u2019s grappling with his identity. For one, I remember him getting visibly uncomfortable when someone casually asked him what he identified as. At first, I chalked it up to his conservative upbringing. But now, I\u2019m not so sure. He also always chooses female characters in video games, which I think some people do to like see tits or whatever but he\u2019s not really like that. I remember finding him painting his nails one time, which I really don\u2019t care about, but I could tell he did because he started laughing about how stupid it was, he has also gotten almost frozen when we met a trans woman at a party, like he was impressed out at how good she looked but shocked that she was trans, and again I thought it was because his family is weird, but I have come to a different conclusion now. \nMaybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but if there\u2019s even a chance he\u2019s questioning or coming to terms with something, I want to be there for him. If anyone could offer some advice at all that would be great. I also posted this in r/trans and it got removed for some reason, but to be clear I am also trans.",

Better scroll the comments until I find someone being transphobic. \n\nI had it happen to me yesterday in real life, which is what prompted this post. I was at the thrift store and a book about feminism caught my eye, when I saw it was from the 80s I thought \"there's probably some really fucked up shit about trans people in there\" and started looking through the table of contents. Sure enough there was one chapter about it, I started skimming it and ruined my whole day. After I put the book back I just kept thinking \"why the fuck did I just do that?\" I'm very familiar with that era of feminist literature, and I knew what I would find and that it wouldn't make me feel good, but I did it anyway. Is this just a form of self harm?\n\nP.S. To add some levity to this post, on the same shelf just a few books over from the feminist one, there was just a straight up hardcore gay furry porn novel. Every page I flipped to had some wild shit, and I was cackling in the Goodwill when I found it. NSFW: https://imgur.com/a/dMKcwYS",

My son is 16, he identifies as Male , however he want to appear female (specifically, wider hips, smaller waist,softer skin, softer appearance I. General ) he does Not want breast. What he does want is; no facial hair and less wider jaw and chest.\n\nMy question is what are his options?  I looked into puberty blockers but they seem expensive and stop erections which might not be what he wants(he is in a serious relationship)\n\nEstrogen from what I understand grows breast which can be permanent (which he does not want)\n\nAnother concern for either is the mood changes! He is already struggling with mental health, adding to it might not be the smartest idea. \n\nDoes insurance cover this type of stuff? (We have state assistance insurance btw)\n\nplease any advise, if you been through/or are in a similar situation, and your experience and advice on the topic anything helps ty!!!\n",

I'm 23 (MTF \"4 Months HRT: 1 Month Of Injections\"). I just took my estradiol injection this morning and decided to do it in my thigh but a lot deeper into the fat as I had gotten a decent bit thicker since last week. The injection hurt a bit more than usual but that doesn't matter-\n\nSo... I have a boyfriend (20) and he is VERY flirtatious and more often than not... down bad sexual with me. We do calls and texts because we live a state apart currently and I was doing a video call with him a little bit ago. Things were going fine and all was well until he took his shirt off-\n\nI'm not usually a super down bad horny girl, but for some reason... This time it hit different, like 1,000,000% different- I started explaining to him why he's my type and my voice was starting to flood itself with lust, which happens sometimes but not often...\n\nNormally I calm down after this fairly easily but this time instead of calming down, I just got even more aroused- The details of my description of why I find him so attractive kept getting more and more graphic and my voice was instinctually getting higher and more lustful by the second...\n\nI just kept getting more and more down bad until my face starting tingling, which turned to a seriously intense sensation only comparable to your leg going numb after sitting on it for too long. Only difference is this didn't hurt, but rather felt extremely euphoric and blissful-\n\nShortly after my face went numb, my thoughts faded and I was trailing off into a mumbling, drooling state...\n\nThen, it happened... My entire body lost all it's strength, and that same tingle in my face, rapidly rushed to my privates, especially my breasts... It was like an intense yet painless burning warmth that started in my crotch and chest and then shot all over my body followed by paralysis and bodily twitches.\n\nI couldn't talk, move, or even reposition my eyes- In fact, my eyes were rolled into the back of my head  as all I could do is lay there, trembling with drool running down my cheek and a relentless feeling of euphoria.\n\nThis lasted for roughly 2 minutes before it slowly faded and I sat up with a long lost feeling of pure relaxation and immense confusion.\n\nCan somebody PLEASE explain... WHAT THE F U C K THAT WAS-",

If you want to add your opinion, feel free to. I decided that, even though I don't truly understand why it's appropriation rather than appreciation, since it's not my call whether it is a bad thing or not, I'll listen to y'all. I'm going to change it to the equivalent of it existing in my country. I'm sorry if I came off as racist or anything of the sort, I didn't mean to, thank you for giving me your advice.\n\nEdit 3: another clarification, since this seems to be getting misunderstood. I chose this name from an anime because the character I resonated with happened to be from it. If it were from any other form of media and resonated the way it did, I would've felt the same and probably chose that, the fact that it's a character from an anime is purely just random chance.\n\nSo, as the title says, I'm transmasc and I'm white. I'm 18 and have been going with this name since I was 13. It is a Japanese name, taken from an anime character that I resonated deeply with.\n\nI am very honest and upfront when asked why I chose the name I did.\n\nRecently enough, however, I saw on Twitter a whole discourse blown by a white trans girl using a Japanese name, and, after using it for about 5 years with no issue, I started questioning whether my choice was okay or not, as well as started feeling guilty.\n\nSo, I want to ask the non-white people here, especially the japanese, if this is racist/cultural appropriation? If so, I'd also like some advice on how to go about re-transitioning socially after choosing another name, please.",

Sure lgbt have been hated for thousands of years I feel but at the same time why does it feel like it's been at the highest it's ever been. You have transphobic people who claim by doing stuff to trans people they are pleasing god who they are christant of course. \n\nI am tired of hearing all the transphobic people who say horrible things like do they not get what being transgender is. I feel the issue with society is we can never progress because thier is always a side that refuses to progress. Such as the world is becoming more and more accepting of lgbt people as lgbt grows so does the hate that is associated with it. \n\nI talked to one of my German trans friend once who told me thiers been a a raise of the nazi party again in thier Country. \n\nI feel that transphobia will never go away for the same racism will never go away. And from what I understand is that transphobic people most of the time don't even know what they are hating. They are just told to hate it and the reason it continue is because it's passed down. And no one breaks the cycle and or stops it hence it's allowed to go generation to generation. \n\nAre trans people just something people need to pin thier anger and frustration on? \n",

He's very sweet and fun to talk with, but I'm really starting to worry about the physical attraction/sexual side of our relationship. It's important to note that he knew me pre-transition before we dated.\n\nI knew that he was attracted to trans women before we dated, but I fear it's in a way that doesn't sit right with me. The first thing that worried me is when he told me he's really into \"sissy\" porn with feminine men, and it's the majority of what he watches. Not really porn with trans women, but more skewed to cross-dressing men and people who are feminine, but still definitely men.\n\nHe hasn't explicitly said it, but also through numerous talks and interactions since we've started dating, he's shown pretty clearly that his type is really clocky trans women, as well as feminine men. Learning this made me sick to my stomach, I thought I generally passed pretty well and all that, but the sheer interest he's expressed in people that are his \"type\", and saying how much im his type, has been making me doubt my self-image a lot. From his interactions with me as well as my other MTF friends, I'm starting to feel like he views trans women as some sort of \"femboy+\". \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is his obsession with seeming more sexually experienced to his friends? They have a document where they track how \"pure\" everyone is, based on things that they have done, a lot of which are sexual. Before we'd ever gotten sexual, it often felt like his desire to have sex with me stemmed less from desiring me, and more from his desire to check boxes on that stupid purity test. He brought it up in at least 50% of our sexual conversations, and it just added to the feeling that I'm some sexual object to him, both to please his fetish and to obtain bragging rights amongst his friends. To tack onto this, after our first time, his interest seemed to decrease a bit which further lead me to believe that a chunk of his interest was based on bragging rights. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that his interest in \"sissy\" porn could definitely stem from a desire to take on a more feminine role, but I don't know how comfortable I am with that. He's expressed interest in bottoming before but I told him very very explicitly at the start of our relationship that I will never ever dom him in any way because it makes me feel awful.\n\nIs this an overreaction? Am I jumping to too many conclusions with this? Are we even compatible? I can't tell if I'm just in my own head about it, or if it's actually weird behavior.",

You have all been very helpful and I appreciate it. \nI have decided that it\u2019s best that I ask her before correcting any customers who misgender her to ensure that she feels comfortable with me doing so.\n\n\nMy coworker, who is a trans woman, gets misgendered regularly by customers. Customers will often come up to me and refer to my coworker as \u201che\u201d or \u201cthat chap over there\u201d and it\u2019s starting to wind me up. I feel like I should correct them and I will often state her name hoping they\u2019ll get the hint and realise their mistake but they never do.\n\nI don\u2019t want to burden my coworker with this issue or even bring it to her attention because I don\u2019t want her to feel uncomfortable or be hurt by this so I thought I should bring this to reddit. \n\nShe presents as female, wears makeup, has a feminine haircut etc. so I feel like they shouldn\u2019t be getting her gender wrong all the time. So, should I start (politely) correcting customers or should I continue to hold my tongue?\n",

There\u2019s also a description where she \u201cwalks like a woman but talks like a man\u201d. The narrator also has a bit of a crisis at realising she is trans, before it is ultimately resolved with his acceptance of Lola.\n\nHow do you personally feel about the song \u201cLola\u201d?",

    "selftext": "4 years ago I realized that I'm not comfortable in the body in which I was born and started to make various feminine changes: female perfume, remove hair on the whole body, female manicure, dress unisex.\n\nAfter a while I realized that I was non-binary and presented myself with a gender neutral name, then I started to realize that I wanted to be more feminine, that I might be a trans woman, changed my voice through training, changed my pronouns to \u201cshe\u201d, started HRT, I had a lot of external changes to feminize my body, but my breasts grew small (as I wanted) and after a year I had a bottom vaginoplasty surgery and planned to change my gender and name to feminine in my documents.\n\nAfter 3 months post SRS surgery I recovered and realized I no longer wanted a woman's manicure, I wanted to wear more unisex clothes and I didn't want a complete social transition to woman. I probably won't even change my ID to female and socially I prefer to remain non-binary and I will probably keep my male ID and name. Plus I realize it's easier for me to be socially more muscular or non-binary than to be a woman. Now I can use any pronouns and any name for myself, but I love my new body and don't want to stop feminine HRT.\n\nIt turns out I'm making a mini-transition from trans woman to non-binary because after vaginoplasty my body dysphoria is completely gone, I'm happy to be in my body, but I don't want to make a complete social transition, I like that I can dress however I want, use my male voice and not have to change my gender on my name documents.\n\nThis unexpected change happened after a vaginoplasty with a trans woman who thought she was going to do a full transition, now I'm not sure about it and it's even weird, but I'm comfortable with it.\n\nThere is a difficulty in how I will be perceived in society and whether I should change my documents to female for easier access to swimming pools or doctors because I live in a transphobic country with bad laws.\n\nIt's like being a masculine lesbian or butch. It's very interesting... It's partly like FTM because I have male documents.  \nAnyone out there with a similar experience after SRS surgery?",

    "selftext": "Recently, someone posted on a subreddit about how they don't think children should be able to get gender-affirming surgery. I am a cis man, but I have always thought banning gender affirming surgery for minors is wrong because of how harmful that could be to some people (though it's very few and far between when minors do get gender affirming surgeries). Do I think there should be a process and steps to take before arriving at that kind of a decision? Of course. But should any and all gender affirming care be banned? Absolutely not, that will always be extremely harmful no matter how many detransitioners there are. People often try to use detransitioners as an argument against gender affirming care, which is a problem in and of itself but that's another topic. I wanted to share my thoughts on such things and see if you all can add to my current view or if a change in my view is warranted and in what way:\n\nPeople in those comments are citing the potential harms of puberty blockers, hormone replacement, and the surgery.\n\nLet's look at another medical example: your child gets an infection in the arm which has a 20% chance of becoming septic and killing them if we do not amputate their arm. This will forever change their life, so you need to make a decision as their parent, with the doctor's guidance. If you choose to amputate because you don't want to risk them losing their life, would you like it if people called you a \"child abuser\" or \"child mutilator\"? If you chose to leave it up to fate and you didn't amputate, and then your child becomes septic and they either 1) Die, or 2) Barely survive and now they have severe medical problems for the rest of their life and they're severely mentally impaired.. you would wish that you had amputated their arm, and you'd never forgive yourself as that child's parent.\n\nAll this to say, in literally ANY medical decision a parent is forced to make for their child, you have to weigh the pros and the cons. The risks and the benefits. If the risks outweigh the benefits, then you should probably not perform the surgery. If the benefits outweigh the risks, however, and you think the chances of your child dying if you \\*don't\\* perform the surgery are high enough, then any parent worth their weight in salt would choose to perform the surgery. Obviously, that child will be affected negatively for the rest of their life--they literally don't have an arm because of you. But the alternative may have been much worse. And my question is, what percent chance of death would the child need to have for you to agree with the parent's decision to amputate? Is a 10% chance high enough? Or what about a 50% chance of death? When is it considered \"child abuse and mutilation\" to amputate versus \"necessary to save the child's life/health\"?\n\nAnd why should YOU--someone who is not this child's parent, someone who has no idea what situation the child is in, no idea what the parents have already tried and how hard they've worked to try and stop the infection from spreading without resorting to amputation, you, who has no medical expertise whatsoever, who is not a doctor, who is not a health professional\u2014why should you have the authority to say \"no, that's child mutilation, and should always be banned, in every single case, because that child isn't old enough to consent to having their arm chopped off.\"? Why should you have that kind of jurisdiction? Why should lawmakers have that kind of jurisdiction? Waving a wand and banning all amputations for children is so harmful and deadly, but these lawmakers are \"doing it for the children\"?? When they don't even know what these children's individual situations are?? When these lawmakers have no medical expertise whatsoever, and they're not the parents of these children?? They're not doing it \"for the sake of the children,\" they're doing it to give THEMSELVES peace of mind! If they allow these surgeries to take place, then they feel morally responsible for them. But if they ban the surgeries, then all the child death and suffering that occurs as a result of that are just a \"secondary effect\" of the ban, and \"not the intended result\", so these lawmakers don't have to feel morally responsible for the harm that their ban has caused to children (and parents and doctors). They can have plausible deniability now because, in their minds, they banned something that would cause harm. So even if more children are suffering, and even if more children die due to their ban on gender affirming care, that doesn't matter to them because \"well, that's not the intended result\". \n\nIn my opinion, your intent does not excuse your impact. You don't get to weaponize your ignorance and lack of medical expertise against a vulnerable population of people just to make yourSELF feel better. That's very callous and self-righteous.\n\nIf my child has been on puberty blockers, hormones, and therapy for years and years now, and their genitalia is the one thing that is causing them severe dysphoria to the point where I've had to resuscitate my own child 6 times now due to their 6 suicide attempts, how much longer should I wait as a parent? How many suicide attempts should it take before I finally say \"this is the only thing we haven't tried, and I'm desperate to save my child's life\"? Or should I just watch as my child continues to commit suicide over the years until one day they finally succeed? At least then I can say to myself, \"well, I did the right thing because at least I didn't mutilate their genitalia,\" right? My child is now dead, but AT LEAST I didn't mutilate their genitalia. They would thank me, if they were still alive today. And all the transphobic bigots of the world thank me for my decision too, so I should feel content, right?\n\nI think trans people's very existence in this world has been politicized by us cisgender people to where they've been dehumanized so much that cis people can't even see how such discussions (on whether or not parents should be able to make informed medical decisions with their doctors to save their children\u2019s lives/health/wellbeing) continue to harm trans people and their families. I personally hate having to talk about this to bigots who are so ignorant on the topic yet somehow feel they have the right to make these medical decisions on behalf of trans people (even adults). \n\nAnd I hate having to paint such an extreme scenario with a child who has attempted suicide 6 times just to make them understand the severity of what they're advocating for when they advocate to ban something so universally and absolutely. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. I hope I didn't upset anyone with how I talked so bluntly about this issue. ",

The other day, he jokingly said i can fuck him any day, but then followed it up with \u201cWait no it would have to be the other way around thinking about it.\u201d I said it wouldn\u2019t have to, but chickened out and refused to elaborate when he asked what i meant. I don\u2019t know what position he prefers in the bedroom (we\u2019re both pretty young so he could still be a virgin too), but i\u2019m worried me wanting to top will scare him off. I\u2019m still a virgin but i really can\u2019t stand the thought of bottoming, it\u2019s just too dysphoric i guess. Besides, i can barely stand to see my naked body in the mirror, i can\u2019t imagine trusting someone enough for them to see it. I wasn\u2019t really planning on having sex till i\u2019ve had surgery, but the waiting lists in the UK are so fucking long that it feels like it\u2019s gonna take forever. Anyways, i really don\u2019t know what to do. Do i just wait till it comes up in conversation, or do i tell him soon so he doesn\u2019t get his hopes up or anything? He\u2019s a sweet guy and i doubt a lack of sex would put him off, but i still worry.",

It\u2019s devastating to see such a vital part of gender-affirming care for young people being dismissed, despite decades of research showing their safety and importance.\n\nTo help counter the misinformation, our team has collated a range of research and resources that provide evidence supporting the use of puberty blockers. You can find it all here: https://linktr.ee/prideinhealth \n\nHopefully, this can help those wanting to learn more, advocate for change, or share information with others. If you have any additional research or resources, feel free to share them in the comments.\n\nSending support t everyone navigating this difficult time\ud83d\udc9c",

I feel like the more I think about it the more I fall in love with the idea but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t be trans, I can\u2019t be a girl, I have to stay a man. I respect all my trans folks but holy shit I can\u2019t. I just need these thoughts to end. I don\u2019t want this, I didn\u2019t choose this. This is life altering shit that I don\u2019t want. Especially since the election shits just getting worse and worse than before and that was bad already. It\u2019s just not worth it. There gotta be a way to get rid of these thoughts that\u2019s not conforming to them and allowing my self to try and be fem. I\u2019m cis not trans. I\u2019m probably just delusion since I\u2019ve had no real friends in so long. I just want a community I need this gone. I know when I was younger I use to love watching mtf transformation comics and videos and even tried a fake website to turn into a girl when I was younger but I can\u2019t do it. I have to be cis. Please help me, I\u2019m tired of being me, tired of being a failure of a person and now son. My family would disown me and abandon me. I can\u2019t lose those I care about. Help me.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not gonna try to explore anything. The more I explore the less I wanna know about myself. I\u2019m don\u2019t wanna know if I am or not trans. There gotta be a way to avoid it all together.\n\nWhy does a part of my want to be trans and then other not? It\u2019s confusing. I just can\u2019t wrap my head around it.\n\nEdit 2: Sorry I have more questions but when I\u2019m told I\u2019m not trans or it\u2019s something else I get saddened or disappointed for some reason like a longing to fit into that criteria. Is that bad or good?",

I\u2019m kinda screwed over by being very masculine so hrt will only be so effective, and I\u2019m starting to get old enough where it will be less efficient. I really doubt I\u2019ll ever get to fully be the girl my brain needs me to be. Maybe I can be half of her. Anyway, it all just feels so pointless. I\u2019m not even really living my own life. I can barely try in college because I\u2019m too sad in the present and the future feels so hopeless. Really all I get to do everyday is feel miserable that I\u2019m not a girl. What even is there for me if my past is ruined, my present is miserable, and my future will probably never work out well enough?",

It was also meant to push Democrats to abandon what Willis describes as \"a pattern of ignoring and sidelining the trans community\" in the face of escalating conservative attacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust hours after Willis\u2019s interview with The Independent, House and Senate negotiators revealed a bipartisan compromise spending bill that would ban military health insurance from covering transition care for children. On Wednesday, 50 House Democrats who previously denounced that provision voted in favor, and key Senate Democrats said they would reluctantly back it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, with Republicans taking control of all three branches of government and both houses of Congress in January, Willis is gearing up for a fight \u2013 and she does not believe trans people can afford to take their cues from Democrats.\u201d\n\n\"We have to be prepared to take care of ourselves, and speak for ourselves, and fight for ourselves, because there are not enough political leaders who are sticking up for us,\u201d she says.\u201d\n",

Sarah McBride, D-Del., from women\u2019s bathrooms on the House side of the Capitol, the first openly transgender member of Congress agreed to obey.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms,\u2019 she wrote on X.\n\n\u201cThe news sent a shudder through the trans community, and prompted journalist Baily Wayne Hundl of the Meteor to write, \u2018Girl, why?\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why: McBride had no choice and no allies. She knew Republicans wanted a fight and a spectacle so they could keep trans people (of which I am one) at the center of media attention after an election campaign that scapegoated and demonized us nonstop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a winning candidate uses 41% of his messaging to attack a group comprising less than 1% of the population, what is the impact on that minority?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you: they become an untouchable caste, with no allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it sounds like I\u2019m terrified, I am \u2014 as are many trans Americans and their families.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what terrifies me most doesn\u2019t just concern trans people. I\u2019ll pose my fear as a question: What percentage of the German population was Jewish at the time of Hitler\u2019s rise? The answer \u2014 0.75% \u2014 is lower than most people guess.\u201d",

This June, she was transferred to the Monroe Correctional Complex, a men\u2019s prison, after receiving an infraction, as HuffPost originally reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in state history that a transgender person has been moved from gender-affirming housing back to housing that aligns with the gender they were assigned at birth.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim\u2019s transfer came about three months after she received an infraction for having sex with another incarcerated woman. The infraction report was leaked to a right-wing magazine and picked up by larger conservative media outlets, which misgendered Kim and implied it could not have been consensual. Kim says it was.\n\n\u201cDOC policy says incarcerated transgender people placed in a gender-affirming facility may be transferred \u2018due to documented, objective safety and security concerns.\u2019\u201d\n\n",

In his interview with the magazine, he said \u2018the bathroom issue\u2019 only pertains to a small amount of people and it's tearing the country apart. He also advocated for people to go \u2018along with\u2019 the Supreme Court's rulings.\n\n\"\u2019I don't want to get into the bathroom issue. Because it's a very small number of people we're talking about, and it's ripped apart our country, so they'll have to settle whatever the law finally agrees,\u2019 Trump said after being asked about whether \u2018transgender people could use whatever bathroom they chose.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cA spokesperson for Trump said that he has plans for Day 1 in office, which range from settling the Russian and Ukrainian war to removing protections for transgender students.\n\n\"\u2019I am a big believer in the Supreme Court, and I'm going to go by their rulings, and so far, I think their rulings have been rulings that people are going along with,\u2019 Trump said, \u2018but we're talking about a very small number of people, and we're talking about it, and it gets massive coverage, and it's not a lot of people.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump said in his interview with TIME that he does agree with [Sarah] McBride, suggesting the lawmakers should be focused on more important issues.\n\n\"\u2019I do agree with that,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018On that\u2014absolutely. As I was saying, it's a small number of people.\u2019\u201d",

Here in the UK, the Labour government recently upheld a ban on puberty blockers for transgender kids under the age of eighteen, while debates about trans athletes dominated the Olympics, despite no trans person competing. Our general existence has become a political punching bag. It sucks, and as a trans person, it can be hard to keep going sometimes.\n\n\u201cBut you turn this anger into hope, and remain confident that there are more good people in this world than bad who either don\u2019t think much about transgender people living their lives (the vast majority), or do all they can to support them. We also search for purpose and representation in popular culture, which for younger audiences normally means the shows they watch, video games they play, and people they follow online. There is plenty of positive queer reinforcement to be found, but again and again, the biggest corporations on the planet have made it clear we are nothing more than a demographic to be taken advantage of.\u201d\n",

While the Supreme Court didn\u2019t say why it declined to hear the case, a lower court had ruled against the parents because, it said, they didn\u2019t have standing to sue since they didn\u2019t demonstrate the policy affected their children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe parents claim the school\u2019s policy facilitates \u2018gender identity transitions at school\u2019 and keeps the effort \u2018hidden from parents who would disagree that it is in their child\u2019s best interest.\u2019\n\n\u201cEau Claire Area School District officials counter that gender support plans are included in a student\u2019s record and are available for parents to see. The policy, school officials said, is intended \u2018to provide support to students who express concern about their gender identity.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018The issue in the Wisconsin case is less about the underlying question of parental rights, and more about what plaintiffs have to show before they\u2019re allowed to challenge government actions that may not have happened and may not ever happen,\u2019 said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilar cases have made their way to the Supreme Court before. The justices in May denied an appeal from a group of parents in suburban Washington who made the same argument. The challenge for the parents groups is being able to demonstrate that they were specifically harmed by the policy.\u201d",

In his plea agreement, Benza admitted that he lied to the FBI about the incident and alleged that numerous other deputies and sergeants helped obstruct the investigation and cover up the misconduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheriff\u2019s officials would not specify how many employees have been sidelined, but half a dozen sources in the department told The Times that eight people \u2014 including several sergeants \u2014 were relieved of duty. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBenza is due back in court Jan. 17, when he is expected to plead guilty to one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison.\u201d\n",

If the proposed regulations were left in their current state, the next administration would be able to rewrite them and advance its agenda more quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the pending Biden regulations are withdrawn, nothing prevents Trump from pursuing his own regulations on the same issues when he returns to the White House, but he would have to start from scratch in a process that can take months or even years.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the regulation on transgender students, the department said it was withdrawing the proposal because of ongoing litigation over how Title IX, the landmark law preventing sex discrimination, should handle issues of gender identity. In addition, the department said there were 150,000 public comments with a range of feedback, including suggestions for modifications that needed to be considered.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s rule on transgender sports was proposed in 2023 but was delayed multiple times. It was supposed to be a follow-up to his broader rule that extended civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ students under Title IX.\u201d",

Some in same-sex relationships are making plans to marry or adopt children. Others are moving to states that they believe will offer them more protection. Transgender people are stockpiling medications, worried that their access to gender transition care will be cut off.\n\n\u201cTrump has vowed to prohibit gender transition care for children and eliminate any federal spending on those treatments for adults. He has also promised to ask Congress to pass a bill stating that there are only two genders and that they are assigned at birth. And the incoming president wants to use Title IX protections to ensure that transgender women can\u2019t play on women\u2019s sports teams.\u201d\n\n",

Many starve themselves or develop other harmful eating behaviors to make their bodies conform to a masculine or feminine ideal. Studies estimate that 25% to more than 50% of trans people have had eating disorders, compared with 9% of the overall population.\n\n\u201cYet transition-related care is increasingly out of reach for minors struggling with gender dysphoria, the acute distress that results from a mismatch between one\u2019s sex assigned at birth and one\u2019s gender identity. Most U.S. medical associations consider transition-related care to be essential for minors struggling with gender dysphoria.\u201d\n",

That same day, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2014architect of an AI-powered claims denial system with a reported 90 percent error rate\u2014was shot, allegedly by a man driven to desperation by America\u2019s predatory and labyrinthine health care system, which causes as many as 66.5 percent of American bankruptcies.\n\n\u201cThe grim symmetry was impossible to ignore. The parallel path of these two events perfectly encapsulates the cynical sleight of hand at the heart of the American establishment\u2019s current political strategy. While millions struggle under the weight of medical debt and economic precarity, our political class has masterfully redirected public anger toward a manufactured crisis: the supposed threat of transgender Americans. By scapegoating trans people, they divert attention from the systemic failures killing and impoverishing our neighbors. This phenomenon is what sociologists call displacement, where economic anger and despair are redirected onto marginalized groups rather than the systems and structures that are actually causing the suffering. While the threats to trans people are real and growing, the threat of trans people is a nonexistent distraction, and attacking us will do nothing to address Americans\u2019 real material concerns.\u201d",

For example, the implementation of the New York Equal Rights Amendment into the state constitution, as well as state shield laws that protect those who practice gender-affirming care. \n\n\u201cAs a result, some, like Gray, expect to see an influx of LGBTQ+ people move to upstate New York.\n\n\u2018He said he\u2019s received calls and emails from those in other states, such as Oklahoma or South Dakota, where anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ+ laws have passed in recent years. Many call with hopes that moving to New York will provide protection for them.\u201d",

Nancy Mace of South Carolina targeted her by proposing to ban transgender people from U.S. Capitol restrooms that correspond to their gender identity \u2014 a ban that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., enacted.\n\n\u201cFor her part, McBride tried to defuse the situation, saying she would follow the rules. \u2018I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms,\u2019 the 34-year-old wrote in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile some activists want her to fight harder, to those who know her, the move was classic Sarah \u2014 a pragmatist with a reputation of bipartisanship, a person who values diplomacy over pugilism.\n\n\u201c\u2018There is so much joy and so much awe in having this opportunity, and I will not let anyone take that away from me,\u2019 McBride told The Associated Press. \u2018I am simply there to do the job just like anyone else.\u2019\n\n\u201cHer political home of the last four years, the Delaware Senate, is small \u2014 just 21 members \u2014 much like the state itself, not even 100 miles (155 kilometers) from north to south. That proximity creates the kind of collegiality that, while not constant, is often lacking these days in Washington.\u201d\n",

The decision, which is expected by summer, stands to impact similar laws passed in half the country. \n\n\u201cLast month, the justices at two consecutive conferences mulled whether to take up appeals from Idaho and West Virginia defending their bans on transgender girls competing on women\u2019s school sports teams. \n\n\u201cThe justices took no action and did not relist the petitions for discussion at any of their December conferences, court dockets show, effectively placing the cases in indefinite limbo. Though the court provided no explanation, that pattern typically occurs when the justices have decided to hold a petition pending the disposition of a current case.\n\n\u201cThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) did not object to the move.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth West Virginia and Idaho unsuccessfully cautioned the Supreme Court against waiting.\u201d\n\n",

    "selftext": "\u201cEarlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in what is likely to be the term\u2019s blockbuster case, United States v. Skrmetti. The case considers the constitutionality of state laws that ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors. While the case itself addresses only a law from Tennessee, 26 states have passed similar laws that will be affected by the outcome.\n\n\u201cA blanket ban on such care risks devastating effects for those youth who need it. But as the argument made clear, that is not all that is at stake. The case is also about women\u2019s rights, and a fundamental legal principle that helped to secure them: Courts should be skeptical of laws that discriminate on the basis of sex.\n\n\u201cWith the defenders of Tennessee\u2019s law challenging that bedrock principle, it is not only transgender equality, but sex equality more broadly that is in doubt. Depending on the outcome, Skrmetti could be the next Dobbs, adding another nail in the coffin to women\u2019s legal freedoms \u2014 and freedoms we all enjoy regardless of sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Tennessee law \u2014 and trans discrimination more generally \u2014 is not only about discrimination against trans people, but about ensuring that we all keep in our gender lanes. As [U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth] Prelogar explained, the law here is \u2018one that prohibits inconsistency with sex,\u2019 requiring that children born as boys and girls \u2018look and live like boys and girls.\u2019 Tennessee\u2019s argument would call into question the longstanding freedom we all enjoy to live our lives as we wish, regardless of sex.\n\n\u201cFar from being a neutral law that applies evenhandedly to males and females, the law at issue here is of a piece with a gender hierarchy that prizes masculinity while narrowly circumscribing femininity. \n\n\u201cMedical treatments that would reduce the fertility of trans boys and men threaten the idea of women being mothers first (and anything else second or not at all). A friend-of-the-court brief from leading conservative anti-abortion group, Alliance Defending Freedom, worried that, \u2018If both a boy and a girl are considering a mastectomy, only the girl gives up the ability to breastfeed her future child.\u2019  Scare tactics about girls renouncing maternity are part of anti-trans politics, with the cover of conservative critic Abigail Shrier\u2019s book, Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters, showing a young girl with a blank space where her uterus would be. \n\n\u201cThese anxieties about women rejecting motherhood are the very same ones that motivate much of the opposition to abortion \u2014 and they are grounded upon the very same sex stereotypes that the equal protection clause is meant to abolish.\u201d",

Next best time: right now.\n\n\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t already apparent, Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court arguments in a challenge to Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors makes it crystal clear.\u201d\n\n\u201c[O]nly 14 states (Massachusetts included) and the District of Columbia have laws in place shielding the ability of doctors, their patients, and patients\u2019 families to act according to their needs, wishes, and the proper standard of medical care, according to the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project. Two more states have executive orders currently in place protecting access to transgender health care.\n\n\u201cAstonishingly, according to MAP, 34 states have passed no transgender health care protection rules at all.\n\n\u201cThey have not learned one of the most crucial lessons from the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade: Beware the unintended yet foreseeable consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not just abortion access protections that were stripped from people in states that banned it after Dobbs. The health care implications were much wider, with some providers in states with laws defining life at fertilization choosing to halt in-vitro fertilization procedures for fear of liability. There is confusion about the legal status of frozen eggs and embryos. The incoming Trump administration creates uncertainty over the ongoing availability of not only medications for abortions but also that of some contraceptives. Maternity health care providers are fleeing states with abortion bans.\u201d",

Legislation passed last year protects the privacy of patients accessing gender-affirming care and shields medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas.\u201d\n\n\u201cMinnesota\u2019s relatively strong job market and economy are a draw for those seeking access to care, and the high cost of living for \u2018shield states\u2019 on the east or west coasts deters people from states with lower median incomes, Rohn said.\u201d\n\n\u201cHousing is a considerable obstacle for many transplants \u2014 the housing crisis in the Twin Cities affects everybody, but the absence of a dedicated LGBTQ+ shelter is a risk for anyone relocating without guaranteed access to housing, Charley [who requested his last name not be used] said.\u201c\n\n\u201c\u2018And you can\u2019t sleep in your car,\u2019 Charley said. \u2018I talked to a transplant last year who was talking about doing anything to get out of Texas and mentioned in February living in a car.\u2019\u201d",

The first occurred on Oct. 18 and the second on Nov. 12, both near a Chevron gas station in the 100 block of Ponce de Leon Drive in Northeast Atlanta. \n\n\u201cIn both cases, the victims \u2014 transgender women \u2014 sustained facial injuries after being punched. Officers found the victims with swollen faces and black eyes.\n\n\u201cIn the Nov. 12 assault, police responded to a report of a dispute near 160 Ponce de Leon Avenue NE. The victim reported being approached by two men near a gas station and followed to another location, where the suspects physically assaulted her. Officers noted that the victim\u2019s eye was bruised and swollen. \n\n\u201cWitnesses corroborated the account, and one of the suspects, Michael Boykin, fled the scene but was later linked to the incident.\nA security officer familiar with Boykin reported that he has a history of physically assaulting members of the transgender community in the area. Another suspect was arrested and charged with battery and criminal trespass for damaging a witness\u2019s phone during the assault.\u201d",

Virgil asked that KUOW not publish his last name because he\u2019s worried about anti-trans backlash.\n\n\u201c\u2018Safety, of course, was our first priority, but we also wanted to live somewhere that\u2019s nice to live, and I\u2019ve always just loved the Pacific Northwest,\u2019 Virgil said.\n\n\u201cBut now, just two years after they arrived, Virgil and his partner aren\u2019t sure they\u2019ll be safe here anymore either, and they\u2019re preparing to potentially leave the country.\n\n\u201cVirgil is one of many transgender people who are worried about what President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration means for them.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s campaign promises include asking Congress to make gender-affirming care of children illegal, and ending all federal funding (such as through Medicare and Medicaid) for gender-affirming care for adults. He also promised to ask Congress to declare that there are only two genders \u2014 male and female \u2014 and they are assigned at birth, and to use Title IX to ensure that transgender women cannot compete on women\u2019s sports teams.\n\n\u201cAs for same-sex marriage, some in the LGBTQ+ community are worried that, because that was a right granted by the Supreme Court, the current court, which has a conservative supermajority, could decide to rescind it. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in the case that overturned Roe v. Wade that the justices should revisit same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cAfter the November election, Seattle\u2019s LGBTQ+ Center filled with people looking for a place to process.\u201d\n\n",

Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed in 2023 \u2014 are overly broad and vague, and violated librarians\u2019, booksellers\u2019 and patrons\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cThe two parts of the law that were struck down would have established a criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison, for librarians and booksellers who distribute \u2018harmful\u2019 material to a minor. It also would have required local governments to create oversight boards to review challenged content, which often deal with themes of race and sexuality. The ruling, which will likely be challenged, comes as a growing number of GOP-controlled statehouses have considered similar laws that threaten librarians with prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawmakers that propose these bills contend they are necessary because school and public libraries contain graphic sexual material that should not be available to children. Arkansas state Sen. Dan Sullivan (R), who introduced Arkansas Act 372, said at the time that the law protects children and doesn\u2019t harm librarians unless they\u2019re doing something awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut others say bills like Sullivan\u2019s are ideologically driven censorship cloaked as concern for children, noting that as book challenges spiked to historic highs over the past two years, the majority of objections targeted books by and about LGBTQ people and people of color, including \u2018All Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u2019 by George M. Johnson and \u2018Gender Queer\u2019 by Maia Kobabe.\u201d",

    "selftext": "Okay, so this was a while back when I first started public school again, and at the time, I passed pretty well, if I still looked a bit fem due to my round face. Well, I explained to the school that I was trans and asked about being able to possibly use gender neutral bathrooms/locker rooms, or if I could just use the men's. And considering this is a school in Texas, they told me no and that I couldn't even use the gender neutral ones because those were really meant for disabled kids/teachers. I shrugged and said \"alright if that's what you want me to do\" and started school.\n\nAnyway, gym class rolls around and I am stoked, I love exercising and running around like a feral rat child so gym has basically always been recess for me. The teacher sends us off to the locker room to get our lockers for the year and change our clothes. I had to stay behind for a second so I could ask how the locker combos worked (different from my old school) but after that I ran off to the locker rooms to change. It's very important that we note that I was one of the last people to enter.\n\nI walk in, and immediately, at least 3 girls yell, \"WRONG ROOM\" and \"GET OUT\" while covering themselves. I jumped and looked around cuz I assumed a guy had followed me in here, but nope, I was the only person near the door. I turn back around and a bunch of the girls are scrambling to cover themselves, others are glaring, and one of them is even starting to walk towards me to push me out.\n\nNow I'm confused, so I ask. \"Isn't this the girls locker room?\"\n\nThe girl walking towards me to push me out, scoffs. \"Yeah, GET OUT.\" and then she starts literally shoving me towards the door.\n\nIt then dawns on me what has happened, and I'm not sure whether to be happy, embarrassed, apologetic or what. But I quickly stammer out that I'm trans but afab so the school told me to use these locker rooms. This gives the girls some pause and the girl shoving me stops. But everyone still looks very skeptical and uneasy\n\nSo I do the first thing I can think of, I take off my shirt to show that I'm wearing a binder while very panickly saying \"see, I'm not a creepy dude I swear.\" \n\nAnyway, they all look uncomfortable, end up asking a few more questions before letting me use the locker rooms in peace. I think that's the end of it and I now have a funny story to tell my friends after school. \n\nIt was, in fact, not the end. \n\nTurns out a small group of those girls, in their words, \"really uncomfortable with a man in the locker rooms, even if he doesn't have a dick and balls.\" (I'm giggling at kicking my feet at this sentiment) so they all band together and complain to administration about how they are making the locker rooms uncomfortable for everyone by putting me in there.\n\nAdministration does not back down, basically saying in fancy terms that I was born a girl so I am girl and I was going to use the girls locker rooms. The group of girls are furious on my behalf, but it gets so much worse when they learn I was using the girl's bathrooms too.\n\nTurns out, there are some girls that don't take gym but do use the bathrooms often, that are also annoyed with my presence. They join up with the girls and continue hounding administration to just let me use the other bathrooms because literally everyone is uncomfortable with my presence. Keep in mind, I have no clue that they are doing this.\n\nAnyway, one girl apparently complains to her mom about this and her mom is furious that the school is sacrificing not only my comfort, but all the girls comfort just to uphold their bigotry. She storms into the school and yells at the principal, threatening to sue.\n\nWell, that's all it took for the principal to get on the intercoms, call me down to the office, slam the gender neutral locker room/ bathroom key in my hand, and say that I was allowed to use whatever bathroom I was comfortable using.\n\nMoral of the story, even if your transphobic, if someone passes well enough, don't try to shove them in with the wrong gender, it just makes everyone uncomfortable",

    "selftext": "My Grandma has made a tradition out of personally making Christmas stockings for all of her children, grandchildren, and in-laws, each one with that person\u2019s name and birthday on them. My stocking was made just a few months after I was born, and since then she has fixed it twice.\n\nThe first time was when I was almost too young to even remember it. We spent the holiday at my uncle\u2019s house and his dog tore through my stocking trying to get the candy inside it. My grandma was able to fix it but it still has a bit of a scar and that actually ended up making my stocking much longer than any of my siblings. \n\nThe second time she fixed it was just this week. See, about 2.5 years ago I came out as transgender, and ever since then Christmas has been rough for me. Not just because it was always such a Christian centered holiday in my house, but also because my family and my stocking were no longer using the correct name. In the last year, I have been much more open about my identity with my family despite the fact that they are pretty much all conservative and Christian. Surprisingly, a lot of them have been pretty good about using the correct name. A couple of weeks ago, I asked my grandma if she would be able to change the name on my stocking, and to my surprise, she told me that she had already started doing exactly that! I\u2019m so grateful that my family is doing their best to acknowledge and accept my identity. I know it hasn\u2019t been easy for them, but it\u2019s great to see that they\u2019re making progress.

For the most part, he\u2019s okay with the transition. He looks into the challenges facing the trans community and he tries to be supportive. \n\nBut over the last couple of days, every time he has used my pronouns, or talked about me to someone else, he has misgendered me. It almost feels intentional. \n\nTo help him remember, I decided to let him know that every time he \u201caccidentally\u201d misgenders me, I\u2019m going to say the word \u201cf*ck.\u201d His Mormon brain hates that word. \nIt\u2019s a normal part of my vocabulary at this point. But I always sensor myself when I\u2019m around him out of respect. \n\nI said it three times to him tonight. It honestly felt really good. He flinches just like I do whenever he misgenders me. \n\nIt\u2019s been three years. Time for him to try a little harder I think. ",

I started getting very upset with him and told him to stop, but he got up and backhanded me across the face, the force of which slammed me into the kitchen table and hurt my back. he called me more slurs and I went upstairs and sobbed. after everyone finished eating, my mom came in and said she thinks it\u2019d be best for me if I just stopped being trans. I have just been wanting to die all week and I can\u2019t take his bullying anymore. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

A yelling match occurred for about 2ish hours they said stuff like \u201cwe didn\u2019t raise you to be this way\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ll take you down to the gay bar and see if you\u2019re really gay\u201d my dad even threatened to kill me. That\u2019s when my 2 older brothers came over and asked what was going on because my mom texted them. My parents made me come out to them on the spot, my brothers sided with me and argued with my parents saying that it\u2019s ok the was that I was but it had no effect they only got more and more angry. Finally mom just said \u201cyou can\u2019t be gay in my house\u201d and told me to\nPack my things, my brothers helped me load up my stuff and now I\u2019m staying at one of their houses I don\u2019t really what to do or go from here I have a job so at least I can provide for myself. I think I\u2019m gonna work toward getting my drivers license and see if I can find a cheap place to stay. Merry Christmas I guess. UPDATE: im back at my parents house for now they don\u2019t accept me but wanna buy me in therapy im gonna play along for now get my drivers license and save up to rent a room thank you for all of your support it\u2019s overwhelming I love you all <3",

When I got there, I buzzed the intercom and told the doorman what I was there for, to which he asked my name and for obvious reasons I gave him my deadname. He asked my name once again, visibly confused, and I told him my deadname again, then I overheard my girlfriend's voice through the intercom saying \"yeah, that's right, either one is fine\". He finally let me in and proceeded to call me by my real name, I even tripped in shock and we all laughed about it. My girlfriend told me afterwards that he asked her if she was there waiting for \"Mrs Claus there\", referring to me (remember the santa hat?), and she told him \"yeah, that's my girlfriend Mel\".\n\nSuch a silly interaction but it made my night.",

A few folks probably thought I was some NB flavor. \n\nI showed up in a full length flowing dress, corset, painted nails, makeup, and my hair styled. Oh, and NOT wearing an unpadded compression bra for once. \n\nHoly crap the amount of support I got! Lots of compliments on my dress, and a lot of those \"I am calling you gorgeous/beautiful as a way of saying I support you\". \n\nSad thing was there was a large chunk of folks that normally say hello to me at similar functions or day to day, especially the higher ups, That pretended I didn't exist. No eye contact, no saying hello, nothing.\n\nWent worlds better than expected. Hopefully it keeps being positive and I don't get any weirdness from folks when I come back Monday. \n\nI am celebrating, and still having a hard time believing I did it!",

And that I was hurting everyone around me by affirming myself as a trans woman.\n\nSo I snapped. I went in on him and spat out venom that I had been holding on to for all these years, telling him just how insecure he acted for all these years.

    "selftext": "I (genderfluid, 19) was in Sally Beauty today picking up my usual hair dye, and there was another person in the isle with me, someone who also looked to be visibly queer (not to stereotype). You know, androgynous, dyed red and green hair, punk jacket, a visible rainbow flag patch on said jacket.\n\nI complimented the hair, saying \"oh that's cool, did you do red and green for christmas?\" And the response was \"Yes! But I'm going back to brown for the holidays because my family won't like it, I can't find the semi-permanent brown though.\"\n\nI said \"aw that sucks, looks cool though!\" And one of the workers I'm familiar with came over considering I'm there like every other week and asked if we needed any help. I said \"Oh, well they're looking for semi-permanent brown dye, they already have developer.\" While gesturing to the person I met next to me.\n\nThis persons face instantly changed to one of disgust and went, \"They? My pronouns are He/It ONLY. NOT they/them.\"\n\nI genuinely froze up because for one, I hate misgendering people, but at the same time I was confused. I only used \"they\" considering we never discussed each others pronouns, I figured it was pretty common knowledge that unless discussed beforehand, \"they\" is an acceptable term to refer to a stranger as if you don't know how they identify, out of respect.\n\nI paused awkwardly because I'm not really good with confrontation and I couldn't fathom why this person looked so genuinely upset, even the worker looked uncomfortable. After a few seconds I quickly apologized with, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know, if I had known you used he/it I wouldn't have used \"they\". I only used it because I wanted to be respectful and didn't know how you identified. It wont happen again.\"\n\nI was then met with \"Yeah, well I'm NOT non-binary or whatever. I don't want to be grouped with that.\"\n\nAnd then I paused again, thinking, \"Is this person who's under the transgender umbrella simultaneously enby-phobic?\"\n\nGenuine curiosity got the better of me and I asked why he thought that way, and he said that it was because of all the \"neo-pronoun bullshit\" and \"making up terms that don't need to exist for attention, making the rest of the trans community look bad\".\n\nThen he threw in the word \"trans trender\" and I immediately knew where the conversation was going. I shook my head, grabbed my black hair dye, went to the counter and left in a flabbergasted state.\n\nUSING THE TERM \"TRANS-TRENDER\" IN 2024?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\n\nThe person looked to be around 15-16 years old so I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but damn. It felt like I was having a conversation with the reincarnate of Kalvin Garrah for a hot minute. I am now reluctant to go back to that Sally's location because I don't want to run into him again. I understand having your own opinions about the current state of the trans community but holy shit dude, there's no need to be hateful.\n\n\n",

Yesterday an article about her was released saying that she did so many heinous things in the locker room without providing any real evidence, just word of mouth, and stating it as fact.\nBased off what I know, what other people know, and my own logic, none of this makes any sense and is just a load of shit. It this shit would of actually happen I wouldn't have heard it for the first time from a fucking article. Not to mention this \"journalist\" has been accused of defamation before.\n\nThis is pissing me off so fucking hard rn.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot rule 4 was a thing, I am in fact, trans myself ",

I am mtf transfem but boymode at work because I have to use public restrooms and don\u2019t want any issues.\n\nThis was my first time at this customers house. \nShe was elderly and bed ridden.\nShe told me she has sons who live with her.\nEverything was fine I was just about finished up there and then I hear someone yelling at me.\n\n\u201cHey what\u2019s this f-slur-y ass dy-slur doing.\nFa$$&y ASS *d-slur for lesbian*. You ain\u2019t a man. You just a B@@ch in a suit.\u201d\n\nI turn around and see her paraplegic son laying in bed yelling at me.\n\n I was caught off guard and just apologized and said I\u2019m just here to help out his grandma.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a d-slur! You ain\u2019t a man. You a b*#\u20ach. Trying to make my granny gay. F-slur ass D-slur.\u201d\n\nI just gave the grandma my number said call me if you need anything and left.\n\nI was\u2026 offended? I think? I mean honestly it made me feel pretty great. He thought I was a trans man. I am not. I mean he is horrid and well\u2026 I guess\u2026 I dunno.\n\nTL;DR Paraplegic guy called me a bunch of lesbian slurs thinking I was a trans man. \n\nEdit: to make it clear he was an ass because he was an ass. I\u2019m a feminist and think all people can be assholes equally. I\u2019m just pointing out he was paraplegic because it was different from someone who could actually attack me. \nI was in control in the situation for once.\nI\u2019ve had situations when I was just starting where guys would come at me.

After him bringing up porn again and again I accused him of projecting and blocked him. Apparently he complained about being blocked so some other dude called me a man and said he bet my family all discarded me because I was a freak. I told him to die and immediately lost use of my Twitter account.\n\nGotta love it. They can say any and all shit, threaten trans people all they like, call us any name, tell us any fucked up thing they want, but I return the favor just one time.\n\nIm so mad. Im furious. I wish I could do something with this anger. Im so tired of being the bigger person. I hate these people. ",

I was put on the contraceptive pill for PCOS and horrible periods... but my body rejected the estrogen and pregesterone being pumped into my system (in a way) because something happened that wasnt supposed to happen. It was supposed to lessen or stop my periods. I ended up having a 2 week (+) long period. When i went to the doctors about it, she said that a period that long plus my normally heavy bleeding classes as a hemorrhage and i had low iron levels, so i got prescribed iron. This was about a month ago, and i was already in the process to getting T. This was just a thing to try to stop my periods and lessen the dysphoria for now. Anyway, the period stopped only a day or two after i stopped taking them. And here i am now. Tomorrow, i have another appointment with my endocrine, and as long as theres no problems (which there isn't. All of my problems are already diagnosed and confirmed by the endocrine that they raise no issues in starting T), I'll be at least getting prescribed T by tomorrow. I hope all goes well. I hate the idea of waiting until I'm 19 to start T. It's only a couple of months, but those months would be filled with dysphoria and depression for me. For now, I'm just telling myself that I'm getting T tomorrow, whether physically or prescribed at the least, haha.",

I don't really know the first one, he is a quiet guy who doesn't really mess with anyone or do anything. The problems come with the second guy. Let's call him Alan.\n\nWell I met Alan a couple years ago on another trip and I've gone on several with him. When he was younger he was kind of a brute, playing pretty rough and stuff, but he knew where to draw lines and seemed to be growing more mature but this year we went to different classes in september. When I met him again this travel he had changed. He started laughing about \"nazi good, minority bad\" \"jokes\" and expressing fascist points of view unironically and acting pretty cold with me. I knew he had been struggling with acohol and substance abuse and his parents divorce but I never expected him to go down this route. \n\nAt first I tried to be friendly. He's been through a rough patch and we've all had phases. But he didn't seem to care about that, or about the fact that I was a human being. Every time I was in the room Alan would direct comments at what he considered \"my weakness\", calling me homophobic and transphobic slurs and in the latest days even trowing objects or hitting me and playing it off as a joke.\n\nAs I hope you'll understand, I wasn't quite happy with this. Yesterday we had a clash when I threw back back one of the fruits Alan had been throwing it me, we didn't get into a fight because the quiet guy was able to take him away. Today that didn't happen.\n\nThings got even worse today than before and at one point he hit me very badly in the neck while going past me, again trying to play it off as a joke. I got really, really mad and threw a bag that was nearby at him and then Alan jumped at me. I don't really remenber anything about that exchange other than the fact that he tried to choke me (fortunately failed) but was able to open a pretty big breach on my head. Then my other roomate was able to get him off me. That was a few hours ago. Alan is getting hammered next door and I am sitting in the bed of our room waiting for this whole shitshow to be over. God I hate this so much",

This is something I never really expected to happen as I\u2019m an only child and she never really seemed interested in having more kids but here we are. My mom has always said that if she ever had a daughter she would name it a certain name. I have never came out to her because she\u2019s slightly transphobic; I don\u2019t think she\u2019d kick me out or anything if she found out but she definitely wouldn\u2019t be happy. So I figured that if maybe I made my chosen name the name she always wanted for a daughter maybe she\u2019d be less mad when I eventually came out to her...\n\nWell we found out yesterday that my mom is having a girl and she has already said that my chosen name will be her name. I can\u2019t help but be so upset by this because that was the only name I could decide on. There are many other girl names I like but I could never decide on which I liked more so I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019ll never find a name for me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do \ud83d\ude2d",

This is where I almost cried, my four year old said \" you need to be louder! , I can help you, tomorrow if you need help I will tell her very loud that you are a her\" I can't believe she just said this to me, I don't really know how to feel. I am SOO proud of her and so ashamed of myself ",

She was using the wrong pronouns all the time (in my language almost every word is gendered) which was weird bc she never acted that way. I said that ive been thinking about going to sexuologist to get a diagnosis. She said that its a bad idea cuz \"90% of trans people eventually accept their bodies (my body isnt the only problem, which she seemed to not understand) and that all of her trans patients eventually turned out to not be trans\" (ofc if you keep telling them that they are not trans they will just fold under pressure, duh...). I also told her that i talked about it with my parents but they are busy and forgot to set up an appointment with the sexuologist, and as an answer she told me that theyre just dont want me to \"ruin my body forever\" and that they wanna \"protect me from hurting myself\". She told me that im prolly just a gay man, which really threw me off guard cuz im yet to be romantically attracted to a cis guy.\n\nShe also pulled the usual bigot bs type \"sui rates skyrocket in ppl who transitioned\", \"hrt makes you unable to orgasm\" etc.\n\nI also got asked a bunch of pretty private questions regarding my sex life (mind you im underage) and idk maybe its normal for psychiatrists to ask theese questions i was just a lil suprised.\n\nShe was also rude to my dad. I really dont like her bc she acts like a totally diffrent person everytime i see her and its creeping me out.",
