It was also meant to push Democrats to abandon what Willis describes as \"a pattern of ignoring and sidelining the trans community\" in the face of escalating conservative attacks.”\n\n“Just hours after Willis’s interview with The Independent, House and Senate negotiators revealed a bipartisan compromise spending bill that would ban military health insurance from covering transition care for children. On Wednesday, 50 House Democrats who previously denounced that provision voted in favor, and key Senate Democrats said they would reluctantly back it too.”\n\n“Now, with Republicans taking control of all three branches of government and both houses of Congress in January, Willis is gearing up for a fight – and she does not believe trans people can afford to take their cues from Democrats.”\n\n\"We have to be prepared to take care of ourselves, and speak for ourselves, and fight for ourselves, because there are not enough political leaders who are sticking up for us,” she says.”\n",

This June, she was transferred to the Monroe Correctional Complex, a men’s prison, after receiving an infraction, as HuffPost originally reported.\n\n“It’s the first time in state history that a transgender person has been moved from gender-affirming housing back to housing that aligns with the gender they were assigned at birth.”\n\n“Kim’s transfer came about three months after she received an infraction for having sex with another incarcerated woman. The infraction report was leaked to a right-wing magazine and picked up by larger conservative media outlets, which misgendered Kim and implied it could not have been consensual. Kim says it was.\n\n“DOC policy says incarcerated transgender people placed in a gender-affirming facility may be transferred ‘due to documented, objective safety and security concerns.’”\n\n",

In his interview with the magazine, he said ‘the bathroom issue’ only pertains to a small amount of people and it's tearing the country apart. He also advocated for people to go ‘along with’ the Supreme Court's rulings.\n\n\"’I don't want to get into the bathroom issue. Because it's a very small number of people we're talking about, and it's ripped apart our country, so they'll have to settle whatever the law finally agrees,’ Trump said after being asked about whether ‘transgender people could use whatever bathroom they chose.’”\n\n“A spokesperson for Trump said that he has plans for Day 1 in office, which range from settling the Russian and Ukrainian war to removing protections for transgender students.\n\n\"’I am a big believer in the Supreme Court, and I'm going to go by their rulings, and so far, I think their rulings have been rulings that people are going along with,’ Trump said, ‘but we're talking about a very small number of people, and we're talking about it, and it gets massive coverage, and it's not a lot of people.’”\n\n“Trump said in his interview with TIME that he does agree with [Sarah] McBride, suggesting the lawmakers should be focused on more important issues.\n\n\"’I do agree with that,’ Trump said. ‘On that—absolutely. As I was saying, it's a small number of people.’”",

Our general existence has become a political punching bag. It sucks, and as a trans person, it can be hard to keep going sometimes.\n\n“But you turn this anger into hope, and remain confident that there are more good people in this world than bad who either don’t think much about transgender people living their lives (the vast majority), or do all they can to support them. We also search for purpose and representation in popular culture, which for younger audiences normally means the shows they watch, video games they play, and people they follow online. There is plenty of positive queer reinforcement to be found, but again and again, the biggest corporations on the planet have made it clear we are nothing more than a demographic to be taken advantage of.”\n",

While the Supreme Court didn’t say why it declined to hear the case, a lower court had ruled against the parents because, it said, they didn’t have standing to sue since they didn’t demonstrate the policy affected their children.”\n\n“The parents claim the school’s policy facilitates ‘gender identity transitions at school’ and keeps the effort ‘hidden from parents who would disagree that it is in their child’s best interest.’\n\n“Eau Claire Area School District officials counter that gender support plans are included in a student’s record and are available for parents to see. The policy, school officials said, is intended ‘to provide support to students who express concern about their gender identity.’\n\n“‘The issue in the Wisconsin case is less about the underlying question of parental rights, and more about what plaintiffs have to show before they’re allowed to challenge government actions that may not have happened and may not ever happen,’ said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.”\n\n“Similar cases have made their way to the Supreme Court before. The justices in May denied an appeal from a group of parents in suburban Washington who made the same argument. The challenge for the parents groups is being able to demonstrate that they were specifically harmed by the policy.”",

In his plea agreement, Benza admitted that he lied to the FBI about the incident and alleged that numerous other deputies and sergeants helped obstruct the investigation and cover up the misconduct.”\n\n“Sheriff’s officials would not specify how many employees have been sidelined, but half a dozen sources in the department told The Times that eight people — including several sergeants — were relieved of duty. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.”\n\n“Benza is due back in court Jan. 17, when he is expected to plead guilty to one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison.”\n",

If the proposed regulations were left in their current state, the next administration would be able to rewrite them and advance its agenda more quickly.”\n\n“As the pending Biden regulations are withdrawn, nothing prevents Trump from pursuing his own regulations on the same issues when he returns to the White House, but he would have to start from scratch in a process that can take months or even years.”\n\n“For the regulation on transgender students, the department said it was withdrawing the proposal because of ongoing litigation over how Title IX, the landmark law preventing sex discrimination, should handle issues of gender identity. In addition, the department said there were 150,000 public comments with a range of feedback, including suggestions for modifications that needed to be considered.”\n\n“Biden’s rule on transgender sports was proposed in 2023 but was delayed multiple times. It was supposed to be a follow-up to his broader rule that extended civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ students under Title IX.”",

Some in same-sex relationships are making plans to marry or adopt children. Others are moving to states that they believe will offer them more protection. Transgender people are stockpiling medications, worried that their access to gender transition care will be cut off.\n\n“Trump has vowed to prohibit gender transition care for children and eliminate any federal spending on those treatments for adults. He has also promised to ask Congress to pass a bill stating that there are only two genders and that they are assigned at birth. And the incoming president wants to use Title IX protections to ensure that transgender women can’t play on women’s sports teams.”\n\n",

Many starve themselves or develop other harmful eating behaviors to make their bodies conform to a masculine or feminine ideal. Studies estimate that 25% to more than 50% of trans people have had eating disorders, compared with 9% of the overall population.\n\n“Yet transition-related care is increasingly out of reach for minors struggling with gender dysphoria, the acute distress that results from a mismatch between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity. Most U.S. medical associations consider transition-related care to be essential for minors struggling with gender dysphoria.”\n",

That same day, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—architect of an AI-powered claims denial system with a reported 90 percent error rate—was shot, allegedly by a man driven to desperation by America’s predatory and labyrinthine health care system, which causes as many as 66.5 percent of American bankruptcies.\n\n“The grim symmetry was impossible to ignore. The parallel path of these two events perfectly encapsulates the cynical sleight of hand at the heart of the American establishment’s current political strategy. While millions struggle under the weight of medical debt and economic precarity, our political class has masterfully redirected public anger toward a manufactured crisis: the supposed threat of transgender Americans. By scapegoating trans people, they divert attention from the systemic failures killing and impoverishing our neighbors. This phenomenon is what sociologists call displacement, where economic anger and despair are redirected onto marginalized groups rather than the systems and structures that are actually causing the suffering. While the threats to trans people are real and growing, the threat of trans people is a nonexistent distraction, and attacking us will do nothing to address Americans’ real material concerns.”",

For example, the implementation of the New York Equal Rights Amendment into the state constitution, as well as state shield laws that protect those who practice gender-affirming care. \n\n“As a result, some, like Gray, expect to see an influx of LGBTQ+ people move to upstate New York.\n\n‘He said he’s received calls and emails from those in other states, such as Oklahoma or South Dakota, where anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ+ laws have passed in recent years. Many call with hopes that moving to New York will provide protection for them.”",

That proximity creates the kind of collegiality that, while not constant, is often lacking these days in Washington.”\n",

The decision, which is expected by summer, stands to impact similar laws passed in half the country. \n\n“Last month, the justices at two consecutive conferences mulled whether to take up appeals from Idaho and West Virginia defending their bans on transgender girls competing on women’s school sports teams. \n\n“The justices took no action and did not relist the petitions for discussion at any of their December conferences, court dockets show, effectively placing the cases in indefinite limbo. Though the court provided no explanation, that pattern typically occurs when the justices have decided to hold a petition pending the disposition of a current case.\n\n“The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) did not object to the move.”\n\n“Both West Virginia and Idaho unsuccessfully cautioned the Supreme Court against waiting.”\n\n",

    "selftext": "“Earlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in what is likely to be the term’s blockbuster case, United States v. Skrmetti. The case considers the constitutionality of state laws that ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors. While the case itself addresses only a law from Tennessee, 26 states have passed similar laws that will be affected by the outcome.\n\n“A blanket ban on such care risks devastating effects for those youth who need it. But as the argument made clear, that is not all that is at stake. The case is also about women’s rights, and a fundamental legal principle that helped to secure them: Courts should be skeptical of laws that discriminate on the basis of sex.\n\n“With the defenders of Tennessee’s law challenging that bedrock principle, it is not only transgender equality, but sex equality more broadly that is in doubt. Depending on the outcome, Skrmetti could be the next Dobbs, adding another nail in the coffin to women’s legal freedoms — and freedoms we all enjoy regardless of sex.”\n\n“The Tennessee law — and trans discrimination more generally — is not only about discrimination against trans people, but about ensuring that we all keep in our gender lanes. As [U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth] Prelogar explained, the law here is ‘one that prohibits inconsistency with sex,’ requiring that children born as boys and girls ‘look and live like boys and girls.’ Tennessee’s argument would call into question the longstanding freedom we all enjoy to live our lives as we wish, regardless of sex.\n\n“Far from being a neutral law that applies evenhandedly to males and females, the law at issue here is of a piece with a gender hierarchy that prizes masculinity while narrowly circumscribing femininity. \n\n“Medical treatments that would reduce the fertility of trans boys and men threaten the idea of women being mothers first (and anything else second or not at all). A friend-of-the-court brief from leading conservative anti-abortion group, Alliance Defending Freedom, worried that, ‘If both a boy and a girl are considering a mastectomy, only the girl gives up the ability to breastfeed her future child.’  Scare tactics about girls renouncing maternity are part of anti-trans politics, with the cover of conservative critic Abigail Shrier’s book, Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters, showing a young girl with a blank space where her uterus would be. \n\n“These anxieties about women rejecting motherhood are the very same ones that motivate much of the opposition to abortion — and they are grounded upon the very same sex stereotypes that the equal protection clause is meant to abolish.”",

Next best time: right now.\n\n“If that wasn’t already apparent, Wednesday’s Supreme Court arguments in a challenge to Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors makes it crystal clear.”\n\n“[O]nly 14 states (Massachusetts included) and the District of Columbia have laws in place shielding the ability of doctors, their patients, and patients’ families to act according to their needs, wishes, and the proper standard of medical care, according to the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project. Two more states have executive orders currently in place protecting access to transgender health care.\n\n“Astonishingly, according to MAP, 34 states have passed no transgender health care protection rules at all.\n\n“They have not learned one of the most crucial lessons from the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade: Beware the unintended yet foreseeable consequences.”\n\n“It was not just abortion access protections that were stripped from people in states that banned it after Dobbs. The health care implications were much wider, with some providers in states with laws defining life at fertilization choosing to halt in-vitro fertilization procedures for fear of liability. There is confusion about the legal status of frozen eggs and embryos. The incoming Trump administration creates uncertainty over the ongoing availability of not only medications for abortions but also that of some contraceptives. Maternity health care providers are fleeing states with abortion bans.”",

Legislation passed last year protects the privacy of patients accessing gender-affirming care and shields medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas.”\n\n“Minnesota’s relatively strong job market and economy are a draw for those seeking access to care, and the high cost of living for ‘shield states’ on the east or west coasts deters people from states with lower median incomes, Rohn said.”\n\n“Housing is a considerable obstacle for many transplants — the housing crisis in the Twin Cities affects everybody, but the absence of a dedicated LGBTQ+ shelter is a risk for anyone relocating without guaranteed access to housing, Charley [who requested his last name not be used] said.“\n\n“‘And you can’t sleep in your car,’ Charley said. ‘I talked to a transplant last year who was talking about doing anything to get out of Texas and mentioned in February living in a car.’”",

The first occurred on Oct. 18 and the second on Nov. 12, both near a Chevron gas station in the 100 block of Ponce de Leon Drive in Northeast Atlanta. \n\n“In both cases, the victims — transgender women — sustained facial injuries after being punched. Officers found the victims with swollen faces and black eyes.\n\n“In the Nov. 12 assault, police responded to a report of a dispute near 160 Ponce de Leon Avenue NE. The victim reported being approached by two men near a gas station and followed to another location, where the suspects physically assaulted her. Officers noted that the victim’s eye was bruised and swollen. \n\n“Witnesses corroborated the account, and one of the suspects, Michael Boykin, fled the scene but was later linked to the incident.\nA security officer familiar with Boykin reported that he has a history of physically assaulting members of the transgender community in the area. Another suspect was arrested and charged with battery and criminal trespass for damaging a witness’s phone during the assault.”",

Virgil asked that KUOW not publish his last name because he’s worried about anti-trans backlash.\n\n“‘Safety, of course, was our first priority, but we also wanted to live somewhere that’s nice to live, and I’ve always just loved the Pacific Northwest,’ Virgil said.\n\n“But now, just two years after they arrived, Virgil and his partner aren’t sure they’ll be safe here anymore either, and they’re preparing to potentially leave the country.\n\n“Virgil is one of many transgender people who are worried about what President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration means for them.\n\n“Trump’s campaign promises include asking Congress to make gender-affirming care of children illegal, and ending all federal funding (such as through Medicare and Medicaid) for gender-affirming care for adults. He also promised to ask Congress to declare that there are only two genders — male and female — and they are assigned at birth, and to use Title IX to ensure that transgender women cannot compete on women’s sports teams.\n\n“As for same-sex marriage, some in the LGBTQ+ community are worried that, because that was a right granted by the Supreme Court, the current court, which has a conservative supermajority, could decide to rescind it. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in the case that overturned Roe v. Wade that the justices should revisit same-sex marriage.\n\n“After the November election, Seattle’s LGBTQ+ Center filled with people looking for a place to process.”\n\n",

Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed in 2023 — are overly broad and vague, and violated librarians’, booksellers’ and patrons’ First Amendment rights.\n\n“The two parts of the law that were struck down would have established a criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison, for librarians and booksellers who distribute ‘harmful’ material to a minor. It also would have required local governments to create oversight boards to review challenged content, which often deal with themes of race and sexuality. The ruling, which will likely be challenged, comes as a growing number of GOP-controlled statehouses have considered similar laws that threaten librarians with prison.”\n\n“Lawmakers that propose these bills contend they are necessary because school and public libraries contain graphic sexual material that should not be available to children. Arkansas state Sen. Dan Sullivan (R), who introduced Arkansas Act 372, said at the time that the law protects children and doesn’t harm librarians unless they’re doing something awful.”\n\n“But others say bills like Sullivan’s are ideologically driven censorship cloaked as concern for children, noting that as book challenges spiked to historic highs over the past two years, the majority of objections targeted books by and about LGBTQ people and people of color, including ‘All Boys Aren’t Blue’ by George M. Johnson and ‘Gender Queer’ by Maia Kobabe.”",
