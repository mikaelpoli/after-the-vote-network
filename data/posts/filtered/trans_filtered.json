    "selftext": "Okay, so this was a while back when I first started public school again, and at the time, I passed pretty well, if I still looked a bit fem due to my round face. Well, I explained to the school that I was trans and asked about being able to possibly use gender neutral bathrooms/locker rooms, or if I could just use the men's. And considering this is a school in Texas, they told me no and that I couldn't even use the gender neutral ones because those were really meant for disabled kids/teachers. I shrugged and said \"alright if that's what you want me to do\" and started school.\n\nAnyway, gym class rolls around and I am stoked, I love exercising and running around like a feral rat child so gym has basically always been recess for me. The teacher sends us off to the locker room to get our lockers for the year and change our clothes. I had to stay behind for a second so I could ask how the locker combos worked (different from my old school) but after that I ran off to the locker rooms to change. It's very important that we note that I was one of the last people to enter.\n\nI walk in, and immediately, at least 3 girls yell, \"WRONG ROOM\" and \"GET OUT\" while covering themselves. I jumped and looked around cuz I assumed a guy had followed me in here, but nope, I was the only person near the door. I turn back around and a bunch of the girls are scrambling to cover themselves, others are glaring, and one of them is even starting to walk towards me to push me out.\n\nNow I'm confused, so I ask. \"Isn't this the girls locker room?\"\n\nThe girl walking towards me to push me out, scoffs. \"Yeah, GET OUT.\" and then she starts literally shoving me towards the door.\n\nIt then dawns on me what has happened, and I'm not sure whether to be happy, embarrassed, apologetic or what. But I quickly stammer out that I'm trans but afab so the school told me to use these locker rooms. This gives the girls some pause and the girl shoving me stops. But everyone still looks very skeptical and uneasy\n\nSo I do the first thing I can think of, I take off my shirt to show that I'm wearing a binder while very panickly saying \"see, I'm not a creepy dude I swear.\" \n\nAnyway, they all look uncomfortable, end up asking a few more questions before letting me use the locker rooms in peace. I think that's the end of it and I now have a funny story to tell my friends after school. \n\nIt was, in fact, not the end. \n\nTurns out a small group of those girls, in their words, \"really uncomfortable with a man in the locker rooms, even if he doesn't have a dick and balls.\" (I'm giggling at kicking my feet at this sentiment) so they all band together and complain to administration about how they are making the locker rooms uncomfortable for everyone by putting me in there.\n\nAdministration does not back down, basically saying in fancy terms that I was born a girl so I am girl and I was going to use the girls locker rooms. The group of girls are furious on my behalf, but it gets so much worse when they learn I was using the girl's bathrooms too.\n\nTurns out, there are some girls that don't take gym but do use the bathrooms often, that are also annoyed with my presence. They join up with the girls and continue hounding administration to just let me use the other bathrooms because literally everyone is uncomfortable with my presence. Keep in mind, I have no clue that they are doing this.\n\nAnyway, one girl apparently complains to her mom about this and her mom is furious that the school is sacrificing not only my comfort, but all the girls comfort just to uphold their bigotry. She storms into the school and yells at the principal, threatening to sue.\n\nWell, that's all it took for the principal to get on the intercoms, call me down to the office, slam the gender neutral locker room/ bathroom key in my hand, and say that I was allowed to use whatever bathroom I was comfortable using.\n\nMoral of the story, even if your transphobic, if someone passes well enough, don't try to shove them in with the wrong gender, it just makes everyone uncomfortable",

    "selftext": "My Grandma has made a tradition out of personally making Christmas stockings for all of her children, grandchildren, and in-laws, each one with that person’s name and birthday on them. My stocking was made just a few months after I was born, and since then she has fixed it twice.\n\nThe first time was when I was almost too young to even remember it. We spent the holiday at my uncle’s house and his dog tore through my stocking trying to get the candy inside it. My grandma was able to fix it but it still has a bit of a scar and that actually ended up making my stocking much longer than any of my siblings. \n\nThe second time she fixed it was just this week. See, about 2.5 years ago I came out as transgender, and ever since then Christmas has been rough for me. Not just because it was always such a Christian centered holiday in my house, but also because my family and my stocking were no longer using the correct name. In the last year, I have been much more open about my identity with my family despite the fact that they are pretty much all conservative and Christian. Surprisingly, a lot of them have been pretty good about using the correct name. A couple of weeks ago, I asked my grandma if she would be able to change the name on my stocking, and to my surprise, she told me that she had already started doing exactly that! I’m so grateful that my family is doing their best to acknowledge and accept my identity. I know it hasn’t been easy for them, but it’s great to see that they’re making progress. ",

You know, androgynous, dyed red and green hair, punk jacket, a visible rainbow flag patch on said jacket.\n\nI complimented the hair, saying \"oh that's cool, did you do red and green for christmas?\" And the response was \"Yes! But I'm going back to brown for the holidays because my family won't like it, I can't find the semi-permanent brown though.\"\n\nI said \"aw that sucks, looks cool though!\" And one of the workers I'm familiar with came over considering I'm there like every other week and asked if we needed any help. I said \"Oh, well they're looking for semi-permanent brown dye, they already have developer.\" While gesturing to the person I met next to me.\n\nThis persons face instantly changed to one of disgust and went, \"They? My pronouns are He/It ONLY. NOT they/them.\"\n\nI genuinely froze up because for one, I hate misgendering people, but at the same time I was confused. I only used \"they\" considering we never discussed each others pronouns, I figured it was pretty common knowledge that unless discussed beforehand, \"they\" is an acceptable term to refer to a stranger as if you don't know how they identify, out of respect.\n\nI paused awkwardly because I'm not really good with confrontation and I couldn't fathom why this person looked so genuinely upset, even the worker looked uncomfortable. After a few seconds I quickly apologized with, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know, if I had known you used he/it I wouldn't have used \"they\". I only used it because I wanted to be respectful and didn't know how you identified. It wont happen again.\"\n\nI was then met with \"Yeah, well I'm NOT non-binary or whatever. I don't want to be grouped with that.\"\n\nAnd then I paused again, thinking, \"Is this person who's under the transgender umbrella simultaneously enby-phobic?\"\n\nGenuine curiosity got the better of me and I asked why he thought that way, and he said that it was because of all the \"neo-pronoun bullshit\" and \"making up terms that don't need to exist for attention, making the rest of the trans community look bad\".\n\nThen he threw in the word \"trans trender\" and I immediately knew where the conversation was going. I shook my head, grabbed my black hair dye, went to the counter and left in a flabbergasted state.\n\nUSING THE TERM \"TRANS-TRENDER\" IN 2024?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\n\nThe person looked to be around 15-16 years old so I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but damn. It felt like I was having a conversation with the reincarnate of Kalvin Garrah for a hot minute. I am now reluctant to go back to that Sally's location because I don't want to run into him again. I understand having your own opinions about the current state of the trans community but holy shit dude, there's no need to be hateful.\n\n\n",

Every time I was in the room Alan would direct comments at what he considered \"my weakness\", calling me homophobic and transphobic slurs and in the latest days even trowing objects or hitting me and playing it off as a joke.\n\nAs I hope you'll understand, I wasn't quite happy with this. Yesterday we had a clash when I threw back back one of the fruits Alan had been throwing it me, we didn't get into a fight because the quiet guy was able to take him away. Today that didn't happen.\n\nThings got even worse today than before and at one point he hit me very badly in the neck while going past me, again trying to play it off as a joke. I got really, really mad and threw a bag that was nearby at him and then Alan jumped at me. I don't really remenber anything about that exchange other than the fact that he tried to choke me (fortunately failed) but was able to open a pretty big breach on my head. Then my other roomate was able to get him off me. That was a few hours ago. Alan is getting hammered next door and I am sitting in the bed of our room waiting for this whole shitshow to be over. God I hate this so much",

This is something I never really expected to happen as I’m an only child and she never really seemed interested in having more kids but here we are. My mom has always said that if she ever had a daughter she would name it a certain name. I have never came out to her because she’s slightly transphobic; I don’t think she’d kick me out or anything if she found out but she definitely wouldn’t be happy. So I figured that if maybe I made my chosen name the name she always wanted for a daughter maybe she’d be less mad when I eventually came out to her...\n\nWell we found out yesterday that my mom is having a girl and she has already said that my chosen name will be her name. I can’t help but be so upset by this because that was the only name I could decide on. There are many other girl names I like but I could never decide on which I liked more so I can’t help but feel like I’ll never find a name for me. \n\nI don’t know what to do 😭",

She was using the wrong pronouns all the time (in my language almost every word is gendered) which was weird bc she never acted that way. I said that ive been thinking about going to sexuologist to get a diagnosis. She said that its a bad idea cuz \"90% of trans people eventually accept their bodies (my body isnt the only problem, which she seemed to not understand) and that all of her trans patients eventually turned out to not be trans\" (ofc if you keep telling them that they are not trans they will just fold under pressure, duh...). I also told her that i talked about it with my parents but they are busy and forgot to set up an appointment with the sexuologist, and as an answer she told me that theyre just dont want me to \"ruin my body forever\" and that they wanna \"protect me from hurting myself\". She told me that im prolly just a gay man, which really threw me off guard cuz im yet to be romantically attracted to a cis guy.\n\nShe also pulled the usual bigot bs type \"sui rates skyrocket in ppl who transitioned\", \"hrt makes you unable to orgasm\" etc.\n\nI also got asked a bunch of pretty private questions regarding my sex life (mind you im underage) and idk maybe its normal for psychiatrists to ask theese questions i was just a lil suprised.\n\nShe was also rude to my dad. I really dont like her bc she acts like a totally diffrent person everytime i see her and its creeping me out.",
