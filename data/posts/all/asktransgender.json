    "selftext": "From a transgender woman to Kamala Harris, and to cisgender folk:\n\nRegarding your response about trans health care in your Fox interview...\n\nMy issue here is that there is an active campaign, that most cisgender people seem unaware of or downplay, to eradicate transgender people completely from public life, from self-determination, from bodily autonomy, from health care, from basic human rights of all kinds.\n\nWe, trans people as a demographic, are powerless in the face of this attack. There are simply not enough of us.\n\nThe ONLY power we have is in convincing cisgender people who are NOT bigots, who BELIEVE in equality and human rights, to take up the cause with us.\n\nMinimizing it. Refusing to engage. Not talking about it...these are accepting the war on us that's already happening. Letting it go. Saying \"It's not important enough to fight\". The status quo favors the oppressor. Inaction IS an action. Not choosing IS a choice.\n\n\"I'll follow the law.\" is not strong advocacy. What will you do if they change the law? Go along with eradication?\n\nHere's a strong response: \"Trans prisoners, like every other prisoner, are entitled, in fact required by the 8th amendment, to the same necessary medical care, as determined by them and their doctors, as any other prisoner.\"\n\nIf you think we're human. If you think we deserve the same rights and place in society as everyone else, GET IN THE GAME!\n\nBecause once they're done with us...they're coming for you next.\n\n  \nEdit: \n\nTo those saying: \"We still have to vote, and we sure as hell better vote for Harris.\" Yes. I agree!\n\nBut that does not mean we have to remain silent. If we don't speak up when our allies fall short, they'll never get better.\n\nSilence is complicity. Silence is accepting the status quo.\n\nWe can do better. They can do better.",

    "selftext": "Well hi my name is Corey I'm 23 amab I had a pretty normal childhood I think....I was the fraternal twin to my brother. I never really compared myself with him as we got along really well. But my life started to change around the time of puberty. My brother developed normally but I was a late Bloomer. I was always confused about my own identity since I had the sex ed talk in fifth grade. I noticed that I didn't have the changes that many of my peers had. This was around the time I heard what transgender was. Their was this girl with the same name as me fighting for bathroom Rights in school. That was the moment I really became fascinated with the whole experience. I watched every YouTube video, timelines , make up, boy to girl etc.\n\n\n As I began to crack my egg so to speak I started to keep my hair long and paint my nails with nail polish I bought at dollar tree.. I always had a stash of girly things hidden in my room scared of being found out. I thought I was just a sick pervert.\n\n But as the years passed my family just thought I was gay. I was always flamboyant since I was younger so they were sort of excepting. As I gotten my first job at a major retail store during my last year in highschool 2019.  I began to buy more and more feminine clothes then I dyed my hair burgundy red. Mixing that with having to wear a mask most people didn't think I was a man ironically getting mis gendered in embarrassing ways. Customer's would say that a woman helped them then my coworker's would correct them as I came back to help. This really made me feel wonderful hearing she and her then swiftly getting stabbed in my heart at my coworker's words. \n\nThat was when I started hrt. Then I got scared of how fast the changes happened so I stopped treatment.  Trying to make myself be as masculine as my brother. I began to get into sports and helping him with his car. But I felt like I was going against my nature. So these last few months I have begun to secretly transition again... Mostly due to me getting my first apartment finally away from my family. \n\nSo I have been really happy with how it's going. But then I got my first tattoo recently and it wouldn't heal so I went to the dermatologist and found out that I have psoriasis and they prescribed me humira a biologic to help with my skin... But I had to get a full panel of blood work. Before I could get my prescription. Then I went back to my dermatologist for my follow up appointment and for them to show me how to use the injection properly.\n\n That's when they ask me for my preferred pronouns probably because I was dressed pretty fem and I let them know about my hrt. That's when my dermatologist asked me why I was on it. I said that I was transitioning she then asked me if it was a typo because it said estradiol then she said that was strange for a biological Female... I then stated that I was born male at birth she looked at me confused then as we discussed different things she then came to the conclusion for me to get a chromosome test done and Lord behold I am intersex female and my parents knew about it and never told me... Here I am thinking I'm going through this wholesome process of self discovery then bam the answer to the feelings about my own identity and why I always felt off.\n\n I really can't tell you how much this revelation has changed how I feel about myself.. I am for all intensive purposes. Female not just something in my mind but my entire being. Now I have even greater issues because I don't know if I can identify as trans but I am transitioning.... I really don't know what I should do moving forward?\n\n(*every one's experience is valid I was not referring to it just being in anyone's mind just how I felt)\n\nUpdate: so I just had an appointment today with a specialist. I was formally diagnosed as a pseudo female hermaphrodite. Ps I don't like that terminology\n\nAlso was diagnosed with CAH : congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  Which is why I had some minor male puberty development...\n\nI also want to say thank you All for your support and suggestions.  I was and still processing all this new information about my body and am in the process of figuring out my next steps...\n\nI will start identifying as both trans and intersex.. mostly because it's easier to just tell them I'm trans than having to explain something I'm still confused about myself. I already have had issues discussing this stuff with my family. Ps I'm not talking to my parents until we can all go to therapy.",

Twice when I was using the bathroom and once when I was changing. I could clearly see him through the door and when I confronted him about it he would deny it and yell at me and bully me. I called my mom and cried about it the other day and she just refused to believe me because my cousin called her and said that he was trying to \"bring me on the right track\".

He just messaged me asking if I blocked him. Idek what to say. I feel so spineless playing with someones emotions like that but I wish he just took my first message and left on his own accord. Why do I have to pull him off me like this? It's disturbing. Help. Advice, anything.\n\n  \nedit: Thanks everyone. I decided I just won't be replying, and likely blocking his number if he ever messages me again. (Or just cus). I needed this push. Thanks.",

My (18F) little sister (16mtf), transitioned early and loves to use the computer on discord. She has recently gotten into a side of discord that is obsessed w being small and cute and that keeps saying that only trans girls that transition early are desirable, etc. She's gotten anorexia be of this as well and keeps comparing herself to cis girls' weights.\n\n\nEarlier, I was working when a pretty and tall transgender woman flirted with me, to which I flirted back (l'm lesbian). I told my sister about it and the first thing she said was \"did you clock her or did she tell you?\"\nHere’s how the convo went:\nMe:she was a random person at work (talking abt the pretty girl)\nHer: cute, did you clock her or did she say she was trans?\nMe:…. Clocked her?\nHer: oh RIP\nMe (confused):… she had a deep voice and long hair dress and heels\nHer: so probably not a ‘youngshit’ \n(as if this was a bad thing??)\nMe: a what???\nHer:Youngshit is someone who started hormones young, I’m a youngshit\nMe:I don’t care if she started hormones young tho \nHer: they call them that bc some people in trans communities hate them bc we’re cuter\nMe: a girl is a girl idc, yall aren’t “cuter”\nHer: Well we pass more\nMe: I don’t care about “passing”. That doesn’t mean you’re cuter.\nHer: “yap, yap”.\nMe:…. \n\n When I said \"I clocked her\" she responded by saying people like her were better and \"rip\" that she was not someone who started hormones wrong, saying \"we pass more\" and stuff. It really weirded me out. Do you have any advice for what I should do? I tried to tell her that passing doesn't matter to me but I don’t think it did anything. Thanks everyone.\n",

Well, we were debating in Trans Right in Government and Economics Tuesday, and this girl closed the argument by saying Trans people are mentally unstable, and need help. To say you're Trans is saying God made a mistake. God doesn't make mistakes. That's not verbatim, but it's pretty much what she said. No hate like Toxic Christian Love. But the thing is she's temporarily seated next to me now, and when she saw my pride pin, she scoffed. So I was wondering if I should put my  Protect Trans Kids Pin on, and put on full display. \nShould I do it?\n\nEdit: WOW. This blew up in an hour. I'm thankful for all the comments you have given me. And some people rightfully pointed out that it seemed like I was just wearing it to be instigative. Some even said my heart was in the right place. So I'm going to wear the pin as a way to support the kids. But an added bonus would be spiting the girl and Additional transphobes like her. Thank y'all are so much!!!\n\nUpdate: So I wore it to school today, and the girl didn't even show up. But I found out, and I swear I'm not making this up, that on her way to school she got into a car accident. She's not hurt though. Her car is just damaged. Am I allowed to say Karma? Or not. ",

I've never interacted with a lot of lgbt people before, I've been neutral to you guys to be honest, hope that doesn't come off as rude, but I'm willing to learn.\n\nI've been straight my entire life. Young, old, middle-age, doesn't matter as long as it's a she. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a few months now, and I find her to be one of the best things to happen to me. She's funny, sweet, sassy, smart, and kinda wholesome.\n\nLike, one time she went to one of my amateur boxing bouts, I took a pretty nasty shot to my ribs (yeah, I lost that fight 😭) and I was limping afterwards and my lip was bleeding. She wouldn't leave my side no matter what, and even put my arm around her shoulder to help me move around. She scolded twice for forgetting to study for two tests, but let me cheat off her paper 💀\n\nI never really knew she was trans, to me she's a normal girl, she looks like a pretty girl, she acts like a girl, and she sounds like a girl. My God, the doctor who was responsible needs a big raise. She always squieks when I sometimes slap her behind playfully.\n\nSo, how did I find out she was trans? Her older sister told me. It was a huge shock, because I always thought that the little boy in her family pictures was her older brother who died, but nope, that was her.\n\nWhen I confronted her about it, she started to tear up and ran away, I just stood there like a moron dumbfounded. Her sister called me, my gf blew up at her. Sister told me that gf never told me because she was terrified at how I'd react and she was ashamed. Why would she be ashamed?\n\nIt's been a day now, and she's been avoiding me. Her sister told me to give her some space, cuz she'll talk to me eventually. I don't really care about what sex she was born as, I love her, that's what I care about. Ngl, I still find her hot.\n\nEDIT: I apologize for sounding gross. Thank you for the advice. I mean no ill intent, I promise. As for how I confronted her, we were talking one day and I asked her \"that little boy in the pictures at your house, that's you, right?\" and then it extended from there.\n\n**UPDATE:** She texted me now! 😭🙌 we're meeting up tomorrow!

They exchanged numbers, then she told him she was trans. He is now asking other men if it should be a law that trans women have to disclose the fact that they're trans before kissing someone, because he is now \"disgusted\" with the whole experience. \n\nObviously this is blatantly transphobic, but they genuinely don't view it that way (most likely because they have little to no experience with trans people). I am not trans, but I wanted to know how you all viewed this scenario and how you approach these things with people in real life knowing that there are people who think this way.\n\nFrom where I stand as a gay, cis man, I genuinely wouldn't have a problem with kissing someone and enjoying my time with them and then finding out he's a trans man. Like, why would I care? All we did was kiss, and I literally enjoyed it? So why would I suddenly change my mind just because I found out he's trans? He still looks and acts exactly like the hot guy I thought he was back when I was kissing him, and that's still how I view him, even if I now know he has a vagina. So I seriously don't get it whenever straight men like the one who posted that are \"disgusted\" afterwards. \n\nOther straight, cis men in the comments are saying it's akin to sexual assault and/or coercion because he was manipulated/deceived by her. I don't think that counts as deception at all. He pursued \\*her\\* because he thought she was attractive. He enjoyed kissing her the whole time. She did everything right, before they actually went home together and got sexual she told him she was trans so that he knew what to expect. Then he changed his mind and has since been \"disgusted\". I don't know how to tell these people that, no, you were not \"lied to\" or \"deceived\" by her. Gender and sex aren't the same thing, and the fact that you confuse cis and trans women literally proves that. So if you were attracted to \\*her\\* as a person and now you're not solely because you found out she's trans, that doesn't mean she \"deceived you\". \n\nDo you know what I'm trying to say here? I need someone to put this into better words than me. Why does it bother me that straight, cis men are calling this \"deception\"? And what exactly are they so disgusted by? The OP of that post literally said he is totally fine with trans people and treats them with respect, but I feel like that can't be true if he was disgusted by that experience.",

The only downside is that because of the cut and because she's a bit \"above average\" in that regard, she's very \"visible.\" She has very little bottom dysphoria and doesn't intend to seek bottom surgery in the future, and I want to make it clear that I have no problems with this. It's her body and her decision and I love her no matter what. My concern comes from the fact that I don't know if she *knows* how visible it is, and I could see her being embarrassed about that. \n\nI see four options: \n1) Knows, doesn't care: no problems\n2) Knows, cares: seems unlikely, she probably would have at least tried to do something about it\n3) Doesn't know, doesn't care: no problems, I guess?\n4) Doesn't know, cares: herein lies the issue\n\nI know *I* would want to know if this was the case, but A) I have a LOT more bottom dysphoria than she does, and B) I also know I'd probably never wear those jeans again if I couldn't get a satisfactory tuck. I don't want to ruin those jeans for her if it is a concern for her. \n\nAlso I apologize if the formatting got fucked up here, I'm on the mobile site. \n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the advice and suggestions everyone. I took the top comment's idea to try to broach it as a hypothetical... evidently not very subtlely though. She knew exactly what I was talking about and while it wasn't *exactly* #1, the jeans provide more euphoria than the bulge does dysphoria for her. I'm glad, maybe I'm selfish but I like seeing her wearing them :) Thanks again, everyone!",

I have a transgender girlfriend (I’ve made posts about us before) and I do my best to support her and the community when I can.\n\n I’m working on a freelance project right now and the manager is a retired cop (that tells you everything you need to know, really) and he was talking about how his stepdaughter came out to him as trans and he said “my stepson comes up and he tells me “hey I want you to call me “she” now” and I’m just like…IM MOT CALLING YOU THAT!” and talked about how she found an online group of friends who “fuckin manipulated him into thinking he was a girl” and said a bunch of bullshit similar to that. When he was done I just looked up at him and without thinking said out loud “okay boomer” and kept doing what I was doing. A moment later I realized three people were looking at me like “holy shit did you just say that” and the manager was just kinda like “yeah whatever” and we moved on\n\nI have ASD so sometimes my social barometer is broken and right now I could use some outside perspective on whether or not I made the right call. My girlfriend seemed REALLY happy and proud of me for doing this, but she can be a shit stirrer (as can I) so maybe she’s not the most diplomatic person to ask. There’s the matter of not wanting to get into any trouble with the manager, but something I struggle with is trying to understand when it’s my turn to talk as a cis male. I’m not trans so it’s not like I was directly being attacked by his bullshit rant, so maybe I shouldn’t have interfered on someone else’s behalf.\n\nAny thoughts?\n",

    "selftext": "So, for those not aware, Emily Bridges is a former professional cyclist who transitioned after having set national records in the junior men's catagory. She faced a massive pushback attempting to enter the woman's competition after transitioning. Frankly, I don't think most of the pushback came from people who genuinely believed she would be at an advantage. Rather it was fear of what she might prove that led to the resistance that ultimately led to most trans-woman being banned from competition.\n\nEmily Bridges, as far as I'm aware, is currently the only trans-woman who was a formal national record holder and would have otherwise been able to compete in the women's category within a few years of her previous performance. This made her an unprecedented athlete in being able to examine her performance before and after her transition at such a high level of competition. She was already participating in a study measuring performance before and after transition and has stated a 12% drop in performance since she started. This should have put her on par with other women as the gap between elite men and women in cycling is about 12%.\n\nYes, she could have broken records in the women's category, but she could have also done the same in the open category had she not transitioned. What mattered was showing her performance was reasonable given her previous performance. Her drop in performance was in line with existing evidence on trans-women competing in sports of raw speed or cardiac endurance. Despite the evidence being available, the paper justifying the rule change downplayed the studies in question. The paper referenced things such as differences in q-angle as grounds for the rule change in spite of evidence that showed trans-women experience elite-level-gap drops in performance regardless of variables such as q-angle.\n\nI just wanted to get this out cause it's frustrating, and seemingly no one has gone to show just how questionable the whole situation is. This woman's career basically ended because she transitioned, when it could have been promising even if she had never transitioned to begin with. There was no reason to be concerned about her potentially setting unbreakable records. This could have been a light shedding milestone, but it was stopped before it could go anywhere. I wish more of the media that claims to support us would shed light on matters like this.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Ok, so this happened three days ago, on Saturday. I am pretty shaken up from it, and having multiple panic attacks a day about it still, and unable to sleep, but I wanted to focus on the event itself, and how to handle this particular instance, and what to do if it happens again.\n\nI live in Virginia, and I am a trans woman, many years on HRT and medically transitioned. I was dressed in a belted thigh-length sun tunic, with black tights underneath, and wearing my normal shoes, and I was carrying my normal day bag. It was very clearly a woman's outfit, and not an outfit a man would have worn, and I felt my body's contours were clearly visible, making it easy to discern what sort of person I was physically. My hair is long, my body is incredibly feminine; I was well-presented. I pass very clearly as a woman but not perfectly as a cis woman.\n\n**The interaction itself:**\n\n**I approached the restroom, and it was on a separate restroom hallway guarded by a male guard. He saw me, and then he walked into the hallway, and into the men's room, and looked back at me. I entered the women's room at the mall, as I had there every week for 5 years, and passed one person on the way out, but no one else was there. My boyfriend, who was outside, told me that he saw the security guard sprint out, and get another security guard, and they both sprinted back to the women's room. I was in the restroom for about 30 seconds, when they stormed inside as a herd of buffalo, and slammed the door shut. The female guard was slamming things aggressively, and then asking me to come out, \"Sir, Miss? Please show yourself\".**\n\nI scrambled my clothing back on before I was able to urinate, and met her outside the stall, **and she told me that she just received a complaint from a distraught woman in fear for her safety** (which couldn't possibly be the case, as they got there lightning fast in a coordinated fashion; it was merely their ad hoc excuse to do this). **She stopped and detained me there, and told me I was not free to leave.**\n\n**She went on to berate me for about 5 minutes, telling me that as a man, that I was terrifying patrons, I did not belong there, and this was a serious offense, and etc, etc. I told her that I was a trans woman (and very clearly one), and she ignored me and repeated that I was a man, and had no claim to be there. She told me I was doing something devious and I needed to leave.** I began crying and having a panic attack (personal self-contempt / dysphoria stuff that was triggered by being told very firmly I was a man, unambiguously, and with no room for interpretation). I told her that this was an illegal exchange, and that she had no grounds for expelling me, and did not understand the laws. She continued berating me, and told me to use the other restrooms, as \"this room is only for females, and you are clearly not a female!\". I repeated that I was a trans woman, and medically female. I started having a very bad physical reaction, and I was afraid that I was having a stroke. I had a weird sensation in my head and neck, and green strobes in my vision. I looked in the mirror to check, but things seemed ok, other than that I was tomato red and covered in snot.\n\nShe would not relent, and I was verbally shooed out of the space, and I gladly left, because I was panicking and  felt like fleeing to remove myself from the stressor and the conflict.\n\nI went on to have an intense acute stress reaction for several days, and was unable to sleep. Whenever I sit or lie still, I involuntarily replay the scene in my head, and experience the negative emotions on loop... it's sort of torturous.\n\n**I'd like to know the right way to handle this kind of interaction in the future, given I live in Virginia. What should I say to these people?** I know that they have no right to put hands on me, or even to tell me to leave, but I was very afraid they would keep escalating, or call the police, or that someone (maybe the police?) could have assaulted me. **Rather than test things on the basic knowledge of the law I had there, I wanted to get a better grasp of what to do next time, and how to properly follow through on this harassment.**\n\n-------------  \n**Update:** So far I've contacted the TLDEF (they don't offer advice inquiries anymore, sadly), Senator Danica Roem, and the LGBTlifecenter in Norfolk. I am looking into legal advice from lawyers, but the challenge I am running into is that they all seem to prefer cases where damages can result, but I am not seeking damages for myself.

What if she just doesn't like anal? \n\nSo, I guess the question is, how do I give her pleasure?

Feel free to laugh at me for this, just please be kind.\n\nI (21ftm) was at a party where I met a friend of a friend (35m) and we got to talking. Went out to his truck for a cigarette, and in talking about being queer (he expressed he was bisexual with a preference for women) I told him I was trans. He expressed that it would be \"fun to get me off\" and spoke to me as a man the whole time. He talked a bunch of shit about how he can go for hours and his dick would change my life, but I honestly just wanted some good sex, so I went and met him at his place.\n\nWithin the first couple of minutes, he told me to take my binder off and \"show him my t*ts.\" Throughout intercourse, he called me \"good girl\" multiple times and told me I \"sing like a woman.\" He also said at one point \"I can't see your beard in the dark, so that's a plus.\" He did not touch my clit one time and I came nowhere close to orgasm. He fell asleep shortly after his orgasm, and I left feeling angry, disgusted, and completely unsatisfied.\n\nI want to make it very clear that I understand each person is responsible for their own orgasm during sex, it's no one's job to make you cum. I also understand that at any point I could have called stop, but I felt a sense of obligation once I had started. My question for fellow trans people is this: is this normal? Is it normal to be suddenly misgendered during sex by someone who has been fully respectful of you up to that point? Is it something you have to just accept if you want to sleep with cis people?

You know the type of texting that you get a response immediately after hitting send. \n\nShe told me the first day that she was trans and if I'm being entirely honest I was a little taken aback (I did not indicate this to her at all) at first because its not something I have experienced before and perhaps my subconscious prejudices came into play a bit.\n\nI text her back almost instantly saying that I didn't know that (which is true) and I don't care about that (which I quickly realised was also true).\n\nShe's such a sweet and funny person that I feel myself getting feelings for her fast, even though we've basically only met once and facetimed a few times. (I'm sorry I'm gushing I just feel tingly talking about her)\n\nLast night she turned the conversation sexual by saying something like \"it's only cold in your bed because I'm not there to warm you up xxx\" to which I responded \"wish you were here\" and then \"why what would you do to me if I were xxx\"\n\nI didn't really know what to say because tbh I'm not really sure what she has there or what she's into. I've read online that not all trans women have bottom surgery and some don't like their penises being touched, while some do. Some don't have \"sex\" because it is anal sex etc and prefer only oral sex.\n\nIt really doesn't bother me what she has but is it rude of me to maybe ask her to clarify what she has or what she is into? If she had a penis and was into it being touched I do not mind but I am conscious that it is something that many trans women do not want touched or even mentioned.\n\nI'm sorry for the long post but has anybody got any advice?\n\nEdit: I have to step out but will respond to everyone's replies as soon as I am back. I appreciate you so much.\n\nStay safe!\n\nEdit 2: wow, thanks for all the replies! I can't possibly reply to all of them but I am reading! If I don't reply to you I still value your input and am taking all advice on board. I am being educated today and am glad for it",

    "selftext": "\nI was gong to post screenshots from the text messages but this community doesn’t allow attachments. \n\nMy son asked me last night how I’d feel if he started taking estrogen supplements saying he doesn’t like his ‘parts’ and wants to feel different. He said this is because of the pregnancy podcasts I have been listening to the past month, which doesn’t make sense to me. I told him I’m happy to listen and be here to support him, but there are choices I can’t make for him, and it’s my job as his parent to guide him into he’s able to make those decisions. I suggested seeing a therapist/psychiatrist as he had in the past and as I believe it’s going to come up before any doctor would okay a transition. He told me he appreciated me talking to him and for not pushing him away ‘like his dad would’ (my ex) But I really don’t know what else to do or how to navigate this. I don’t want to suggest things (name change, clothing, hair etc) because I want him to tell me what he wants/needs. (Which is why I’m still using he/him pronouns because so far it’s not come up). We have trans friends and he’s aware people choose to transition differently. \n\n\nI’m having a hard time knowing how to navigate this news and what I should do moving forward. I think 13 is too young to ‘do’ anything medical, but I believe his feelings and what he is experiencing. Are there any other parents of trans kids here? What steps did you take to help them and hold space for them until they were old enough to make their own decisions? I don’t want my kid to think my suggesting therapy is because I think there is something ‘wrong’ with him, but I believe it’s an important part. Just so hard to find someone here in the Deep South who will be understanding of trans issues. \n\n\nMy main worry is about him being influenced by this one particular ‘friend’ that has been a romantic interest at school. In the past this boy has pushed for my son to appear more ‘feminine’ with clothes and haircuts. My son brought it up to me and I went along with it, then realized the source was this ‘friend’. The friend is quite an asshole kid and speaks degradingly to my son, calls him names, calls him gay, but then turns around and says they should date and be together. This kid is so controlling and my son seems to really want his approval. How do I know these feelings are genuinely from my son and not just to gain approval from a boy he likes?\n\nEdited to add: of course I cut contact with this kid, you think I’d see something like this and just let it continue to happen?! That doesn’t mean that I can erase their past interactions. Some of you are really dense and the fact that I have to SPELL it out is sad. \n\nAny thoughts, suggestions, advice is appreciated. \n \nEdited to add: \n\nWe live in GA so I’m going to have to look into what the laws are on puberty blockers and talk that over. \n\nI am married, and have an ex. Both of these men are going to have very big feels about this change, and I’m worried my ex will cause more grief for my child and will refuse to allow him to explore who he is. I cannot make medical decisions unilaterally, my ex has to agree. \n\nAlso, of course I love my son and I’ve told him as much. If I have to choose between him being in my life versus not being in my life - I’ll always choose him in my life. No matter how he chooses to show up. He will always be mine. ♥️\n\nSecondary edit:\n\nThank you to everyone who has taken the time to share advice and experiences. I was able to ask them some more general and open ended questions. It seems like ‘just not a boy’ is where they have landed and have asked to go by they/them as they continue to figure out what this means. It also seems they have a FtM trans friend who rides the bus and have been sharing experiences/thoughts surrounding dysphoria. They agreed to counseling and we will be locating a counselor who specializes in gender and trans teens. I’m thankful my kiddo feels safe and comfortable coming to me with such a heavy burden. I only hope I can help lighten the load. ",

What didn’t botter me at the time.\nWith time he always made comments here and there that he watched “it” again and again. For context since I knew him he always made negative remarks about porn. That he personally didn’t like that he watches it and how porn isn’t good for you etc. \nOne day he told me that he had experimented with a mtf woman pre op. What is totally fine my problem was how he kept misgendering her. I confronted him about it and he corrected himself.\nTime went by with remarks that he “sadly watched it again” and I always reassured him that there is nothing wrong with watching porn. \nSome days ago we went into a conversation about sexuality and gender. One thing lead to another and he tells me that he has a “trans fetish”. I asked him to elaborate what he meant by it and he said that he can only get off by watching a “woman with a dick”\nHe used the Trann*e Word and Si**y to describe his “taste”. I explain to him that such words are offensive to the Trans folk and that he shouldn’t use them. \nI then ask him, why is it important if the woman has or doesn’t have the genitalia. He bluntly says that the woman needs to have it to get him off and that if they were post op, they wouldn’t satisfy his fetish. And adds without me asking that he would never date a trans woman. And with that he finally triggered something in me. \nI myself was a victim of sexual assault and the objectification of woman is a theme that I frequently fight against and for me to wear how he objectifies trans woman by their genitalia gave me a bitter taste and to be honest disturbed me. \nMy brains just screams: if he objectifies trans women, what is holding him back to also objectify me? \nThe relationship has been until now good. There have been some things that I seem to realize more since this conversation. How he isn’t very affectionate or has problems showing his affection. And at the time I could even relate to that, but since then my brain keeps making connections with the misogyny and I don’t know if I am overthinking because of past trauma. Is there something that I could do? Any advice? Am I the only one that sees it as such a big thing? I am lost for words and I don’t know what to do.\nBtw if it helps by any means I am cis gendered pansexual woman, that for the longest time avoided dating cis men because of trauma.\n",

(it was very small). Also there was another complication.\n\nI had issues with one of my testicles going back up by itself as a child and it would cause me pain (*Doctor said this could be a sign. I confirmed this happened and he didn't seem to* believe *me*)\n\nI was mistaken as a girl as a child often ( *I had long hair which my parents forcibly cut...*)\n\nEven prior to HRT I had a slight curve to my hips (feminine , but my parents forced me into sports and stressed for me to gain muscle and not be fleshy)\n\nI grew breast buds as a young child pre teens ( went away from exercise and diet..I had undiagnosed dysphoria caused by bullying and parents forcing me into sports)\n\nI don't have many childhood photos..\n\n\\-------------\n\nI told all of this to my doctor and he didn't beleive me.

Do better.\n\nWhat doesn't help is all the added stress that is added onto me while I'm already in a distressed state. With the elections coming up, I could easily lose hope until adulthood, where I suspect that I will >!have already committed suicide by then!<. I've also started high school, and I slowly feel more and more stressed everyday whenever I get deadnamed/misgendered. It had gotten to the point where one of my classmates questioning if I \"was okay\".\n\nI am scared of telling any of this to my parents, because I feel like they will only get angry at me for feeling bad all of a sudden over stuff we've already discussed about even though there's so much new stuff to talk about. I feel like nobody supports me. Please help. I don't know if I can keep going for any longer. Am I going too fast? Do I have a valid reason for being worried for my life? A completely different taking over my thoughts??",

I am trying very hard to understand and do things right. My daughter is male to female transgender. She called me last year and said she had something to tell me and told me that she was transgender. I always knew something was up. I assume she was gay. I had no issues with this. She wanted to move home so I immediately began finding doctors for hormones and counselors Where I get confused is that she never showed any signs of being even remotely feminine growing up this was a child who played Xbox games and had Nerf swords and would role-play fighting and all kinds of things. She also had several relationships during high school with females one of which last of the year. It’s those things that confuse me. I feel like I should’ve seen some semblance of her being feminine. She even dead lifted all through high school and was dead lifting 540 pounds at 5’4” tall I want her to do what she needs to do for herself to be happy but I still get confused and in my head, any help greatly appreciated. At this point I have gotten her on her hormones and she has been going through that process a year. I have helped her get her first letter for her bottom surgery and have listed the services of Dr. Bowers, which she feels most comfortable with. I am trying my best, but as I said, I still get in my head about how she was as a child acting very like a normal boy.\nThank you so much to those of you who are being positive and helping me learn . \nPlease refrain from sending negative messages . I am getting some really nasty messages from people telling me that me and my daughter both need therapy.. this is not the case I will help my daughter through this process anyway I can end of story.",

    "selftext": "Hi all\n\nMy son is 3 and has said twice now, quite emphatically, that he wants to be a girl (like his sister, cousins etc).\nWhen I probed a bit, he said he wanted to do dress ups, be a flower girl (he and his sister were recently in a wedding party) and be a mummy.\n\nWhat’s the best way to approach this? So far I have said if he wants to be a girl it’s a decision for him to make when he’s older, that I would love him even if he were a girl, and he can do those things that he wants to do (except for being a mummy because he’s too little).\nI try really hard to be a trans ally, but having very few real life trans interactions, I feel a bit out of my depth.\n\nAdded to this, we are deeply religious. Our religion is accepting of trans people and our country allows legal sex changing. \nHowever my husband is from a very conservative culture. When I mentioned what my son had said he was immediately defensive. He would never encourage our son to be himself if he wanted to be a girl. When our son reaches adulthood he will accept any decisions he makes, but up to that point would not allow any medical procedures/treatment. He would be upset about it I think. He tries hard not to be judgemental but he very much is.\n\nI am on the fence. I’m not sure what age people can make life altering decisions. I tell people to wait until they are in their mid-20s to get married, because we change so much while our frontal lobes are developing, and I personally got married too young. \nBut then again I know that puberty can be a really hard and alienating experience for trans people who are unable to live the way they feel.\n\nSo I guess balancing all this, how do I talk to my son about this? It could be usual 3-year old behaviour, wanting something and not understanding that they can’t have it immediately (this is a frequent conversation with him atm). \n\nBut if he is trans I want to be as supportive as possible, while making sure he doesn’t do anything he might regret.\n\nPlease help, and apologies if anything I’ve said is offensive or inaccurate - please correct me. Thank you.\n\nEdit- not that I expected anything less (the trans community has a very positive rep in my country), but I’m overwhelmed by your advice and well wishes for my child and family. Thank you everyone for sharing your responses, particularly when your own experiences have sometimes been so traumatic. I know some of it seems so straightforward and obvious but your comments have been really helpful, so thank you 🙏🏼 \n\nUpdate - I checked with child and they asked to be called my big girl (because we usually call them our big boy). I said they can be a mummy if they want when they grow up, and can wear dresses. I asked if they want me to do anything else and they said “buy me lollipops on your next trip” 😂\nAlso re. pronouns - we are a bilingual household and one of the languages doesn’t use gendered pronouns so using the right gendered pronouns isn’t really a thing in our house (for example, my child will use English pronouns interchangeably because in our other language there is no difference) so that’s not something we need to cover yet I think - maybe when they start school.\nThank you again for all your kindness, empathy, help, advice and recommendations. I will join the cis parent trans kid sub for future questions x",

    "selftext": "Hi. I'm a bearded, fat, cranky old man from Maine. Dad to two amazing kids. \n\nA couple of years back, our youngest (she was 7ish at the time) shook us awake at like 1am  and told us she was a girl. I told her that I didn't care what she was as long as she was a kind person, I would always love and support her. Her big brother was great and had no problem switching pronouns. I had a small amount of trouble remembering, but the liberal application of a squirt gun when I messed up helped. And she had a blast. We told her that if we had known she was a girl at the time of her birth, she was gonna be named Parker, and asked if she wanted to change her name. She said no. \n\nWe had some family members get shitty. But my wife and I read them the riot act. And added some bits about the raining of hellfire and brimstone. But other than that her pronoun transition went smoothly. It also helped that we were homeschooling at the time.\n\nAs a side note, my ancient neighbor, an old Mainer with the thick Maine accent didn't bat an eye when we told him. He only replied, \"Well I had a brother that was gay, so none of that shit bothers me. I'll do my best to get it right.\" Which just goes to show you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. In that moment I decided it would be counter productive to try to explain trans...I just took the win.\n\nShe's 10 now and we started her in public school. We're two weeks in, and now she wants to change her name. Which I am all for, but I wish she had done it before school starts. We live in a rural state, in a ruraler (not a word but should be) town, and I'm worried about her. We have been shielding her from the reality that there are people who will hate her for being her best self. I am ashamed to say that I suggest she hold off on changing her name. I'm just so scared. \n\nBut today she went to school and told her teacher and guidance counselor she was changing her name. And I was so proud of her, and ashamed all over again. Her face radiates a pure joy when I use her new name. It reminds me of how she was when we started using she/her. \n\nI guess the question I am asking is; How can I better support her? How can I get past my fear? How can I let this piece of my heart that walks free in the world be her best self if I'm so scared?\n\nEdit. Thank everyone for the words of encouragement. It means a lot. I have some childhood trauma that makes me always feel like I'm not good enough at anything. Not good for anyone. And I spend a lot of time worrying that I'm gonna fuck up my kids. \n\nFinal edit. Good gods. The support from you all is great! Thank you so much. I've been reading all the comments, even if I haven't responded to everyone. I wish I could be a dad to all the kids who need one. I didn't have a dad, not a good one at any rate. I think I'm an OK dad, but I'm getting better all the time, thanks to my partner and two amazing kids. \n\nI hope all of you find the family, blood or not, that you need. I hope all of you find peace. \n\nI'll leave you with two favorite quotes of mine:\n\n\"There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part! You can't even passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus -- and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it -- that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!!\" ~Mario Savio\n\n\"The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.\" ~Antonio Gramsci",

    "selftext": "Good morning,\n\nI am a 20 year old, Cis man from England and I work  in a bar (This is a throw away account.) Last shift I had a lady who looked a bit young order a vodka + soda, so I asked for her ID and when she showed it to me she was of legal age and it was a real ID. The issue was, and I am making a presumption here but this to me seems like a reasonable assumption given the circumstance, the ID looked like from before she transitioned.\n\nHer ID had a masculine name, and the picture was off someone masculine presenting (If that's the right terminology, apologies other wise) but there were some overt tell tale signs it was the same person like how her eyes and nose looked and some other stuff. But at the same time , obviously she didn't really look like the photo? But I didn't for a second think she was using someone else's ID because you'd be stupid as a woman to hand over a mans ID (well, I mean an ID which says your a man if you get me) so I let her have the drink. (It was also an edge case where 99%  sure over 18, but we enforce challenge 25)\n\nObviously, in the future i'd like to handle this situation with more confidence . (Not only to save the customer from a potentially embarrassing situation but also, I dont want to lose my job LMAO)  . Usually, if i'm unsure about ID I ask the name and DOB but that felt inappropriate cause like your not meant to bring up someone's old name. Maybe she kept the same name but it was a masculine name so I didn't risk it?\n\nAnyways, apologies for the ramble I just wanted to add some context.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight from your side about how this situation plays out? Would I be out of pocket asking for the name?  I'm just worried that I might ruins someone's night if this happens again if they look like COMPLETELY different from the ID photo so I can't even try and let it slide. I also don't want to ruin someone's night by making them uncomfortable. So I just thought i'd ask and see what the vibes were? Thank you!\n\n\\*\\*EDITED : Grammar mistakes",

I was telling one of my friends about how good my night was, and how we went down on eachother (im in college so i do kiss and tell to my close friends) and she says, “wait, you ate pussy?” And i was like “well no” because thats not REALLY what i did, i kinda just gave head like i would to any other guy. \n\nShe was telling me that she believed that i thought i was straight, but i wasn’t actually straight. I said i would never be with a girl as im not attracted to women. She said “would you be with a masculine lesbian” and i said “no” and she says, “is that not what (my partners name) is? Its really annoying because my partner is a MAN. \n\nthis girl isnt outright disrespectful or rude, but for some reason does not see this guy as a man like i do. We havent known him pre transition and its really annoying for his gender and my sexuality to not be valid to her. She doesn’t have a problem with me seeing this guy, she just, doesnt see him as a guy. She doesnt misgender him (i mean she uses the correct name and pronouns) but i just dont understand why she doesnt treat him like if i was seeing anyone else. \n\nI know theres not much i can do here, im just wondering if anyone has any tips on trying to change her mind? Or should i not even bother",

    "selftext": "I’m a 22 year old dude with a long history of experimenting with random substances out of curiosity. A few years ago, I purchased a load of estradiol and bicalutamide online (I believe from aphrodite? Something like that), and took 50mg oral bica and 2mg sublingual E for 2 weeks. The idea had always intrigued me - how much of the emotional effects of sex hormones are real and how much is stereotyping? What does it feel like to have the wrong sex hormones in your body? \n\nI was a little taken aback by how quickly the emotional affects started to set in - after a week or so I started to feel much more emotionally open, even uncontrollably tearing up at a few things that I normally would never react to. Feelings of anger and anxiety also diminished by like 90%, but I also felt like I had lower energy. There was also a subtle sort of vibe shift in my consciousness in general, I can only describe it as feeling like a kid again. Makes sense I guess, with there being way less test in my body, like how it was as a kid.\n\nEventually though I had to pull the plug on the experiment, after about 2 weeks. TMI, but my dick went completely dead and my libido was pretty much nonexistent, which kind of scared me. Also my nipples had become noticeably puffy and prominent. It felt good asf to touch them though ngl.\n\nIt’s been almost 3 years now and I’ve decided to revisit the experience, and I’m now on day 3 of 50mg bica and 4mg E (maybe the potency declined so I upped the dose). I think the shift in worldview hrt gave me was actually pretty cool tbh, I view it in a similar way to shrooms or some other psychedelic. It’s just nice to shake up your brain chemistry every once in a while.\n\nAm I stupid for doing this? I think it might become a once or twice yearly thing where I just chill out and take HRT for a couple weeks. Are there any serious long term effects I should be worried about doing it this way?",

I had my vaginoplasty done in April of 2023. Dr Bradley Erickson left me with what amounts to a meat canyon with vaguely vagina features at the bottom. No joke my outer lips are nearly 3 inches deep before you get to what barely passes as inner labia. I had infections which he ignored for 9 months before I finally fired him from my care team. I brought up my infection in 7 different appointments with him. I went to obgyn 2 weeks later. By then the infection was so bad that when I expressed that I had an infection, the obgyn doctor told me she didn’t need me to tell her that, as she could smell it across the room. She told me this to reassure me that my concern was valid and that Dr Bradley Erickson was in fact wrong to ignore my infection. I can’t even pee right because this imbecile put my urethra underneath my inner labia, which he also fucked up, my inner labia is just a tight o ring of flesh. The fuck up with the urethra is so bad, that as a woman with a vagina, I pee on the floor while sitting on the toilet. I have to pee folded over with my belly touching the toilet seat to avoid peeing on the floor. It’s that bad, and no, none of this is an exaggeration. This is all genuinely this bad.\n\nI need to know, can I seek recompense for his fuck up and negligence? Can I seek to have my insurance pay for reconstruction of the vagina due how horrendously hideous it is, and that it looks nothing like a vagina? Does anyone know a lawyer that might take my case? My insurance has already told me they will pay to have the urine issue fixed as well as the cause of the infections fixed. Thankfully I finally know what is causing the infections and can manage it until a more permanent resolution can be reached.\n\nA last note to any trans women in Iowa, I know Dr Bradley Erickson is the only surgeon in Iowa that performs vaginoplasty. It’s not worth it. Go somewhere else. Do NOT let him do to you what he did to me. It’s not worth the pain, the mental trauma, the misery, and embarrassment. No matter how much longer it takes to go somewhere else, do so. Don’t let him do this to you.",

She's gender-fluid, is this a known thing at all with gender-fluid kids?  \n  \n  \nThe details:  \nMy daughter started occasionally asking us to use she/her pronouns at the age of 5. We would do this on the day she asked for it, but not carry on through the next day (this was in 2020, so we had a lot on our minds! And she was so little, we didn't want to make big assumptions.)  \n  \nShe has known our gay and trans friends and coworkers her whole life and we have always supported her interests and self-expression and deliberately broken down gender barriers to things like wearing pink and having long hair, playing with dolls (she also loved dinosaurs and cars, and cut her own hair at 5 so she'd look like her male cousins).\n\nTwo years ago, at age 8, she came home from school with her Gender Unicorn worksheet and told us she had introduced herself as a girl to her class that day in a round robin, and she wanted us to switch to she/her pronouns, which we did immediately.  A month later she wanted a female name and we helped her choose a feminine variation from her middle name, which we switched to and have established at school, the doctor, the community center, and our faith community.\n\nOh and I should mention she's autistic, she has a formal medical diagnosis. I know that gender variance is about 6 times more common in autistic kids.\n\nOver time she's discerned that she identifies as gender-fluid. She feels like a girl most of the time, but briefly a boy at certain times (when she's peeing, pooping, wrestling with Daddy, or eating meat).  I would find it very distressing to feel my gender changing on me like that, so I asked more questions. She's totally cool with it.\n\nWe had always made a point of being gender-neutral (referring to her as \"our child\" for example) but after she came out to us we've made a point of referring to her as \"our daughter\" and \"our little girl\". We re-introduced her to friends and community with the new name, and I leaned in to getting her feminine clothes and buying her some pretty dresses, which she loves.\n\nOne thing I messed up on is I told her a bit too much of what it is like being a woman in the world--I was a little freaked out that I had thought I was raising a son and I had tailored my information accordingly: that he needed to be an ally. I hadn't prepared her for . . . being a target.  Not being as safe in the world. So we have a lot of gender discussions, and I described the generalities of the street harassment I've experienced. Nothing overblown or traumatic but it made a big impact on her. \n\nShe also has been pretty freaked out that when she's wearing a dress, strangers will walk up to us in stores and parking lots and tell her how pretty she is. She hides behind me. At first I didn't even think about it because the same thing happened to me as a kid and I encouraged her to make eye contact and use words, etc, like I do in normal social interactions with people we know and at the store and library and so on--practicing social skills she struggles with.   \nBut she told me how uncomfortable it makes her, and it suddenly dawned on me how deeply weird it is as a culture that we do this, and how she's not used to it because she was a boy for the first 8 years and it never happened to her then. So we agreed that she doesn't have to engage or respond to strangers who approach to compliment her looks, I handle it all.\n\nWe've had several conversations this summer about how she wants to grow up to be a man. She wishes she could have a baby when she grows up but knows surgery can't make that possible.  She wants to marry a woman one day and have a family (we reminded her about our lesbian friends and how girls can marry girls and how two other kids in her class changed gender the same year she did, it's very common).  \n  \nShe has cited her fear of being hit on as part of it, though recently she's been saying that \"that's why we're voting for Kamala Harris, she'll fix that.\"  Usually I clarify such things, but since I want her not to have anxiety about this and it's my fault she's worrying about it, I've leaned into this and agreed.\n\nToday she got home from sleepaway camp (her first time in a girls' cabin) and I was washing her hair.  I noticed a paper bracelet (like for concerts or swimming) on her wrist and asked about it, and it's how the camp tags kids whose photos can't be used for promo.    \n  \nShe asked me why I'd chosen that and I reminded her that my family doesn't know she's trans (she has same-age cousins who we love, who are being raised in a rigidly fundamentalist household. If we share her new name and pronouns, my sibling and parents will force the children to misgender her, I'd have to issue an ultimatum, and we'd lose contact. So she isn't out to them. This is a collaboration between us, and I check in with her a lot. Our contact with them is limited, I never leave her alone with them, and I bring meat snacks because that helps her feel like a boy while she's around them) and I don't want any photos out there that could reveal her gender to them or possibly more broadly compromise her safety (like under a second Trump administration, although the fear of that is receding for us).\n\nI took the opportunity to ask about the man thing again.\n\nIn these conversations about gender logistics, my main goal has been to make sure she's aware of the existence of blockers--that she's not trapped in her body and that if she begins to experience gender dysphoria at puberty onset she should come to us right away. And making sure she fully understands both male and female puberty changes.\n\nAt first I thought the \"grow up to be a man\" thing was about social fears.\n\nI'm trying so hard to be present for her at her developmental speed and be a good ally, but it's so much stumbling and guessing. I'm trying to listen and understand and not press too much and give her the right information.\n\nTonight I told her (with her father in the room nodding and agreeing, he's 100% on board) that I'd absolutely support whatever she decides, but that it is so important to be herself--that she should only decide to grow up to be a man if that is what she feels like inside.\n\nShe said very firmly that she feels like when she's older she'll be a man.  And we said we will support that.\n\nI . . . used to want this? A little bit. Just because I want my kid to be safe and I want her to be able to have children easily (she's always loved babies and talked about wanting to have children one day when she's grown).  None of us want our children's lives to be more difficult or dangerous.\n\nBut I had let that go and fully adjusted and now I'm just confused! I'm worried I'm not supporting her right and she doesn't feel safe enough to be herself in the world as she grows. \n\nI asked her about the \"our little girl\" and \"daughter\" stuff and the dresses and cute feminine tops and all that, if she still wants me to lean into that. She said yes, emphatically.\n\nI said, \"So okay, you think that eventually when you are far enough into puberty, you'll switch back to your old name (we'd discussed this previously, it's part of her plan), and we'll switch back to he/him pronouns--or you might use they/them?\"\n\nShe said yes, but that she'd like us, her parents, to keep using she/her, that it will be a happy reminder of her childhood, which smote me to the heart. We said sure. And she said she'll probably still wear dresses sometimes, and we agreed that was fine.\n\nIs this. . . a thing? A kid planning like this for years in the future. Is it likely to hold? I'm starting to feel convinced it will because she's been pretty steady on it for a little while now. But I'm worried about fully accepting it--I don't want her to feel trapped by this, to do it because she thinks it will please us or feels like we expect it. But I also want to trust her.\n\nIs there a name for this? I told her I'd never heard of it, but that there might well be other kids who felt the same, and it would certainly make sense that an autistic kid would be the one to do it.  And that the only thing that mattered was her outside matching how she feels inside.  \n  \nIf anything I'd heard that autistic kids with gender variance are more likely to have a gender change be permanent. But this isn't lining up with anything in any of the books I read.\n\nI'm just befuddled. I'm autistic too, so having a framework for understanding what is going on here would really help me. I'm trying to go with the flow but that's definitely not my skill set.",

They look horrified with the idea that HRT can make trans folks infertile. They try to spin it like it's a bad thing and act like we didn't know. They'll make comments about how it's wrong to take hrt because it can make us infertile. I've even seen a man cry when that aspect of hrt was brought up. I've had family try to talk  me into detransitioning because it will make me unable to continue the family line. \nI genuinely don't get it. \nI have never wanted kids and wanted to eliminate the ability to have children so maybe I just don't am missing a part of the puzzle.\n",

More bathroom space available to everyone, inclusive as shit, floor to ceiling doors, largish stalls, and other stuff im probably forgetting.

Thanks for the clarification everyone! \n\n\nThere was a cis dude who approached me at school trying his best to shoot his shot at me. I am a straight Trans man so I apologised and turned him down but he said that its not gay for me to go out with him because technically I am biologically female and he is biologically male so it is not gay. He respects the fact that I am trans and treats me like a man. He said that technically my brain is a male brain trapped in a female body and so because it is a female body its not gay for him to date me. I was like but I am still a dude and if he likes me, he likes a man and a man liking a man is gay. So we both just sat there and did some mental gymnastics about if a Cis man and a Trans man going out together is gay. Both of use are really confused lol.

    "selftext": "My daughter is 10, and in October of last year, she let us know she was trans, and was actually a girl. She's a happy, well adjusted kid with a naturally sunny disposition, and coming out as trans has basically been all positive for her. Her friends have completely accepted her, no issues at school and while my wife is a natural worrier and so is worried about this, we've fully accepted her at home and support her.\n\nI think when she was younger, she struggled with being a boy because she was very unathletic, uncoordinated and generally hated sports. She was also the smallest kid in her class despite also being the oldest. Being able to ditch any gendered expectations that come with being a boy has been really good for her.\n\nShe has started seeing a psychiatrist regularly, who specializes in child gender issues, and is very open with me and her mom. She also reads a ton and is extremely bright, so when the psychiatrist recommended she read some books about being a trans woman, she read them and then asked for more. So she's fairly knowledgeable about what being a trans girl means, and has a fairly good idea (for a 10 year old) of what puberty is and how her body will naturally change as she gets older.\n\nBut what sort of confuses me is that she has expressed a desire to not transition. She doesn't want to delay puberty, and she's said that when she's older, she's not going to take hormones or get any surgery done. My wife and I are 100% ok with not doing anything medical, and in fact, my wife is terrified of her physically transitioning. She's very worried that my daughter will outgrow being trans, and that we might get to irreversible changes or other traumatic issues if she moves too quickly.\n\nMy worry is the opposite. If she's a girl, but has a more and more \"male\" body, she might start experience gender dysphoria, because while she might be ok with it now, how will she feel in a decade about being a woman with an 20 year old male's body? I certainly don't want to push her or anything, but I am worried that she can't really understand what it's going to be like as an adult.\n\nAny advice? Anyone who has been in the same or similar situations?",

This is a really long post because I provide a lot of context but I would appreciate all the support and feedback you guys can give. I’m also posting this in multiple communities to reach more audiences because I’m struggling.\n\nContext: I am a cis pansexual female dating my trans boyfriend. I will also be switching between he/they for my boyfriend because they want to be referred to as both equally.\n\nMy boyfriend uses he/they pronouns and I used she/they pronouns. He told me that he is uncomfortable with me using they in my pronoun set and wants me to remove it and use she/her pronouns. Their reasoning was that they felt uncomfortable with me using she/they since he considers they/them pronouns as gender affirming with gender identity and I don’t identify as nonbinary or genderqueer. \n\nThey felt that as a trans and nonbinary individual wanting to be referred to as he/they equally, that my use of they would confuse people who might think I’m doing it for the same reason when I’m not. They thought it felt presentative and like appropriation rather than support. He also felt like my use of they/them pronouns diminishes his experience as a more gender fluid trans man. \n\nFurthermore, he like it was wrong for me to use they/them pronouns since he feels I previously had damaging beliefs about the trans community which I can give more context on at the bottom of this post.\n\n——\n\nI told them that I felt like that was unfair for them to ask me to change my pronouns because they should be a personal choice based on what a person feels comfortable being referred to as and shouldn’t be determined by what other people think they should use. \n\nI use they in my pronoun set since I define it as a gender neutral term that isn’t exclusive solely to genderqueer or nonbinary people. I include they because I’m comfortable with being seen as both and I also want to show my allyship and normalize the term. \n\nI also don’t like the idea of being restricted solely to she/her pronouns and have been using she/they pronouns for several years. While I do identify as female, sometimes I also feel masculine in some ways and in my expression and I don’t want to be seen as completely feminine. \n\nIt is true that I’m not nonbinary or genderfluid but I have read other discussion forums about whether cis people can use they/them pronouns and all of them have said yes with similar reasons that I listed above. Many people also mentioned that pronouns do not equal gender.\n\nWe had a long conversation about this and I told them I was willing to change my pronouns because it bothers them but I still feel sad like I’m being told to take away a part of myself. I feel like he’s struggling with a lot of insecurities as a trans nonbinary individual that he’s inflicting onto me. Am I wrong for feeling this way and what should I do next? Should I just change my pronouns to make him more comfortable or are my reasons for wanting to use she/they valid?\n\nDamaging beliefs context: In a past conversation, I told him about my family and their opinion about trans women in sports being dangerous for cis women. I told him that I could see both sides of how trans people want to be included in their gender affirming sports and how it can also affect cis women, especially in physical sports with trans women who are still in the early stages of their transition. \n\nI said this because I try to understand every perspective in every topic, even if I don’t agree with both and agree with one or the other. My sister also had a personal experience where she played rugby with a transgender woman and told me she felt like they were a lot stronger than cis women which she felt like was unfair. But I never told him I agreed with my family’s transphobic comments. Even though I “SEE” both sides meaning I have considered the justification and reasoning of both sides, I don’t agree with my family’s perspective and I side with trans women who want to be in women’s sports.\n\nFor clarification, I do believe trans people should be allowed to participate in the sports that aligns with their gender identity. However, he took my statement of seeing both sides as transphobic and this is what he is referring to when he mentioned my past damaging beliefs.",

    "selftext": " Today I decided to hang out my sister to both humor her and try reconnecting with her in some meaningful way (due to me generally being distant from her and most of my family due to their ignorance and downright transphobia toward me). For a bit, I felt comfortable with her and I thought I might be able to actually open up with her later, but right when got over to her apartment (where she lives with her husband and child) I immediately felt a sense of dread and almost horror as I saw a big Trump 2024: Take Back America flag hanging on the window inside.\n\nIt completely doured how much potential I saw for their to still be a chance to bridge the gap between my sister and finally find an ally in my family somehow. It also didn't help that the first thing I saw when I got their was her husband playing Call of Duty on his PS5 and then (a bit later) some yelling at his kid for getting a bit too excited to see me their and acting too hyper (he's a very actively hyper kid overall). \n\nAll of this is to say, I don't really know what to do. My sister asked me if I was alright at certain points due to me phasing out, and I just told her I was alright. They weren't hateful towards me (neither her or her husband), nor did they seem to draw attention to it or bring it up in any way. I even tried taking a picture to show to one of my friends, which my sister seemed to catch, and she seemed to have no real idea what I was doing. I'm really confused as to what I can do here, since on the one hand we still had fun today, but she clearly still sees me as her brother (not bothering to even follow-up on any previous vein attempt to try to improve on our relationship through this divide). \n\nI think the most important question from all of this is if should bring this up to her or not.",

    "selftext": "So today was my (21 Mtf)21st Birthday and my family decided to throw a small cocktail party at my grandma's house. So to start, three minutes in I was misgendered twice. Not a great start, so i decided to go get some fresh air by myself. My older sibling followed me and we talked for a bit. He then proceeded to ask \"so does your Dick still work\". I tried laughing it off but still pretty messed up. After this i went back to the main group and socialized a bit, and got misgendered even more by my grandma. At this point i decided to try and explain how much it hurts to hear stuff like that. She tried to defend herself by saying \"I've only know you by x all these year\", \"it's not that easy to remember\", and \"i'm sure if I changed my name out of the blue it would be difficult for you too\" (for some context I have been going by my current name for around 5 years or so now so not out of the blue). After this though she said she would try harder, then not even a half hour later proceeds to do it 6 more times in a row. Then on the drive home with my mom, after holding everything in, I broke down in tears and told my mom how i was feeling. She knew everything that happened, and said I was being \"melodramatic\", and \"overly sensative\". So the question is, was i? \n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind comments, i appreciate every comment i received. Update on the situation. This morning my mom said I should apologize for my behavior last night (I'm assuming she means be going to get some fresh air, or trying to talk to my grandma about constantly misgendering me). As well as the fact that I have 6 months to find somewhere else to live. I don't know if it was because of last night or not but this really doesn't help my current situation. ",

I wanted to celebrate by announcing it to an online group but have gotten comments like \"eh, congrats either way\". It took me over 3 years and sacrificing my finances to get this procedure, so wtf? I guess people don't see post-bottom surgery trans people as 'real trans' anymore. I stuck around in these groups because I wanted to share knowledge and give tips on how to navigate insurance and medical gatekeeping (which I have intensive experience with and I also work in healthcare administration) but it looks like nobody needs my advice, after all. \n\nSo I'm at the dilemma as a binary transman, where I've lost my trans status, because I guess I just blend with with the cis now? 🤷‍♂️\n\nI've dealt with so much reverse-transmedicalism for wanting phallo for so long, I'm convinced that truescum are made by this unspoken issue in trans communities. Basically, if I was a more reactionary and unempathic person, I can totally see myself becoming a toxic transmedicalist. It's the truth.\n\nAnyhow, this is my last post here in this this subreddit.

She’s also a POC and seems to be EXTRA hard on white trans women. Like to the point where she says she feels ashamed and embarrassed of being trans sometimes. \n\nShe has very few friends, and keeps lamenting about how she wants to feel like she’s a part of a community but when I try to take her to any queer events she assumes the worst out of everyone there. I’m almost afraid of introducing her to my other queer friends and my other trans friends. \n\nAlso found out yesterday she listens to some alarming misogynistic podcasts and seems to enjoy the rhetoric of people who are notoriously homophobic and transphobic. \n\nI’ve only been dating her for a week officially. Talking to her for 2 months. This information all came out recently. I’m getting a little worried about how she views me and other people. I do really like her. We get along very well and I feel pretty safe around her. But I’m worried about some of these deep internalized issues and views getting in the way of us being closer. \n\nDo I Run? Is there a reason she’s alienating herself from connecting with people that I as a cis white person don’t get? Can I help her in some way or should I just get out?\n\n[EDIT: First I would like to thank everyone for their insight so far!! It’s been very interesting and I have been learning some new things. I have a lot to think about. I would like to keep learning! \n\nSecond I’m sorry if the terminology used in this post made anyone uncomfortable such as (doll or fully transitioned)  I was mostly mimicking terms she uses, but I know everyone’s comfort level with them is different now\n\nThird I said she was a POC but I guess specifically saying shes mixed Brazilian/white might also add some clarity]",

Please understand that I am very open minded and accepting of all individuals and what they feel/who they are. \nMy(25F) friend Taylor 29F2M after 10 years has decided to detransition, I’m proud of them regardless. I believe it takes more courage to detransition than to transition but maybe I’m wrong. I remember when they first started taking T, it reminded me of my brother going through puberty lol but they got through the storm of the ridiculous social shame and physical transition This was the happiest I’ve ever seen them, ever. They’ve lived a stronger more lively life since growing into who they are. I’ve also learned and come to understand/acknowledge and have such an appreciation for the trans community/LGBTQIA community and culture. \nWhen I first heard the news about them wanting to detransition I was truly shocked, confused and actually a little sad because I have grown to love them as the way wanted to be loved for 10 years. They say they have found the lord and they are meant to be female as they were born. My head hurts. Freedom of religion, yes. But i don’t understand why. “I found Christ” just doesn’t answer the question. I don’t think this is something that can just happen overnight. All the nights of them crying because of acceptance, all the Testosterone you’ve put into your body, the love you shared, the life you lived. Taylor. I feel like I’m losing a friend. Like I just don’t know who they are anymore. \n\nTldr:im coming to Reddit because I don’t understand and I want to understand the thought process behind detransitioning. Please help. I’m heartbroken but this post isn’t about me. ",

He gets visibly upset when someone calls him a girl and insists he is a boy, often correcting people who use the wrong pronouns.

While I do not encourage people forcing people to like someone with a certain part, this has come off as... a way of excluding transgender people from the lesbian community since many people glorify this statement while being attracted to exclusively non-men. There are many different perspectives I've seen from different people like they don't mind dating people with a penis, or they prefer not to which is totally okay! But to me, I feel like putting the statement \"I hate [insert physical part here]\" out there so much that it almost is percieved as a part of the lesbian label is wrong because some people in the lesbian community, including trans lesbians just don't feel that way.\nI wanted to ask how people in the trans community feel about this and whether or not it should be considered offensive because I care about being inclusive to everyone and not offending anyone.

    "selftext": "First: I am a cis-gendered woman. I am writing here because I want a trans person's view on this, but cis-people can also comment.\n\nI work as a teacher. At my school we have had a couple of trans students, but not that many. My coworker/friend is twenty years older than me, but we've always had a good relationship. She doesn't know that much about the trans community and trans people, but she is accepting of our trans students. She seems to be an open-minded person who respects others, or at least she has in the past.\n\nOne thing we haven't been able to discuss properly is JK Rowling. My coworker has always loved Harry Potter. I did too as a kid, but in my 20s I discovered she was transphobic. I tried to ignore it at first, but through listening to trans YouTubers that I admired, I had to admit that it was true. However, my coworker never really took me seriously when I said I disliked JK Rowling. She would listen to me rant, but she would say things like \"Well, I'm too busy to get invested in this stuff\" and she wouldn't let me send her some reliable sources. But one time she told me she had talked to a friend of hers in England, someone her own age (50s), and this person had said Rowling was being treated \"unfairly\" and she was \"misunderstood\". It annoyed me that she would so readily listen to this other person but not me.\n\nAnyway, today the topic came up again. She has in the past divided her class into \"Hogwarts houses\" (teams) and given them points that they collect through the year. I told her that if we're doing a two-teacher system together next year, I don't want to use Hogwarts houses. She said that was fine. When I mentioned anything Harry Potter and Rowling just gets me in a bad mood, she said \"I think she is just very pro-women.\" I said something like \"No, she is not\", but I dropped it. Okay... I might have muttered some stuff about Rowling, but I didn't want to argue. But I was upset, and I was mostly upset about what she said.\n\nI was upset because saying that Rowling is just \"very pro-women\" implies cis-women only. In my opinion, a person who is truly pro-women is pro all women. And anyone who knows anything about Rowling and her \"feminism\" knows she does not accept trans people's gender identity, she sees trans' rights as an attack on women and the youth, and she and her terf-pals are notorious for misgendering trans-women online and trying to make the trans community look bad. My coworker should know better than to say she is \"pro-women\".\n\nI have to say, my coworker is not very educated on trans people or the community. Uneducated people will make mistakes, but at the same time, she is not making an effort to understand my point of view. She hasn't made an effort to look into what Rowling is saying, even after being told multiple times how awful she is. I just feel like what she said was very insensitive, but I don't think she even considered that. I don't think she has a clue that she might have said something upsetting.\n\nCan you guys share your thoughts on this? Am I misinterpreting what she said? I don't think I am. I know I am upset on behalf of a community that I am not apart of, and I would like to hear a trans person's point of view.\n\n**Update:**\n\n* Today she started asking students what they thought of the houses. They said it was good, but my interpretation was that they just liked teams. She was convinced they liked houses. She suggested maybe her doing the houses and not me if we worked together, however, later she said maybe it wasn't such a good idea because nobody ever wanted to be a Hufflepuff or Slytherin (even if they did an online test to get sorted). I feel like she is steering away from the houses because she can tell how pissed it makes me, but she won't acceåt the underlying cause.\n* I tried to casually mention some nasty Tweets JK had posted. She didn't say anything. She used a diversion tactic and started asking me about something else. She just doesn't get it, and she clearly doesn't want to talk about it. I think she agreed not to use the houses because she doesn't want to have this discussion with me.",

I recently found out which residence building I’m staying in and that I will have a randomly assigned roommate (I will get her contact information later in the summer). My mom is very stressed out about me starting university in general and her latest worry is that I have to disclose to my roommates I’m trans.\n\nMy mom thinks it would be best for me to mention it in my first email to my roommate right when I get her contact information and gauge her reaction. That way there are no surprises and if there is an issue I can request another roommate. I see where she is coming from but I find that idea very embarrassing. I don’t want this girl’s first impression of me to be that I’m trans. I don’t want to scare her or her family. And even if she was accepting I don’t want to be “the trans roommate” or “the trans friend” instead as seen as an individual. \n\nFor context, I transitioned socially when I was 10. I was put on puberty blockers that prevented me from going through male puberty. Unless you they were told or saw me fully naked no one would assume I’m trans. I was in grade 5 when I first transitioned so everyone at my elementary school (kindergarten through grade 8) knew. I was bullied and it caused a big controversy with the parents when I was allowed to use the girls bathroom. I went to a different high school than the other people from my elementary school so I could only tell people I trusted/was friends with. This went well for the most part and I wasn’t bullied but it also caused me a lot of stress about whether or not people would find out. \n\nMy mom and I have been arguing back and forth about the roommate thing for the past few days. She says she’s scared that the roommate will somehow accidentally find out and it will lead to a bad or even dangerous situation. I don’t really foresee that happening.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? In your honest opinion do you think it would be better to tell my roommate right away or is it ok to just not tell her? \n",

I have had many older adults call me a man and have even had people in public debate what my gender/sex might be. As a cis person I obviously cannot experience dysphoria but sometimes I feel whatever the equivalent of that might be. For context I am wasian, I have smaller eyes but a very long and broad/angular face.  I also have a  longer and hooked nose. I have broader shoulders and narrow hips. I also have very small breasts that disappear under most clothes. I can understand why people would be confused or assume I am a trans woman honestly. I have come to ask trans women specifically on how they deal with people being transphobic to them in public, because every time something like that happens to me I end up crying and my self perception is ruined for a long time. If anyone has facial or body feminizing tips that would be great too! Anything from makeup, hair, clothing, or even facial feminization would be helpful! I would ask cis women for advice but I'm not sure all cis women can relate to my experience.\n\n&#x200B;",

And I've found it's usually a fairly liberal, progressive but middle-class thing\n\nI have seen many examples but here's one, I read that the erogenous zone for \"people with penises\" is mostly between their legs but for \"people with vulvas/vaginas\" it's all over the body. Which is true for cis men and women. But trans men on T mostly will experience the former and trans women on E will mostly experience the latter. Even if they haven't had lower surgery yet.\n\nAnd it doesn't bother me that they only mean cis people. If they said \"this is for cis people\" then it wouldn't matter to me. But saying that this information\" is true of all bodies is false.\n\nSimilar examples are when cis people forget about lower surgery. Like, many trans women have vulvas and vaginas, and many trans men have penises and balls. Obviously not all, and it's valid to not want that, but many people do. In lots of these situations, AGAB doesn't work either, especially with things which are driven by hormones. And don't even get me started with people using AMAB/AFAB to mean male/female 😖 \n\nAt the end of the day, I just want cis people - those with and without medical qualifications - to just stop talking over us with generalisations when they could just be quiet.\n\nRant over! 😂",

Unfortunately, she can't stand how I taste and dislikes going down on me. She also never finishes inside me and always needs me to give her a handjob to come. This will sound really fucking dumb (because it is) but her aversion (?) to sex acts related to my vagina makes me insecure and lowkey dysphoric. I feel like there's something dirty or wrong with me because she never derives pleasure from that part of my body. I don't know how or even if I should address this with her. I am aware her own dysphoria may play a role here. Help? \n\nEDIT: Through experience and conversation, I've reached the conclusion that she very much enjoys penetrative sex, and that her problem with finishing inside me is that it makes her dysphoric. But she does find my vagina attractive, and my boobs, so there's that. I feel oddly insecure about my female features, because she's said before that when we started dating she was only attracted to my masculine side and pretty much ignored my feminine traits, and even though that has changed now I keep feeling like there's something wrong and dirty about my body. I blame the patriarchy. Thank you everyone for your support and advice.",

As someone who has always loved and appreciated their friendships with girls, with women, who has had plenty of close and intimate relationships with women of all ages, as a worker who has chosen a field that has kept me in close proximity to women, who has served women in a front line kind of way throughout most of my working life, I know that there are precious few of us that would truthfully be considered world class beauties, no matter how we look at it or how we think about ourselves. It is what it is, and no amount of imagining will change that. The Bell Curve places most of us right in the middle of things. Not beautiful, not ugly, just who we are. Normal, everyday kinds of women.\n\nI know how women look at the crack of dawn, at the end of the day and know, from being there right alongside them, day in and day out, that most do their best to keep it pulled together, and some do it all the time, knowing that time, age, and societal expectations do a number on us all and know that there is not a damn thing we can do about it but throw money at it to try to slow it down. Most of us know that how we've lived our lives has colored our looks. Most of us know that we are never going to be Tik Tok stars, be well paid influencers, be splashed on the cover of Vogue. Most women I know make due with their looks, fret about those looks and know, without a doubt, that other women are doing the same. It is a vicious world and the more we do to back away from the false expectations of what women are supposed to look like, the better. But in so many ways we can't. It's a hardcore treadmill that we can't get off of. \n\nSome of us are just ugly old women. Can't be helped, we just arrive here at the bidding of life. I am almost 67. No way I can worry about that beauty thing. No amount of make up is going to get me a partner or land me a movie deal. Really, what is the problem folks have with us ugly old women? Afraid of your future? Girls, embrace it. In the meantime, while you are waiting to be a crone like me, cultivate self love, develop a sense of style, be courageous and learn not to care what others think about how you look.

While it's not the best place for trans people to live, it's certainly not the worst either, especially when one lives in the capital city. She was completely out at her workplace and faced no transphobia there. She didn't have to worry about funding medical or legal transition, because she could have easily afforded private healthcare. We discussed her plans many times and she mentioned what procedures she'd like to undergo. I was fully supportive and told her many times that whatever adjustments she chooses to or not to have done, I'll be by her side. I was trying to help by looking up trans-friendly specialists or apply for her legal name to be changed. I was genuinely trying my best to learn about transgender people, their problems and just support her in what I imagined must have been very hard for her. I encouraged her to talk with other transgender women to exchange experiences, pieces of advice or just talk with someone who's going through similar things.\n\nBut my beloved girlfriend never actually started the process. She used to make appointments and cancel them last minute. She would talk about the name change application for days, but she never sent it. She suffered from acute dysphoria and said on multiple occasions that she would like to have her body hair removed or have her hair professionally done, but didn't do anything to make that happen. I thought she needed time to think thoroughly. It was never my intention to rush her into anything, although I could see how much she suffered. I thought one day she'd summon up the courage to make the first step. Instead, she summoned up the courage to jump in front of a train. She left no note, no explanation but for a song titled \"I'm sorry\".\n\nAnd now we go back to the question in the title: why didn't she even try? She had supportive friends, friendly workplace, financial means, all these things many other transgender people lack. Why couldn't she at least try? Why did she give up before even going to an appointment? I don't know if it sounds like I'm blaming her, I'm really not, I'm just trying to understand. To make even a little bit of sense of what changed my life forever. \n",

    "selftext": "I am 34 years old. I am.AMAB and began taking hormones in February of this year. As far back as I can, remember, I've always liked \"girly\" things. I wanted an easy, bake oven, a kitchen set, I secretly wanted a doll houses of young child, I never liked sports, and as I got a little older, I always like to be run girls instead of boys. At age 10, unfortunately, I was molested buy my 12-year-old female cousin.  I went to therapy over this, and I did ultimately testify against her one year later in court. When I hit puberty, I hated being called a man, and still prefer to be called a boy because I felt that that was \"more innocent\" to be called a boy. Puberty was difficult. I hated growing hair under my arms, as that was seen as a masculine trait. I always thought the female voices sounded better and I didn't really like my voice as I used to sing in a choir and I couldn't hit higher notes anymore. I would play with Barbie video games, and I did eventually get a dollhouse at age 12 for a birthday. Even as an adult in my 20s, being called a man really made me upset. It wasn't until last November that a lightbulb clicked off in my head and I started to really question my gender identity. I have a lot of great support and I even attend a trans group. The reason I'm panicking right now is because I saw a video from \"Dr. Z\" and she says that you can develop gender dysphoria from being sexually abused. I feel like an imposter now and by the way, I have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria back in January of this year. And I feel stupid because I didn't figure out I was trans until I was in my 30s and so many people seem to figure out when they're just a kid. Now I feel like an imposter. I like being hormones I like being able to wear a dress and use a purse. It brings me comfort. Does anyone have any advice for me? I will link the video below.\n\n  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71HAMSEZ9Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71HAMSEZ9Q)",

Sorry I love you both, but yall are focusing on something that is going to screw up your success at UT.  I cannot go into deep debt, debt I will never get out of if yall aren't successful and can be employable.   \n\nYou dont see that ahead because again yohre young and have no life exoerience.  You just don't understand. But I'll be here to dry your tears when you turn your Iives upside down and screw up your bodies, cause your own mental anguish x10 because you focused on something thats going to take your life in different trajectory and the point of going to UT was to be success in your education. Bc if you're just going there to be a transvestite, you will fail, you will not get recommendations from your professors who are the keyholders to your success. You won't even be able to graduate without your internships. So i don't think you're thinking about how miserable you're about to make yourself and me and dad due to the incredible debt  we are signing up for in hopes of YOUR success bc we don't have the money to pay that. \n\nOK maybe we need to hold off on UT until yall figure out what yall want to do.  That's not going to workout and we can't be worrying about the debt bc you twohave not done your part signing up for scholarships.  YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN A FULL RIDE IF YOU HAD MANNED UP AND COME OUT AS GAY.  But yall haven't done anything, you won't read anything, you won't even look at UTs website to see all the things you need to know about being at school there. You won't look at housing. You won't do any of that. So I'm starting to think you really aren't interested in UT as much as you thought you were or said you were. \n\nDms open if you'd rather help there. Thx ❤️",

    "selftext": "(For those of you who didn't read my original post, I'll give you the rundown and the link to it. https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/s/KuT3vXzaKN)\nI'm a 15 year old closeted trans girl in 9th grade and here recently I trusted a teacher enough to tell them about that. Being me, I wrote two notes. One was about who I am, and the other about a Department of Education (DoE) ruling in 2019 saying that the student has the right to decide who gets told about their transgender status, and that telling someone without their permission is illegal. I gave her both notes, and told her what i just said about the DoE ruling. But instead of reading them, she called up the principal and gave him the notes, and after a long conversation between the principal and I, he decided to call my dad about all this. (No, my dad doesn't know about me being trans, or at least so far as I know.) Well they basically came to the decision that I would have a conversation with my dad about this and tell him. That was yesterday, and I made my previous post on the bus.\n\n(UPDATE)----------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter I got home, my dad had a conversation with me, and he gave me probably the greatest choice he could have in this situation. He decided to respect my privacy and let me tell him I (which I'll probably do at 18) when I want to. He also told me that the school wants him in there Monday if I didn't tell him anything so me, my dad, and the principal can talk about it. And so I did tell him some things, but I was VERY careful to not reveal myself as trans. I should note that my dad is not at all supportive of the LGBTQ community. But anyways, he also decided that he would go into the school only if I wanted him to, and obviously, I said that I would like for him NOT to. Now, there is also a conversation we had that morning where he decided that I could drop out at 16, and start studying for my GED test, or I could stay on school. Well after this, I told him I don't want to step foot in that school again. So in about 3 months, I'm going to start studying for my GED test and not have to deal with school. And as a little extra information, I want to look into legal action against the school. If anyone has any advice on that, it wo8be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nSo yeah, that's the update. I know it's not what some wanted where I telly dad and he supports me, but it did end pretty well. Thank you all for your concern.",

She was very receptive to it and explained a lot about how her body works, especially in relation to HRT.\n\nI showed her the post, and she mentioned that she feels as if no other man has cared for her this much, even in long-term relationships before. She really appreciates me for coming forward and trying.\n\nTo answer the first question from my previous post: when it comes to oral, she doesn’t want “that part of her,” as she said, to be taken care of as much. She’s completely fine with me not being comfortable doing certain things, just as she isn’t comfortable doing certain things. She did to me what she wants done to her in that area, which was truly enlightening.\n\nRegarding the second question, she explained that she does finish every time, and it’s an ambiguous thing, especially for me, since I had only previously been with cisgender women. She mentioned how she is truly satisfied and happy.\n\nNow, the thing she was happiest about was the fact that I wanted to open a conversation and looked for solutions in my own way. She mentioned how these topics are worth talking about and how much we should emphasize communication like this.\n\nLastly, as a little note to everyone who commented and tried to help—thank you. You all made me feel comfortable about how to approach her and the conversation overall. I appreciate the insight, and I hope everyone has a good rest of their night.\n\nMuch love!\n\n",

(Just FYI, I moved her out of there, so she doesn't have to face that everyday.)\n\nThough we are out, I'm still talking with them. I'm still leaving the door open for education and growth for now (unless I see they just don't want to learn; I've been able to explain the scientific basis of trans existence to one of my stepdaughters at least, and she seems eager to learn more.) But no matter what proof I've shown them, they still refuse to use her name and pronouns because 1) it's against their belief system and 2) they say they can't \"feed into the delusion\" or \"lie\" to her because they just can't wrap their heads around the idea that \"God made a mistake\" or how someone with a penis can possibly feel like a girl. \n\nI've warned all of them they are risking not having either of us in their lives anymore should they continue to not use her name, but I don't think that has really registered in their brains (or maybe it's wishful thinking, like maybe they don't want a relationship with us. That would be hard and terrible for me to swallow. I love them and don't want to lose them.) I'd like to think that if they knew how harmful it was to her, they'd stop doing it. \n\nCan I get some help explaining how harmful this is to her and how it makes her feel? I can't seem to articulate it. \n\nBTW, I'm not asking her because she has been through enough and shouldn't have to explain further about who she is. For me, if I didn't operate with patience (I remember what that indoctrination was like and that pull is so strong), and provide every opportunity for them to make it right, I wouldn't feel as if I did all I could do to help facilitate a relationship between her and her father.

Lots of anti-trans people are getting elected which is spooky. But there is some good news particularly in Canada in the last year. The good news is recent elections at the provincial level in Canada anyway show that trans hate may actually indeed be a losing issue.\n\nIn the last 13 months there will have been 5 provincial elections. In all but one, transphobia has been used as a weapon and it hasnt won the Conservatives an election yet. Today Saskatchewan, arguably Canadas most conservative province (along with Alberta) has an election and suddenly the New Democratic Party is leading. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe made a promise that if reelected his first order of business would be to ensure transgender students can not access the proper washroom and will be made to use the one where they could be in most jeopardy. Shortly after that announcement, Moe began to consistently trail his rivals. The NDP is expected to sweep every seat in Saskatoon and even Regina as well as making inroads in smaller communities, according to polls.\n\nTransphobias electoral track record to date: 0.5\\*/3!\n\nImportant note: British Columbia and Saskatchewan have no legit Liberal party and NDP in both provinces more big tent.\n\nManitoba: Conservatives under Heather Stefansson use transphobia with the mask of ''parental rights'' and lose decisively to Wab Kinew and the NDP. Stefansson nearly loses her own legislative seat of 23 years in election, resigns from politics 7 month later.\n\n\\*British Columbia: NDP Premier David Eby nearly loses to an upsurge of support for the BC Conservatives. This election was harsh as the BC Conservatives are arguably the most right wing political party in Canada with notable Canadian Trump supporters and known internet trolls being elected to the legislature. Never the less, as shockingly close as it was the NDP was re-elected.\n\nNew Brunswick: The best result. Susan Holt and her Liberals win an historic landslide victory and openly promise to undue all the transphobic legislation then Conservative Premier Blaine Higgs implemented to restrict trans students freedom of expression. Higgs ran a very transphobia based campaign with notable religious fundamentalists running for his party. Not only was he defeated for Premier , he lost his own safe seat! a seat he won with 70% of the vote 4 years ago. Holt will be the first woman Premier of New Brunswick too!\n\nUpcoming:\n\nSaskatchewan: Suddenly the NDP is leading in popular support. It is possible the NDP wins the popular vote and loses the seat count. Either way if the NDP wins here it will send shock waves given that Conservatives often win Saskatchewan is about a 30% margin of victory and support in the 60% range.\n\nNova Scotia: Now the only province of the 5 to have the Conservatives leading by a large margin over both the Liberals and 3rd place NDP . It is however, the only one where transphobia is not a campaign issue. Interestingly, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston is a moderate-to-somewhat progressive on social issues, somewhat similar to Charlie Baker from Massachusetts. Houston appears to have made no anti trans legislation nor does it appear he will or has any desire to do so. Federally, Nova Scotia is the most likely of the 5 to vote Liberal.",

I wanted to share some thoughts about what comes up as “trans underwear” and hear what others think.\n\nTo start, I don’t tuck very often, because I usually wear baggy pants that don’t really require it. That said, I like things to feel secure and tight when it comes to underwear, and I’m on the hunt for cute, comfortable options. I’ve tried a few brands of underwear made specifically for trans women, but usually I'm just disappointed.\n\nWhen I search online, the majority of what I find is… honestly, kind of disturbing. I’m a 17-year-old girl who doesn’t want to see images of thongs, weird prosthetics, or rubbery materials that just don’t look comfortable at all. It feels like the design is tailored to a niche audience or maybe older, kinkier trans women (no judgment, just not my vibe). It’s frustrating because I just want cute, tight-fitting panties that feel good to wear.\n\nRight now, I’ve got some underwear I really like, but my options are limited to basic colors like black, pink, and sandstone. I’m wanting to expand my collection, but shopping has become such a chore because the options for trans-specific underwear feel so limited—and, honestly, kind of gross sometimes.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way? Are there others out there who just want more variety—pretty, practical, and comfy underwear? If you have suggestions for brands or types of underwear (trans-specific or not) that might work, I’d love to hear them.\n",

My mom told me it would be good for me to start engaging with people more and I was venting. He asked me how it would ever be better and I said “im trans I don’t like my chest or how I look or sound so it’s gonna be harder for me” or something along the lines of that and he kinda ignored it and said “just go out and do things with people” And I told him “I want to get top surgery so I can be more comfy with my body” and he said he had felt similar when he was fat and how he wanted to just cut it off but couldn’t. I responded with “well you can actually work out and do stuff to not be fat anymore. I can’t just work out and my breasts disappear.” And he said “That’s because you’re sick. You don’t need to mutilate yourself to feel better” I started to get angry at this point and was crying and said “The breasts are a useless body part I don’t need them” he said “Yes you do! You do need them” “why do I need them?” “It’s like cutting off your hand, it’s a part of your body” “well you actually have to use your hand for things what do I use my breasts for?” “To breast feed babies!” I left our call and was sobbing my eyes out and ignoring him but I told him I don’t ever wanna be spoken to like that again\n\nApologies were already said because this was months ago now but it didn’t feel like he was actually sorry. For a little context he’s known I’ve been trans since he met me because that’s the reason I broke up with me ex. My ex wanted kids and a family and a wife but I was too afraid about being out and felt like shit with him so I’ve finally been coming out of my shell. This isn’t the first instance but it’s one of them that’s actually stuck to me really bad. I don’t know how to bring it up to him or what to say. Also recently he asked me again if I would ever consider having kids and I said no again and he seemed bummed out. I feel like he doesn’t realize what my decisions are gonna be permanent and that I’m a boy. I feel like he’s just ignoring my identity and thinks it’s a play. He calls me by my preferred names and pronouns but it’s like he doesn’t actually care about who I am. \n\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all of your words and I am aware of how bad this looks. I’m reading each and every one carefully and rethinking my decisions with each comment and I’m going to put a pause on our relationship. I will be staying with him and committing to being financially independent for my own sake. I’m going to talk to him about everything I’m thinking of and more so start up my own life. Depending on his response I’ll stay with him. But I WILL do everything for me on my own. I’ve started to realize how emotionally dependent I am on him because all of this talk is making me feel sick and scared. And that scares me even more. I want to thank you all for the kind but also eye opening passages. I’m going to record our conversation this time so I can better document for myself for reflection and remembrance. \nAgain thank you all\n-Rye\n\nEDIT2: I’m gonna say this for more context and to give word to those being rude about my decision I don’t feel safe with being outright to him because he has all of my info of my family. I CANNOT have my family find out about what’s going on because I’m very dependent on them until I can get my own place. Being homeless is the last thing I need right now so please be considerate of these things. Depending on his response it will either go good or bad. \n\n\nUpdate: so it didn’t go good. He just said I always see the bad in people and I do nothing but bring up stuff from the past. He said he’d always be there for me and love me still no matter what I do but didn’t really acknowledge what I was telling him. He left our call and then I texted him and told him the reason why I keep tabs is so I have a reference why he doesn’t actually support me. We went back and fourth and he said “I’m taking a break. WE are” and then told me “You want help? Get a job”. I’d like to thank everyone again but I honestly don’t want to keep going anymore",

The people that have voted in favor of him are, in my opinion, practically unforgivable. \n\nHowever, we need to be much more realistic about this, especially for our transgender youth. Will it be rough? I know that it probably won't get any easier for us. But even so, we must remain strong. Trump will *not* be lining us up against a wall and shooting us, and even if he was, what will cowering in fear do for our community?\n\n We can hide and cry all we want, but it won't change anything. I want to hide too. I even cried all morning after seeing the results. It's okay to be scared and upset, but that can't stop us from also being brave. It *won't* stop us from being brave.\n\nIf we need to, we will walk in the dark until we see even a sliver of light at the end of the tunnel. We must fight for our rights just like our trans forebearers did centuries ago. The only way they'll hear us is with our voices. We will shout and scream until we win.\n\nIf you just read this and thought to yourself, \"Wow, this sounds very tone deaf!\", then maybe I'm being too idealistic for you. But I'd rather come off as an idealistic prick than a fearmongerer like Trump. Our people need a morale boost, and the dramatization of the election isn't helping me, you, or anyone else. Remember that you still have 3 months before Trump comes into office, and probably more before he passes anything anti trans. There are still blue states out there that will protect you.\n\nPlease don't give up. I have had so many friends give up their lives already, and no one deserves to feel the pain of losing a loved one. Please hold on, the fight isn't over. There is still hope.\n\n--sincerely, \na trans kid with horrible anxiety and dysphoria\n\nEdit: It saddens me that some of the people in our community are so obsessed with doom that they would call a kid a fascist for having hope.",

Here is the message I sent to my rep. Feel free to copy and paste. \n\n\nSubject: A Call for Respect and Decency\n\nDear [Recipient’s Name],\n\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the treatment of a fellow member of the House, Congresswoman Sarah McBride. While I may disagree with some of her policies, I cannot condone the actions taken against her solely based on her being transgender.\n\nRepresentative Nancy Mace has advocated for policies requiring transgender individuals to use restrooms based on their gender at birth. However, Congresswoman McBride clearly presents as female, and requiring her to use male restrooms would not only create discomfort but also target her identity in a deeply personal way. This approach undermines fundamental freedoms and disregards an individual’s right to live authentically.\n\nI understand there are concerns about transgender individuals causing discomfort in private areas, like restrooms, however - this is the exception, not the rule. Research shows that such concerns are more prevalent among non-transgender groups.\n\nAs history has shown, societies often push back against groups based on race, sex, or other differences, only to later recognize such actions as morally wrong and rooted in ignorance. Today, the same discrimination is directed at transgender individuals. I urge you to stand on the right side of history by respecting your colleagues and rejecting bigotry.\n\nI am deeply disheartened and embarrassed to see members of my government so dedicated to persecuting a group based on how they choose to present themselves. We are all human beings and deserve mutual respect and dignity.\n\nCongresswoman McBride has not even begun her official duties yet has already become the target of bullying and prejudice. As my representative, I implore you to take a stand against this behavior, protect the dignity of your colleagues, and uphold the values of fairness and decency.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nFind your representative here:\n\nhttps://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative",

    "selftext": "So I'm 34 (M) and for most of my life I thought I was just a normal guy - in that I was just a normal kind of stoic, taciturn, nerdy weird guy. There were a couple of times where I did things like try cross-dressing as an adult because I was \"curious\" (because I thought everyone must at least wonder what it's like to be the other gender at least a little bit from time to time. Also I wanted to see what the big deal about heels was - *or so I told myself it seems*) but despite how anything about it made me feel I kinda shrugged and put it to the side. I'm a guy and that's it and everything wrong or bad in my life is either due to some other terrible circumstance (poor parenting, bad school environment etc.) or something I did (or didn't do) so that was that.\n\nI even came and went on a few trans subs/videos over the years thinking I'd just learn stuff about people who were/what being trans is about - especially prudent considering I know (and have known) multiple trans people in my life. While some of it made me question and/or think about things, it never really *affected* me notably.\n\nBut today is the first day I actually sat down and read any of this ([The Gender Dysphoria Bible :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/)) thing and....I don't know the exact wording I want to use for it?\n\n*Panic Attack*?\n\nI read it at lunch during work today (most of it - I finished it when I got) home and I can only describe the feeling afterwards as like I'd just done the full 10-mile trek on my bike to all the way around the city in terms of my heart rate and shakiness (but sans the exhaustion, soreness and tiredness that would normally go with that). Like legit my heart rate tracker shows my highest BPM *in the two hours after lunch rather than the 4 mile bike ride to or from work* (the full 10 miles comes if I decide to tack on the extra mile for the long route both ways).\n\nThe trembling in my hands got bad enough at one point I briefly turned off the machine I was working at so I could refocus and get back to work so I didn't mess anything up.\n\nAnd the entire time it was like my brain had decided it was time for a review of my entire early life through college, as if that Bible was an invitation to an impromptu documentary of my life. Like my brain decided \"*Hey, that thing sounds familiar...*\" and ran with it.\n\n\"Cuz yeah, looking back at it, being trans seems like a pretty fitting explanation for...uhh, everything? The bullying, the constant depression, the anxiety, the not being too interested in boy things (though I wasn't interested in \"girl\" things either - if you asked me if preferred dolls or action figures as a kid I would've said \"LEGO!\"), getting along better with girls than boys until social pressures (and then life pressures) put a stop to those kinds of things (and then not getting along with boys too well growing up) etc. Remembering that it wasn't even as an adult that I tried cross-dressing - that the first times were as a kid.\n\nEven little things like preferring *Totally Spies* and *Sailor Moon* over more traditionally boy-flavored shows (though I still did like those shows and *Gundam* did, does and likely will forever reign supreme over all) seem to add up.\n\nRelating to women and be more concerned with their approval in college and even as an adult? Check.\n\nNot caring about my appearance, weight or looks, just doing the needed work for a functional, passing grade on appearance so that I don't look creepy or unpresentable? Check.\n\nAmong all the other things that I 'm not mentioning here to try and save on time.\n\nBut like, sitting here typing this after work and a shower, it doesn't seem right. Like it can't be right, can it? I'm just a typical, weird nerdy guy who likes nerdy guy things. I mean for crying out loud I'm nerdy and guy-focused enough that I buy collectibles [like this](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-059873) of my favorite games and anime - a pretty guy centric-thing....to which my brain (unhelpfully) responds *\"Maybe you're just surrounding yourself with totems of the thing you really wished you could be*\".\n\nReading through that Bible makes it seem like I might be the most generic, run-of-the-mill trans person out there. But that just happens to people right? Like you read it and it kicks up a bunch of dust, makes you do some self-reflection but you eventually just calm down and get back to normal right?\n\nEDIT: I feel like part of it is that....it feels like cheating? Like it's unfair that I could just look back at my life and have the explanation to most of my problems and issues throughout be \"*Yep, you're trans and that led to X*\". Put all the time and effort into thinking about other things and stuff that could be to have the (an) answer just dropped into my lap feels...offensive top my sense of how things should work?\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks to everyone that replied.",

Fortunately those Dr are good with trans people as well, because this is all news to me. \n\nNiece has mostly male clothes.

She was in a fenced back yard. \n\nMaybe 3-4 people besides my wife and I know she came out. She is not out at work or with other family. \n\nAm I being too laid back?

She told me she hooked up with other guy couple days back, and also she told me \"no hanky spanky on the first date\". But I Genuinely found her attractive and cute and to me she feels the same for me because she was complimenting me on my hands and she notices things, also she feed me with her hands when were both stoned and hungry.

    "selftext": "I have a genuine question for the trans community about using the term \"deadname\" if I am not trans. \n\nTo start, I hated my birth name. I didn't like it when I was a kid, I never grew to like it. Even saying it never came out feeling right. \n\nAs I got older it really started to just not feel like me. I felt like me, and my name felt like someone else entirely. It didn't match my personality or who I felt like I am.\n\nI'm cis, and I hated how unfeminine my name sounded. I wanted to feel feminine and my name made me feel masculine and unapproachable. \n\nSo I decided to get rid of it. The name I chose feels better and I don't hate saying it and I feel like it is a reflection of myself the way I want to present. \n\nHowever I don't really know how to refer to my birth name without calling it my deadname. I understand that term is used by transfolk to refer to their name given at birth they don't want to be used anymore.\n\nI feel like my birth name, and all the negative feelings attached to it, is dead to me. I feel like that person who had that name died when I chose my new name. So it does feel like a \"dead\" name to me. \n\nIt is also really frustrating and humiliating when someone who didn't know me before this change finds out that name...Ive had people pester me about why I changed it, call me by it deliberately, ask \"well what if I wanna call you that now?\" The worst was a coworker yelling it to the rest of the team while literally doing the wave. \n\nThe other day someone asked me if I was -insert name- and I just said \"That's my dead name\" and that actually ended the conversation. They said \"Oh, I'm sorry I won't use it.\" That seems to be what gets people to not push an inquisition on the subject I don't want to talk about.\n\nHowever, it feels like appropriating a term from the trans community because I'm not trans. I don't want to give the impression that I am because that would be disingenuous. I'm not trying to represent myself as a gender identity or part of a community I am not. I'm cisgender, so I feel that it might be wrong to be using the term that belongs to the trans community. \n\nSo my question is: is it inappropriate to use the term \"deadname\" for a name, and past identity, that is dead to me, when I am not a transperson? \n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the feedback everyone. I appreciate all the thoughts and I learned a few things about the term and about the trans community. General consensus seems that it's ok to use it, but to keep in mind some people will assume I'm trans, and be prepared to clarify in such case. Honestly, I am not bothered by that too much. I would rather clarify that I am cis instead of have to explain my name change. Thank you everyone!",

(context, 20F in UK)\n\nI don't know what it was but I got home from the gym (where I'm literally following a trans masc programme like come on now) and really forced myself to confront it. So, I'm just going to scream it all into the void and leave it there, I think. Then back to the closet :).\n\nI was thinking especially on this one time as kid where my dad brought me to catch tadpoles at this river park near where we lived. I met a boy, and his brothers there and we really got along (we were like 7 so too young to tell the genders apart). I loved the way they were treating me and I remember having such a sense of euphoria amongst it all. Then, my dad calls me by my very obviously girl name and the boy looks at me all dejected and goes 'oh, you're a girl...'\n\nAnd it *stunggg*. It stung like a bitch, and I just didn't know why. I never forgot that moment, and it just kept playing on my mind yesterday. For ages, because obviously similar instances just kept happening, I chalked it down to being uncomfortable with misogyny and how women are treated so differently by men, but then things would happen that would just wouldn't be as easily explained away. \n\nI walk past men on the street and I'm jealous. I'm jealous of their builds, and their height. I always thought myself a lesbian but honestly? I could only ever picture being with a man if I were a man myself, whereas with women I would be okay with either? I've always been a tomboy, and every time I wear something that presents me as feminine, I feel this crawling under my skin that I can't brush off. \n\nWhen men interact with me, I want to shake them by the shoulders and scream 'stop treating me like a girl'. And that sounds so much like I resent being a woman, or I agree with treating genders differently. I don't? I love womanhood. Most of my friends are women, and I only apply this insane standard to myself. It's truly one of the most beautiful things ever, but I just always feel on the fringes of it. I can't relate to men or women most of the time and it drives me absolutely fucking mental. I feel inferior to men and mismatched with women. \n\nLike, I literally have dreams of myself as a guy sometimes. And I like it. Is it over for me?? Is this it? Maybe TMI, but thinking about having sex as a guy makes it a million times more appealing (regardless of the partner's gender which I guess means I'm bi now that's cool ig). And so, I sort of looked in the mirror and went, 'fuck, this is a little odd to be thinking every single day all the time 24/7, no?'. \n\nWant more bullshit? I love male terms. Like king, instead of queen? Sir instead of miss? I want to be a father, not a mother. MALE NAMES, rather than female ones? It feels nicer, but also incredibly fucking weird and odd. But no, that's just me breaking the gender norms isn't it? Empowerment?? I want to be seen as masculine, but I always separated that from actual gender identity. I think we should abolish gender roles and then I do this? Crazy. Fake feminist, I. \n\nA part of me says 'come on, you still like feminine xyz'. I mean, you know one of the main reasons I feel like I would never want to start T is because I love my hair long and literally every man in my family is bald? That would genuinely break me. This 3c shit brushes my ass and I cannot let that go. I'm black, man, I cannot lose my hair. I also like a fair few feminine presenting things (though not many), so I constantly doubt it. It's a constant push and pull.\n\nSo, what then? I go through coming out all over again? I already lost half my family doing that, and got my nose broke, and that was just for sexuality. I know the rest that supported me are transphobic. We're Catholic lmao. Especially since, trans or not, I'm still queer. Actually fuck my life man. This will completely ostracise me from everyone in my life, I'm certain. You lot are soldiers because I cannot fathom telling anyone but my girlfriend any of this because it is so innately world shattering. Even then, what I say is all sanitised and boiled down.\n\nAlso, if I am trans, I would a short man. This bothers me. Everything is bothering me. I feel so embarrassed abut it all. I don't know what I'm meant to do. Is there a checklist one follows? What is the solution? I know virtually no trans people and this whole thing is killing me. So please, just tell me what I already know so I can just accept it and move on with my life. ",

I have socially transitioned at school, work, and every place that is not home. She is unaware of this but I think she’s gotten the hint. We sometimes discuss lgbtq, her view being its “too much”, and me trying to explain why it isnt. In todays discussion I mentioned that some of the very first people to fight for queer peoples rights were in fact trans women (stonewall riots), so that her argument about trans people being something thats come from accepting homosexuality is untrue. She said well if trans people have existed for so long then what did they do before they could get gender affirming care. So I was honest and brutal and said well they killed themselves. Thats when she said “well perhaps thats the solution, maybe it was for the better”. We talked and she absolutely meant trans people would be better off dead than receiving gender affirming care, comparing it to how elderly people are kept alive in retirement homes. As a trans person that made me feel something that the word “hurt” does not justify enough. I am not shattered, I have been crushed to fine dust. I love my mom very much despite her views on who and what I am. So how do I move on from this? How do i continue my life knowing that my own mother thinks i should die? That she would rather attend my funeral than accept me as her son. That she would rather see me dead than with a beard. How do you live with that knowledge? How do you get up in the morning and go to work or school and see your friends knowing your mom thinks it would be better if you were dead in that moment? How do you deal with that?",

On school trips rooms are gendered so I will most likely be in a room together with 1 or 2 men.\n\nThe thing I fear is that I have been getting told rape jokes (for example, \"If you were a woman I would rape you\" or repeatedly telling me they want to touch me inappropriately) and other fucked up stuff from my male classmates (they don't know I'm trans yet). When the trip starts I will be around 11 months on hrt so I will most likely pass or at least have feminine features so it will be probably even worse. (I'm also the youngest one in the class, with 1-1.5 years age gap compared to others)\n\nMy cis friends that I'm out to are telling me my fear is \"irrational\" and I shouldn't worry about it that much. So am I really over exaggerating about this? I know a lot of cishet men joke about stuff like this but It's really making me worried about something happening to me even if those are only \"jokes\"\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention but there were a lot of times when men from my class would just slap my ass, or comment on how \"fuckable\" it is.\n\nEdit 2: I am not from USA, I am from Poland, the school and teachers are transphobic and don't care about boys slapping each other asses (saying each other because I'm not out to everyone so I'm currently treated as a boy). Yes passing is really important because the teachers are TRANSPHOBIC and otherwise would not even think about letting me in girls rooms.

From first glance things seemed OK, but the first red flag was them bashing women for wearing makeup and getting plastic surgery which sure those things may have roots within the patriarchy (even though makeup has been worn by men and women since the dawn of time), and I'm not one to support choice feminism but I feel she was attacking the individuals rather then the system a bit too much. And the whole anti surgery stuff tends to ignore that it's beneficial for transgender people, a few people in the comments of these posts did ask if this applies to trans people or not and then it all went downhill from there. \n\nShe started going on about how you are what your biology is, and that trans people and trans allies are supporting a misogynistic gender ideology or something. \nI also noticed so many terfs talk about abolishing gender or something I don't know what that's about, but I think they are confused between gender roles and stereotypes (which should be abolished) and gender identity (which in my opinion is innate).\n\nThey had lots of posts like this and what was shocking is the amount of people who were agreeing with her. So many people were supporting what they said. \n\nI was already done with this account but the nail in the coffin (if that's the right saying) was seeing they followed gays againts groomers. \n\nI'm kind of fed up of anti trans rhetoric being spread in feminist spaces, I do believe lots of feminists don't realise that there saying harmful things but they are. \n\nAny ways, this was just a rant, this sort of thing has really gotten to me, and it made me upset so I needed to get it off my chest. With everything that's going on right now i worry that this sort of ideology will become popular.\n\nSo my main question is why do so many feminists think this way and why is it so popular? \n\nAnd any recommendations to feminists forums, social media accounts, youtubers etc that aren't full of terfs would be very much appreciated.\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all.\nLooking for advice.\nMy (30 nb transfemme) friend (31m bisexual) made me really uncomfortable the last time we met, to the point that I'm considering ending our 10 year friendship.\nI started transitioning 6months ago. I am pre hrt but can look very femme and attractive when dressed, makeup etc.\nMy friend (fake name - john) was a big part of my coming out, was really supportive, was the first person to go shopping for clothes with me etc. He's also recently come out as bi/queer, which sort of happened alongside me coming out.\n\nJohn is a nice person but like lots of queer polyam people he hasn't ever had the kind of affection and love he's always craved. He's quite needy for it. He's also kinky (me too) and believes in transgression/pushing one's boundaries.\n\nHe recently attended a funeral for a family friend who died suddenly. He'd also just spent an emotionally intense week with his (sort of) long distance boyfriend. (Who then left the country and flew home).This is the first homosexual relationship he's ever had(other than hookups).\nHe was quite emotional after the funeral so I suggested I come over to hang out and support him. He suggested we go to a music gig as his friend was playing and he'd promised to try and attend. So I dressed up nicely and wore makeup etc. I never really think I'm pretty but I was as pretty/passing as I ever get tbh.\n\nHe was very emotional and stoned. We met another of his friends and went to the gig. After we left, walking down the street, someone slapped my ass. John and his friend pseudonym charlie) were the only  ones behind me. I don't think Charlie is the sort of guy to do that to someone he doesn't know at all. So I believe this was John. I didn't respond at the time as I was shocked and stunned tbh.\n\nWe went to Charlie's house then back to John's were I was going to be staying (in separate rooms).\nJohn and I had a lengthy discussion about life etc as we often do.\nI was tired and said I'm going to bed.\nJohn asked me to cuddle with him in bed as he felt lonely.\nI realise this is a red flag but he honestly has talked about wanting to do this with all his friends for years. He's one of those people who loves to cuddle, in the way that women friends often do, but doesn't get the opportunity because he is male.\nI have cptsd and Autism. I do not like to be touched except in very secure circumstances by people I am very close to.\nI told him I wasn't going to do that.\nHe repeatedly tried to convince me, for instance arguing that I could cuddle for 15 minutes and then just leave and go to my bed and it wouldn't cost me anything.\nHe argued I have insecurities about my safety with others and I should challenge my boundaries for my mental health.\nI told him no repeatedly.\nEventually i went to my room to go to sleep. I already felt very uncomfortable.\nJohn followed me, hugged me a number of times, and held my face in his hands like he intended to kiss me. He also told me I was beautiful.\nI managed to sort of end the connection gently and told him I was going to bed. He left. I was so uncomfortable I put a heavy box behind the door when I went to bed. I couldn't sleep because I was so anxious so I go up about 1.5hrs later (5am) and drove home to my own house.\n\nI messaged him when I arrived to say I'd left and was now at home and we'd talk again soon.\nThe following day he sent me a voice-mail to apologize if he'd made me uncomfortable. He said this like not groveling (oh my God I'm so so sorry etc) but just like hey I'm sorry if that was awkward. I was infuriated tbh.\n\nI responded after several days to say we needed to meet in person to have a discussion about his behavior.\n\nHe responded by saying he's busy for the next few days but then we could meet. Irritatingly, he sounded pissed off, like I was responding hysterically to what had happened. I was entirely calm through all of this, including on the night in question.\n\nI spoke to a female friend, her advice is to end the friendship. John is a sweet person, but he has some real boundary issues. He was fine before I transitioned but I wonder if this is also reflective of a toxic attitude to women which I am now (somewhat) in the category of.\nI don't know if this is bad enough to end a 10 year friendship or if was repugnant behaviour but he was having a very emotional and difficult time and was responding stupidly and while drunk.\nI don't know if I can feel safe around him anymore.\n\nNo tl;Dr because you need the context.\nAny advice would be appreciated.\nThanks everyone.",

I'm surrounded by loving people who accept me 100% as I am so I don't know why I'm so sad about this.\n\nI know a gay guy, we've been friends for 4 months, and yesterday he found out I'm trans. He told me he's a type of gay guy who is only interested in cis guys with penises, which is completely fine, but he disagrees that when I have sex or relationship with someone, it's still a gay sex or relationship.\n\nJust because it's a type of sex he doesn't want, it's doesn't mean having sex with a trans guy isn't gay. I tried explaining to him that trans guys are still 100% men, but he is so stuck in thinking gender = genitals. He asked me that if someone is into men and sleeps with both cis and trans guys, why isn't he bisexual then?\n\nI'm tired of explaining my existence to people. He is so hungup on the fact he is not interested in trans men, and therefore somehow they aren't men? I don't care if he is interested in trans men or not, good for him if he only likes men with penises, that's fine, it's about the principle of trans men being 100% men even if you are not interested in them. I'm quite annoyed honestly. \n\nHe could not say he sees me as 100% a guy, only 100% a trans guy. He says he would be sad to lose my friendship because we have a \"different political opinion\". Is insisting that I only want to be seen by my friends fully as a guy too much? It is a dumb thing to lose a friend over?\n\nI've recently started becoming part of a community of gay guys who go on trips together, except me and one other guy, the rest 40 of them are cis of course. I've loved my trips with them but not I feel like I would not be able to get fully comfortable because I would be worried they don't see me as on par with them.\n\nI know I should grow some self-confidence and not worry what others think, but these gay community events are supposed to make us feel welcome. I just want to be accepted as others are. What if other guys think like my friend does?\n\nThanks for replies! ",

I want to be respectful and supportive, so l'm reaching out for guidance.\n\nFirst question: In the past, with my cisgender female partners, I found that oral sex helped create a strong connection. I'm usually very giving in this regard, but I'm not comfortable with certain aspects, particularly anything that involves putting something in my mouth. My current partner hasn't requested this. How can I start a conversation about this without being abrasive or insensitive? I want to make sure she feels comfortable, but I also want to be honest about my own boundaries.\n\nSecond question: How can I be sure that she's finishing during sex? I've done a lot of research but I'm still unsure. She's told me that she's come before, but I'm not always confident that I'm reading the situation correctly. I've asked her what she likes and tried different ways to make her feel good, and she says she enjoys our sex life. Still, I want to make sure she's truly satisfied.\n\nI'm a bit nervous about having these conversations with her because I don't want to come across as ignorant or insensitive.

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm Juniper, and as the title implies, I'm trans. I recently had a huge disagreement with one of my roommates at college (their name is James and they're nonbinary) about the usage of the t-slur. They had outed me to the RA, and asked if I wanted them to tell the RA to change the name on my doortags in the future. Ignoring that breach of privacy, I responded, without thinking it through, \"I don't think I want everyone knowing that I'm a... oops, almost said the t-slur... *chuckles* transsexual\". And then I got nothing but outright hostility from James for the next week, where my attempts at apology were met with yelling and slamming doors. \n\nI have a couple IRL trans friends, but mostly spend time in online trans spaces where the word has been widely reclaimed. I didn't realise how upset it could make other queer people in person. So now I'm moving out because I can't take the way they treat me now.\n\nWas I in the wrong for this? \n\nUPDATE: EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE\n(sorry it's so long lol)\n\nAfter a couple days, we talked it out with an impartial mediator, and I somehow forgot the fact they outed me. We talked, I apologized, and they still retained a hostile tone in their voice (not to mention they didn't apologise for outing me at all). The conclusion was \"we might not get along, but we can still share a space.\" That was a couple weeks ago as of today.\n\nThe \"peace\" didn't last. They continually closed their door whenever I would walk past their room (we have a common area that connects our separate rooms), and when I took my TV out of the common room (which they never thanks me for letting them use), Yesterday morning, James insisted that i return the larger desk i had taken from the common area (for my PC setup) in return. I didn't, and I told them outright that I was keeping the desk (after i had had a panic attack and cried plenty) because I was moving out. James responded with \"finally\". Then at some point, I remember saying, \"I am that word, who made you the expert on the trans experience?\" I was about to go on, but James had one of his friends close their door, and that was that. \n\nSo now I'm just waiting until housing gets to my room change request so I can leave. I don't have anywhere to stay in the meantime, so it's been pretty stressful having to still stay here. I'm worried they'll do something drastic, and to be honest I'm scared of them. James is unpredictable, and I hope and pray they don't try to ruin my reputation at my college, or God forbid out me to more people.\n\nI really appreciate everyone's honest imput on this, it's been really eye-opening. I'll be much more aware of my usage of the word in the future, but also be more careful of who I trust while I'm still boymoding (so, closeted to most people, I suppose).",

I cannot stress enough that if my daughter is truly trans (born male identifies female) then I support them in that, and I have been nothing but supportive up until this point. I am worried because the more we discuss things the less confident I am that they're trans.\n\n  \nWhat I do know is that she isn't happy. She's struggled with mental health in the past 5 years and has often been a loner. Within the last year she's finally found herself a friend group that's lasted more then a few months at school, and they seem like genuinely good kids. They're the weird kids at the school (her words), but they have a little group. She's also found a group of friends online to game with that seem to be good people as well. Despite these two groups being good for her, she is still unhappy with herself. You can tell she does not feel like she fits in at school.\n\n  \nAbout a month ago, things started feeling a bit off and I could tell she (at this point still he/him) had something she wasn't sharing. After a day or so, she came to talk to me and expressed that she was talking about gender identity with her discord friends and wanted to swap her pronouns to they/them. She said she had been thinking about stuff like this for the last couple years and had decided to make the swap. This wasn't shocking, there have been little clues over time that she may not be strictly male, and me and my partner had discussed it as a possibility. We talked and I expressed support, we discussed what they wanted to do next, pronoun comfort and a few other things.\n\n  \nWe spent about a week and a half with they/them before things started to feel off again. This time I asked how things were and she stated that she would like to swap from they/them to she/her pronouns. This conversation she was visibly nervous. Not a problem, we discussed explaining this to her little brother, how to address things like this to the school when she was ready, and tried to calm her down. I don't remember every detail but the topics of the conversation were how to let her be comfortable in this.\n\n  \nA few days later, she comes to us with HRT research, and talking as though this was something they wanted to do soon. We explained that things weren't that simple and HRT is a process that takes time (we're in Maryland). This was received very poorly by her, and she became quite frantic. We talked about how HRT might be something she wants down the line but it's not a magic fix, and isn't something to rush. She at several points in that conversation said \"I don't even know if I want to do this anymore\" and \"My decision paralysis is going to lock me up I just have to decide and stick to it\". We advised her to spend some time adjusting to she/her and identifying as female, and that she shouldn't pressure herself to magically know all the answers here. She seemed to understand that but several things she said during the conversation set off my parent radar enough that I went and took a look at her discord (a thing she knows I have access to).\n\n  \nHer discord community is largely non-binary individuals. They've been nothing but accepting of my daughter and she's never expressed feeling othered but now that she's changing her gender identity she's been receiving praise and support and suggestions and excitement. I'm sure all of that's coming from a good place, these people are supporting their friend, but I'm becoming worried that that attention is skewing my daughter's choices.\n\nI think to some degree that's natural for a teenager, and if this was all that was happening I would keep an eye and leave it. Who am I to say how she finds herself, if she tries on she/her and it fits her, fantastic. If she finds it doesn't and wants to go back to they/them or he/him, all good. But that's not the case for her friend group at school. They were supportive when she came out as gender fluid. Her swapping to her/her has them unsure of what to do. A few were supportive, a few were outright mean, but over the last week or so (my daughter swapped to she/her about 2 weeks ago) it's becoming clear that they'll likely lose this friend group. The message I was just shown by my daughter wasn't a cruel message, it was a message of \"we aren't sure how to be around you anymore, we're trying to figure it out and need some space\". They haven't talked to her since and are distancing from her at school. I know this could be temporary, I also know it may not be. Again, if this is because they are truly trans, it sucks but part of life is outgrowing friends. I'm terrified that it's not.\n\n  \nAnd that brings me to the end of my ramble and to where I beg for any advice. I am terrified my daughter isn't trans, and just wants to find herself the way a lot of teenagers do. I'm so scared she is losing her first stable real life friend group to follow the attention she's receiving from her online friends. And I have no idea how to even begin broaching this with her (is that even a good idea?) without doing more harm then good. How do I help her make the right decisions. I am so stuck.",

I didn’t actually think they would unban bump stocks on guns, but they did it. And never in my wildest dreams did I ever think they would rule that presidents should have full legal immunity from prosecution for any official action. But they somehow did that too. Add on top of that trump is getting back in office in a month so if any republican justices face any major public backlash for this, they can just retire and trump can appoint a judge that is just as if not more insane than the last one.\n\nSo given all that do you guys think they will just uphold the status quo? Do you think they will ban gender affirming care across the country for all minors? Are you holding out hope they might possibly rule that these bans are illegal and do something positive for once?

He enjoys Star Trek, and will listen to my continuous comments about throughout the show, which my previous partner did not. He tells me all the time about anything he thinks about and will talk for long times about his dogs. \n\nWhat’s been on my mind is that I don’t know how to call him. Before he told me he was trans I would call him “love”, “my boy” and “sweetheart”, because that’s what he is to me. But I have since researched transgender people as a whole and found that “gender affirming language” is important. “Love” and “sweetheart” are not gender affirming. Calling him “my boy” is, and I have continued to call him that, as he told me it’s “adorable” when I do that. \n\nHe also sometimes calls me things that are not traditionally masculine. He once called me a “princess” because I was overstimulated and watching Star Trek under my weighted blanket with The Captain (my cat) and Mr. Chekov (my snake). He has also called me Mr. Spock, though he later told me that it was sarcasm because I kept correcting his placement of the cutlery in my cutlery drawer.\n\nI do not know if he has a problem with my language towards him. I do not know if I should change my behaviour. I do not know if there are alternate terms for transgender people. \n\nI do not like “baby”. My partner is not an infant, he is a man. \n\n \nUpdate: \n\nI spoke with Austin a few days ago after gathering my thoughts and waiting to make sure I didn’t say anything impulsive.\n\nMy boy was amazing about this of course, and the conversation went well. He understood my uncertainty and apologised for not thinking about it; I told him, of course, that there was no reason at all to apologise as it was not him who made me uncertain.\n\nAustin told me that he has no issue at all with anything I call him presently and that he will tell me if that changes. He also told me that he quite enjoys what I call him, and he clarified that calling me Princess was because I was being “prissy” not because he thought of me as female. I still do not fully understand, but left the situation there. I will ask him again if he calls me Princess again.\n\nThank you to everyone who commented, I appreciate the advice and the more laughable ones. I’m not very sure why I’m “cute” but I appreciate the sentiment.\n\nP.S. he still calls me Mr. Spock, I still find the correlation between autism and Vulcans funny.",

    "selftext": "TW: Mentions of suicide, Transphobia, bullying, violence, mental health struggles, dysphoria\n\nI wrote a coming-out post that I'm still pretty scared to share with friends/family.  I would love to hear any thoughts on improvements or encouragement.\n\n[https://open.substack.com/pub/violetsays/p/dear-society-fuck-you](https://open.substack.com/pub/violetsays/p/dear-society-fuck-you)\n\nIf you don't want to click the link, here is the full text:\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n# Dear Society: Fuck You.\n\nWhen I was born, you declared me **a boy**.\n\nWhen I was six years old, you knew I was different and so you bullied me relentlessly.\n\nWhenever I expressed myself in a way you deemed non-conforming—such as crossing my legs, speaking the wrong way, or wearing the wrong thing—you called me a faggot or a pussy. It didn’t stop at verbal abuse; it escalated to physical violence. I would come home from school with large bumps protruding from my head after having my skull slammed into the concrete walls of the hallway.\n\nNo one was there to protect me; that much was clear. It was my fault after all. I was acting in a way that deserved punishment. I needed to adapt or I would not survive. So, I became a chameleon. I acted like the exact person you thought I should be.\n\nEach decision I made was never about what I wanted. It was about making my peers happy, making my parents happy, making my teachers happy. It was about making *you* happy.\n\nYou laid out my whole life plan even before I was born. First, I would go to school where I would get the best grades. These grades would let me get into the best college. In college, I would get the best grades so that I could get a job at the best company. Then I would work for this company as hard as I could. I would do such a good job so that I could get promotions and raises so that I could make as much money as possible. With that financial stability I could attract a woman who would have kids with me. My kids would then have the same set of expectations placed on them as you placed on me and the process would complete anew.\n\nI was such a good fucking kid. I listened and obeyed like no-one else. I got the best grades, went to the best school, made the most money. I did everything you told me to do.\n\nI’m not sad. I’m not depressed. No, that is not a tear, I AM NOT CRYING. Those feelings are for the weak. I am the embodiment of success.\n\nSo, the years go by, and I get older and older. They seem to be going by so fast, each one blending with the last. Some of the people and places change, but the story remains the same. At some point it hits me that I am going to die one day. I am going to die without ever having lived. And I knew, much like when I was a little child, that no one was coming to save me. I was going to have to save myself.\n\n# Confronting Reality\n\nThese last few decades, I lived my life for you. It has brought me so much suffering. As a child, I thought nothing could be worse than your lack of acceptance of me. I thought nothing could be worse than the verbal and physical abuse. And now, fully realizing the extent of the sacrifice I made, the sacrifice of myself and everything I am, I know that I would rather die than live for one more day under your terms.\n\nYou tell me that I’m mentally ill, that I have a mental health condition, that I’m crazy, that I’m denying reality. The entire foundation of my life thus far is built upon lies. It is built upon me pretending to be something for you. And you want to talk about denying reality?\n\nYou want me to pretend that I like wearing shorts more than wearing a skirt? You want me to pretend that I like wearing suits better than dresses? You want me to pretend that I like being dominant more than submissive? You want me to pretend that I’d rather penetrate my partner than be penetrated by them? You want me to pretend like I don’t want long flowing hair? You want me to pretend that I like having facial hair?\n\nWhy should I pretend this? Who is denying reality—me or you?\n\n# Sex & Gender\n\nI know I was born with a penis. I know that the cells in my body have XY chromosomes. I also know that I love to sing, and sew, and cook, and show emotion, and dress and act in a way that feels good to me.\n\nYou tell us that because we were born a certain sex, we automatically have 1000 predetermined personality traits. And yes, some of the time you are right. I was born a boy and I like legos more than barbie dolls. Good job, you got that one correct. But there are so many others that you got wrong. Because you don’t know me—only I know who I am. I am the one living in this body. I know my needs, desires, and wants more than you could ever hope to.\n\nAll of these traits which you associate with someone’s sex are called **gender**. It’s so important to distinguish between sex and gender. Sex is biological, but gender is something created by you, our society. Gender is a set of expectations that society puts on sex. These expectations shift and change over time, but they are always present.\n\nGender is like The Matrix — a completely fabricated world, but because it is all around us and we know nothing else, it appears to be immutable and real. But there is nothing real about saying “a boy can’t like pink” or “a boy can’t like to wear a skirt”.\n\nLike Neo, I wish I could escape The Matrix and enter a world where gender didn’t exist, where I could simply like what I like without being categorized or classified. As of yet though, I am stuck here in the matrix.\n\n# Categories & Boxes\n\nDon’t get me wrong — categorizing is useful. It helps us predict how others might behave based on limited data, which is key to survival\n\nIf I tell you that someone supports the right of every person to own a firearm, you could predict, with pretty high accuracy, that this same person would also be in favor of lowering taxes. These categorizations exist because they are useful tools for our brains to predict things about people. Sometimes the categorization is wrong — for example, there are plenty of people who support the right to own a firearm who also are interested in raising taxes to support social programs. But as long as the categorization is right *most of the time*, it is useful to people.\n\nImagine I attend an NRA convention because I support the right to bear arms. Someone smiles at me, pats a ‘Proud Republican’ sticker on my shirt, and says, ‘Thanks for supporting our cause.’ Now, let’s say I agree with Republicans on this one issue, but for 999 others, I’m a Democrat.\n\nWith this “Proud Republican” sticker stamped on me, let’s analyze what happens when I interact with different people. A republican sees my sticker and invites me over to their house for dinner. At dinner, the conversation turns awkward very quickly. “What do you mean, you support abortion?!” “You’re not a real republican! Who gave you that sticker?!!!”. And any democrat who I come across will see my sticker and immediately turn away from me saying, “eww, a republican!”. Wearing this sticker effectively sabotages almost every interaction I have with other people.\n\nGender operates in much the same way as that sticker. I am walking around the world with a sticker that says “I’m a boy”. Even though, if you look individually at the 1000 characteristics that categorize people into “boy” vs “girl”, I would fall into the “girl” category for the vast majority of them. Because of the incongruence between my actual internal identity and the category in which I am placed, I am perfectly positioned to fail miserably with almost every interaction I have with people. The people who think they like me realize that I’m not the person they think I am. The people who look at me and immediately decide that they don’t like me miss out on what could have been a very rewarding connection.\n\nThese boxes and categories—created by YOU—are both artificial and powerful. This is why I can’t just ignore gender. This is why I can’t just be “a boy who wears a dress”. The category matters way more than any individual interest or trait.\n\nThe next time you see someone you ‘suspect’ is transgender because one trait doesn’t align with the others, just know that this person is not “pretending” to be a man or “pretending” to be a woman. This person was pretending their whole lives to be something else for you and they finally had the courage to be who they really are.\n\nDo you really think I enjoy this or that it’s just for attention? I spent my entire life trying to hide. I minimized myself constantly in order to make other people more comfortable. I don’t want your attention, I just want to live my life as me. “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness”. That’s what I want, just to be left alone to live life in the way that makes me happy. Is it really so difficult?\n\n# Difficult Topics\n\nThe conversation becomes more fraught when people perceive trans rights as infringing on the rights of other people. The biggest topics lately have been about access to gender-affirming care for adolescents, access to bathrooms, and access to sports.\n\nPeople are being told that their kids are going to get “trans’d” at school, come home, and want to get their genitals cut off. Fear has taken over, leaving logic, reason, and compassion behind.\n\nWhen considering these issues, reflect on my story and those of other trans people. Think about what would have helped us vs hurt us. Talk to trans people and listen to their perspectives—we’re rare, but we exist. You may have never met one of us before, but maybe you should before you make sweeping decisions that affect all of us.\n\nFor me, I wish I had been born in a time when people openly talked about gender in school. I wish I had figured this out much sooner. I wish I had access to puberty blockers and hormones as a kid. Undoing the effects of male puberty as an adult is an enormous challenge. It’s expensive, it’s painful, and the results are never as good as they could have been if I’d had access to care earlier.\n\n# Waves Goodbye\n\nLike being gay, being trans is just one possible part of the human experience—and it is not a choice. I would never have chosen this for myself. Yet every time I’ve tried to ignore it or deny it, it has felt like standing in the ocean, trying to fight the waves.\n\nI hope the world becomes a more accepting place for us, even though it seems to grow more hostile each day. We make up just 1% of the population, yet we are demonized by mobs with pitchforks—people who bear an unsettling resemblance to the bullies of my youth. We are 4x more likely to be victims of violence, and 40% of us attempt suicide. Being trans is already hard, but the relentless pressure and hostility we endure often make life unbearable.\n\nIf you had been with me in the hallways of my school all those years ago, I hope you would have stood by me against the bullies. I hope you would have seen me as worth protecting—as human, and as worthy of living. I hope you can stand by me now.\n\nYou may have met me before, but you didn’t really know me—just a meticulously crafted mask that I created to protect myself. I am taking it off now.\n\nMy name is Violet, nice to meet you.",

I feel like this might just be okay, and it was so encouraging to have other parents and people who have transitioned tell me I’m doing okay. \n\nAlso, to all of those with kind strong hearts who have opened up about the people who have let them down to help me do better, from the bottom of my heart THANKYOU all and if you never hear it from those that you should, please hear from me that I’m so proud of you and so grateful that you exist and live in kindness. I am reading all of the comments and hope to respond by tomorrow but as you can imagine it’s been an overwhelming day, but I see you all and cannot express my gratitude enough! Monday I will be contacting the helplines and support services suggested and I’ve just ordered some recommended books too! Love you all, and thank you again!  \n\nALSO those who mention autism and therapy, my daughter has a diagnosis of autism and adhd  so you were right on the money there lol, I also have adhd and am in therapy although I will be seeking out more specific help for this. Also so random but just realised she’s got chicken pox, fab! (I live in Ye Olde England so we don’t vaccinate for that here, we just carry our poc marked shame, plague style).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly I don’t know if the trigger warning makes sense but I don’t want to hurt anyone by making them feel uncomfortable by being frank about my feelings as a parent, and if I do I am really sorry this is all new and I’m drowning in confusion over what’s right and wrong to say. You’re all valid and I’m here for your help, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in you all.\n\nI’ll be honest I don’t even know what I’m looking for with this post, I’m currently just sat crying because I’m so scared of fucking this up and I also feel a strange sense of grieving which I feel so guilty for too as I’m not phobic and I’m surprised I’m having such a tough time with this. \n\nTo protect her I don’t let it show obviously, she’s said since about 3 that’s she’s a girl sporadically, but didn’t mind her very male name or pronouns, this didn’t bother me, I don’t have a problem with my child being trans I just want them to have a better life than me.\n\nHowever for some reason using her/she pronouns hurts, my child is in no danger of me being unsupportive or stopping the feminine pronouns etc as I know it’s my job to make my child feel safe and comfortable, not the other way around, I’m just so confused and feel somehow like I’ve lost something. I dread to think that the way I feel now is what she feels like every time I’ve called her a boy. I have a lot of guilt and regret for not being more observant. \n\nMy child is only 5, I’ve spoken to school, the government policies in England mean they can’t use preferred pronouns til secondary school (11/12ish) however her teacher and SEN lead are fully on board and have supported as much as they can. \n\nthey have informed all the staff to NOT use male pronouns and use her name. Her teachers  already make the effort to call my child by name, and try not to split or refer to the children by gender in groups etc to negate the issue. They have responded to children saying he’s a boy by saying it’s up to ‘child’s name’ they can be whoever they want to be, and reprimanding antagonistic behaviour same as they would with any non offensive word being used to antagonise or bully.\n\nIn short they said they can’t correct the kids for calling her a boy (but will not correct children calling her a girl) , and calling her a boy is not against the rules, which I get with them only being 5, but they can and will intervene if children are being antagonistic and using it to hurt her. They are asking me what support we need and want and have arranged for a meeting with the educational psychologist. \n\nIf you’re still with me and have any advice for how i can access support for myself my husband(we are both supportive) and our daughter please help, even if there are phrases i can say to make her feel validated etc literally I’ll take any help i can get (gp isn’t really interested til she’s older and continues to  present as female, will call mermaids on Monday). \n\nThank you for reading, i know this was long i just love my child so much and i know that the way my parents treated me and the things they said growing up still affects me, i really want to limit my child’s chances of trauma and be their best friend through this.

Right, so to say.\n\nTo clarify, there's quite a lot of posts where (cis) people are asking about certain behaviors from their trans partners, and tbh none of it has anything to do with being trans. I can't help but wonder if they think being trans means we're different somehow, like we're all the same person just because we share one thing in common.\n\nI don't like it. I understand its not malicious behavior, but can it please stop? I'd like it if a new rule were put in place for this subreddit, where making posts about other trans people's behavior was no longer allowed (with certain exceptions ofc). Who here agrees??\n\nEDIT: I've noticed some people don't understand what I mean (SnooObjections9416). I'm trying to make posts unrelated to this subreddit against the rules. For example (nsfw); I recently saw a post where a cis person was asking why their trans partner wants a threesome. THAT'S NOT RELATED!!!

Because it included our great-great-grandmother‘s youngest sister I captioned it “Five generations of (surname) women.“\n\nThe problem is that a few years ago one of her high school friends posted a picture of them pre-transition. She was upset and asked not have pictures of her as a ‘boy’ & if they had to post a group shot to not tag her with her proper name & especially not her dead name.\n\nI thought since she was 3 months old and in a blanket that could have mistaken for pillow that it would be alright to tag her. Especially since it was labeled women. But I got a text from her that simply said “Don’t post pre-transition pictures“ I was with her sister at the time & she said since it didn’t tell me to take it down to just leave it up. Should I take it down anyways? I already untagged her. Is this a line I should have know not to cross? I plan to actually talk to her on the phone to find out more but I don’t know if I need a big apology.\n\nUPDATE/ PLOT TWIST\n\nSo my cousin just called me to thank me for the post. I was obviously confused & asked about the text. She didn’t know what I was talking about. Turns out her (now Ex)boyfriend sent it from her phone. Apparently he has been stirring up drama with family. She did clarify that anyone can post pictures & tag her up to age four when she had to get her “big boy” haircut (it had been nearly down to her shoulders prior) and confirmed that for her high school & or earlier friends they can post pictures pre transition if they don’t tag her, but that for close family she would prefer we not. I want to thank all of you for your advice. I didn’t realize that baby/toddler pictures could be a problem.",

As a result asking the transmasc people in my local community doesn't really provide an accurate insight to an equivalent experience.\n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone 👋 for the last few years, I've been noticing a trend. I tend to befriend trans people regularly, I'm often attracted to trans women, and my child has also mentioned questioning their gender. \n\nI'm a 31M cis guy, and I'm bi/pan. A few years ago I started gaming heavily online and most of the friends in  my life currently are online. My best friend of nearly 4 years is a trans woman, and I often \"click\" with trans people I meet online. I can't quite put a finger on it, but I simply enjoy the company of a lot of trans people. When I'm looking to make friends on subreddits like r/makenewfriendshere or similar, I wouldn't say I exclusively seek out trans people or only consider them when looking for a friend, but their posts do tend to stick out to me and a part of me is extra hopeful that they'll respond to me. On discord, I play with anyone regardless of gender, buuut I'm more likely to join a lobby with trans women in it and a part of me is a little extra happy when they join my lobbies. \n\nAs for attraction, my last few sex partners were trans women met on grindr, and I greatly enjoyed the sex and their company.  I do often sort by tribe on grindr, and I usually sort for trans/twink/geek. I'm occasionally attracted to masc people, but I'm generally into more feminine people ~90% of the time. I tend to find trans women's voices very cute, and I often find their bodies beautiful. It goes beyond physical attraction as well. I usually agree with trans women on politics/social issues, I find a lot of them emotionally intelligent, the conversations with them are usually quite stimulating, and I just find them easy to open up to emotionally. I understand that women aren't a monolith, and no demographic of women is a monolith. There's plenty of trans people I'm not interested in, and plenty of cis people I am interested in. But nerdy, feminine trans women are sort of my \"type.\"\n\nLastly, and this could be a separate post since I'd like any sort of advice on this as well, my child has mentioned that they don't want to be a girl, and that they don't want to have a gender. I assured them that I love them no matter what, and had a few conversations about trans people since they've likely never encountered an openly trans person in their young life. Whatever they decide to do genderwise, I'm here to support and love them all the way. When they told me though, the main thing I thought was \"Wow. Why does it seem like theres so many trans people in my life now? Trans friends, trans fwb, and now potentially my child.\"\n\nAll of this being said...whats goin on here? Is it odd/wrong that I'm drawn to trans people? Am I a chaser? My bestie assures me that I'm not a chaser, but her logic seems to boil down to \"I'm not an asshole and I respect them.\" Is that what it means to be a chaser? I feel guilty because I don't want to fetishize someone, and I don't want to make someone feel like I'm only interested in them because they're trans. My friend has also occasionally called me an egg, but I really don't think so. In general I think gender roles and gender stereotypes sort of suck, but I feel pretty comfortable being a guy. I have my own insecurities like anyone else, but I don't want a woman's body.\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate any advice I can get 🙏",

I’m 6’2” and really wish I was smaller so I made a joke “Of course the two trans people are the only ones who don’t wanna be measured”. He gave me a weird look and I immediately got worried that maybe he wasn’t trans and that I really fucked up. \n\nI clocked him as trans when I first met him only because I had a close friend who had very recently started HRT and I noticed a lot of similarities between the two of them. He maybe looks a little young for his age, but genuinely passes super well. In hindsight, I made a massive assumption and I should never have talked about it unless he brought it up first. If I get it wrong and he’s a cis dude, it’s awkward and I probably made him feel shitty. If I’m right and he is trans, I clocked him and I definitely made him feel shitty. It’s a lose lose like wtf was I thinking bro\n\nHe approached me after class and said “I’m not really open about that stuff and I’d prefer if it wasn’t talked about”. I immediately apologized and assured him it wouldn’t happen again. He left pretty quickly after that and now I’m playing the moment over and over in my head wishing I’d never said anything. \n\nI’m so embarrassed and feeling so dumb. Is there anything I can do to make the situation better? I’m pretty sure no one else heard my “joke” so at least there’s that. To my knowledge, I’ve never met someone who’s stealth and I’m nowhere even close to passing so I just didn’t think about it. Right now my only thought is to do exactly what I said and never bring it up again but im still wondering if there’s more I could do to make things right. Any guidance would be really appreciated. \n\nedit: thanks for the responses. I’m pretty sure I didn’t out him or anything but I understand the point is I could’ve, which is unacceptable. I’m in a small performing arts school that has a lot of openly queer folks and some people ( I guess me this time) have a bad habit of being overly familiar.

I am heavily sympathetic towards this, she is very outwardly masc presenting due to her family being unaccepting and deals with a lot of dysphoria due to this due to not looking how she wants in order to date. I have always been able to talk her down from these episodes and when she’s made a comment I’ve made sure we talked it out.\n\nRecently, though, she’s been mentally through the wringer and the comments have hurt a bit more.\n\nWe were driving together earlier and I mentioned horrible pain I had been having the past few days. I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and struggle with a lot of health complications due to it. She knows this. \n\nAfter I had mentioned the pain I was in she sighed and went “well at least you have ovaries!” and it made me feel like absolute shit. I told Emily how it made me feel and she kind of apologized, but I felt heavily iced out for the rest of the night. I told her when it happened that she does not want the issues I face and that I wouldn’t wish them on my worst enemy, and she told me “I wouldn’t either” and ended up glossing over the whole thing entirely.\n\nI love Emily dearly, but comments like this make me feel heavily alienated & uncomfortable. I feel like an asshole for being as upset as I am about it, but it really fucking hurt.\n\nThis combined with another comment she made in relation to me getting gross dms/harassed by men in general (in response to some complaining I did about it she said she “wished she got attention” basically) really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nShould I unpack why I feel upset like this, or am I justified in how I feel?

It's been going great, we get along well enough, even though us being lone distance makes things rough. Every once in a while, she'd make jokes about neo pronouns and I'd just dismiss it, like \"ah, moonself, the 9th one I've met.\" I thought it was light hearted in the same area as \"I'm pansexual, hide your cookware.\" Recently, she's been going on what seemed like more mean spirited rants about neo pronouns and gender neutral language. All of it is the same One Joke, like \"I'm helldiver gender, my pronouns are diver/diverself,\" \"I've met so many people that are sun gender, it's so stupid, you can't transition into the sun,\" and \"technically I'm not transgender since I'm intersex, I'm just going to female.\" I'm getting tired of it, and even when I explain how I see concepts like neo genders, I get 'agree to disagreed' and we never go anywhere. The only time she relented was on the intersex point, when I pointed out that definitionally She's going from one gender to another. She's really stubborn about her positions, to the point where we took a minor break after we got into an argument about \"female lead\" as a gaming category. Are these red flags? How can I talk to her about this? Any advice? I considered putting this on relationships or something but I figured this place may be best.\n\nEdit: I'm talking to her about it today. I'm also dropping the stuff about being intersex. I didn't really realize how rude that came off, and I'm always learning what I'm doing wrong. ",

    "selftext": "I am a gender queer person with a vulva. I’m not on T and don’t have top surgery. To give you an idea about how my gender is externally perceived, I think most people who know about non-binary people assume I am non-binary, and anyone else assumes I am a masc queer woman. I am occasionally assumed to be a man in passing, but not in conversation. \n\nProbably at least 20%-30% of the time I go through airport scanners, my crotch gets flagged and I have to get a pat down in the area. I know generally how these scanners work in that they pre-select a gender, but I don’t understand why my crotch is flagging? If they thought I was a woman, nothing should flag because my anatomy matches. If they thought I was a man, my chest might flag as extra material, or maybe my crotch might flag because I don’t have a dick, but I doubt I’m being mistaken as a guy 20-30% if the time. Also, often when I’m pulled aside they automatically have a woman pat me down, so they don’t think I’m a man. \n\nI have a few theories, but none seem to fully fit. \n\n1. The extra fabric I don’t fill in my boxers sometimes flags the sensors. However, I’ve recently switched to “women’s” boxers which don’t have any extra fabric, and have still been pulled aside. Also, I wore them quite high waisted and there really wasn’t much extra fabric. \n\n2. My genital piercing is flagging it. However, from my research, this is only an issue at super large gauge piercings. It does not protrude at all. Also, getting flagged predates the getting the piercing. \n\n3. Originally it was the boxers flagging it, but since I’ve switched underwear and gotten a piercing, it’s now the piercing flagging it. This does line up timeline wise, but I don’t think either would be substantial enough to flag the sensor that often in the first place. \n\nAny ideas? It happens across different countries and cultures. It’s not too much of an issue, I mainly want to find out what might be causing this as a curiosity. However, I definitely have had uncomfortable experiences getting pat down so often and have had staff say weird things about my gender. Thanks! ",

    "selftext": "Well I just got spent a good chunk of the night arguing with someone over the “ethics” of T4T dating on r/mypartneristeans. The cis woman I argued with claimed that it would be unethical “like a black person not wanting to date a white person”. Most of her comments were removed by the mod team (at which point she made two identical posts in r/transmedical asking how they felt about it). When I reached out to the mods to see if I could make a post about how the community of r/mypartneristrans felt about T4T in general and was told it’s not a “trans centric” community and that I should post somewhere else. So here I am. \n\nI (mtf) am dating another trans person (nb). My partner was already open when we met (aside from their parents) and I was a very confused egg. They expressed hesitation in wanting to date a cis guy, given their past history, but I won them over with my “beautiful eyes” and now almost two years later and with a lot of soul searching we are in a blissfully happy T4T relationship. \n\nWhen they expressed their hesitation in getting into a relationship with a cis person, I was hurt. Not because I felt like they owed me a chance, but because I understood their perspective. As I’ve been going through the process of transitioning, we are of course keeping communication as a top priority. One of the things we’ve discussed is how much more understood we feel by each other. How we don’t feel the need to explain things to each other that we might have to explain to a cis person. We both feel that in future, even if we weren’t together, we would likely seek out other transgender people (regardless of gender identity/ presentation) as partners over cisgendered partners. Not that we wouldn’t be open to dating a cis person (like how they dated me even when I presented as a man) but that the shared experience of us both being transgender allows us the comfort we both need to connect on a deeply profound level. \n\nSo is it unethical to (as a transgender person) primarily seek relationships with other transgender people as opposed to giving every single cis person the chance they do rightfully feel entitled too?\n\nEdit: a moderator from r/mypartneristrans asked me to stop “bad mouthing” their sub on other subreddits (which they asked me to move to). Apparently I wasn’t actually supposed to tell people about my experience there and what I perceived as transphobic rants were actually just vulnerable cis people expressing their feelings. My apologies.\n\nEdit 2: didn’t think I’d need to say this but I really don’t care what truscum have to say about T4T thanks",

On my birthday his mom bought me a tiara and a bunch of girly stuff, that I clearly didn’t want. He explained to her I don’t like being called by my biological name,  I don’t like girly stuff, and she apologized. (my boyfriend finally stuck up for me, he said he would for months and didn’t till this happened and I threatened to breakup with him.)\n\nI recently got my first short haircut, which I love, and I started testosterone almost two months ago (which she doesn’t know about). I’ve never felt more like myself than I do now. But since I’ve started looking different physically, she refers to me as his friend when introducing me to people. It hurts so much. To live with someone and be together for almost a year and a half, and to go to their thanksgivings, christmases, funerals, and just be called his friend???\n\nThere was a loss in his family recently, and she listed me in the obituary using my deadname. She gave me a long winded explanation that she knows I don’t like it, but she put my birth name instead of my chosen name because she “wouldn’t want people thinking we’re a gay couple.” She is liberal, and posts on Facebook about being pro-lgbtq so I don’t understand why she is treating me like im a secret, or an embarrassment. \n\nToday at the funeral I was introduced time and time again as his friend. Even though the people have met me before as his “girl-friend.” Obviously I didn’t say anything since it was a funeral, but it still hurts either way. One lady thought I was his brother, but was quickly corrected by another woman that “I am a girl.”\n\nI honestly don’t know what to do. I’m always uncomfortable being around his family at big events like that, and I got so many looks when I was there. I personally don’t have family, I was homeless before going to college due to my grandparents passing away, so they’re really all I have for right now. I just don’t think I can do this anymore. \n\nIn about a month I will be doing photography at one of his family members wedding, and I plan on wearing a suit which I’m really excited for but I can only imagine the comments I will get then. What is his family going to do when the T starts kicking in and I have a low voice and facial hair? What are they gonna do when I get top surgery? I have felt so much doubt during my transition because I have no support, and this just feels like a knife in the chest. \n\nAny advice or anything is welcome. Idk what I’m asking/looking for. Has anyone else been through similar? I fear this relationship won’t work out in the long run and I think I rather end it before I’m in too deep with unsupportive in-laws.\n\nEdit:\n\nPeople keep saying I need to have self respect and you’re right. It’s just really hard honestly, I don’t have any family, and barely any friends. I am locked into a year lease, and the landlord is trying incessantly to get us to resign again. Trust me I’m embarrassed to even say I am in this situation. Somehow I always get convinced or convince myself to stay. I’ve had doubts about this relationship specifically due to transitioning, since the beginning. \n\nI have a therapy appointment Monday. I’m not the greatest at talk therapy and never know how to answer questions, so he told me my homework was to think about what I want in a partner. Idk why that’s been so hard for me to answer, but I think this thread is helping me figure that out. ",

My wife struggled a little with that but we faced it together, talked a lot about fears and changes and stuff like that. I can say our relationship even improved. She is a champion in supporting me and it would be so much harder for me without her.\n\nNow that our son came out to us my wife is struggling again. \"What are the odds? Can someone in this family please attend a statistics seminar?\" She even said that she thinks maybe something else is wrong in our family/relationship, without specifying it. We can openly talk about the whole thing, but she's kinda distant and wants to be alone more often than before. It's quite the setback.\n\nMy son and I have the feeling that we are invalidating each other's transness because of the statistical improbability of two persons in a family of four being trans (and the other son be gay). It certainly seems to others like we're just nonconforming for the sake of nonconforming.\n\nI'm sure we will get through this and we will definitely support our son no matter what.

I won't question your transitionary period, whether you are still going through it or not. Simply put, you are already there, for me.\n\nObviously, this belief is on such a personal level, and I'm not oblivious to the struggles that our trans community faces. However, my friend emhpasised that my personal view itself is very problematic and dismissive. That's why there's a \"T\" in LGBT. And that bothered me so much, because I obviously do not want to incite prejudice.\n\nMy friend, themselves, is not trans. Perhaps this is a conflict of our own echo chambers with our personal relationships of different groups of trans people. Or, perhaps, I am being ignorant?\n\nI'm not sure if the entirety of my thoughts were coherent enough in this post but I hope you get what I'm trying to say. I'm open to be enlightened and educated better. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Oh my god! I did not think my hungover rambling would garner this much attention. I'm thankful for all your insightful and poignant comments. This has truly been a humbling learning moment for me, and a good reflection for my naivete regarding the trans movement as a whole.\n\nI'd like to address first the use of the trans adjective without space. This is pure ignorance on my part, and I'm really sorry. Perhaps, for context, transgender (I googled, it doesn't have a space lol) discourse in my environment is often verbal, and if written, is not in English (country is not primarily English speaking). Truly, this is my first time being taught of this but I'll **definitely** be more aware next time, and educate others.\n\nNow, to the main point: As I have asked, so I did receive. I have been very enlightened. What seemed like two opposing ideas were truly meant to go hand in hand. Yes, accept who they represent wholeheartedly, without question, but acknowledge the plight, struggles and challenges faced **because** they are trans.\n\nReflecting on it, it did seem too \"rose-colored\" and \"goody two-shoes\" and I apologise for being tone-deaf.\n\nI'm just happy that my heart is in the right place. You've all been lovely, truly. You all deserve the best. May our future be just, safe and as colorful as our flag.\n\nI'm sort of leaving my endnote here already since I'll be off the grid for a couple of weeks, but I'll still look forward to additional comments that I can read when I get back.",

Yes, some young children have transitioned, but their cases are exceedingly rare and are the exception.\n\nUsually if a minor transitions they are already at least 14-17 years old. At that age range they are already old enough to drive a motor vehicle and are expected to choose their future career. Sure, they aren't legal citizens and can't do things like vote (but they are expected to start learning the responsibilities associated with voting) or live on their own (but again are encouraged to start learning its responsibilities), but they are supposed to in general prepare for adulthood. By this age, teens are already old enough to make some of their own decisions in life and are encouraged to by society. Why is it then, that when it comes to these issues people treat them like idiotic children incapable of thinking for themselves, but still allow them to make other crucial choices for their lives. \n\nParticularly, I myself am a young trans kid. My parents fully support my decisions regarding my career, choosing a college, buying a vehicle, pre-registering to vote, etc. BUT, when it comes to transitioning, they claim that it's \"just a phase\" and that I'm too immature to make an important decision like this.\n\nSpecifically, I want to know where this narrative began in the first place and how it has become so wide spread among conservative circles.",

This was used to defend against homicide cases where a \"surprised\" cis het would murder usually a trans woman upon discovering they were transgender. My question is for trans women, how often or have you ever found yourself in a Trans Panic situation? How did you escape from it? I apologize in advance if my question is triggering.\n\nEdit: added spaces for trans woman",

Which, I don’t mind, but it is definitely weird That there’s a need to ask it suddenly.\n\nmore days forward on, I am finishing a math test late cause I am disbaled in learning. a group of students who are awaiting to get their classroom free are saying things to each others like « yo that’s a boy or a girl? Wtf is that thing? A helicopter? LOL » while clearly looking at me.\n\nhigh school lunch awaiting queue, a girl who is in the girls dormitory asks me why am I on some list about students included in the girls dormitory. I told her it’s weird and all, and so I then asked administrative. They looked for it, but clearly said such things didn’t exist. So the girl was probably asking me in a very weird way my gender and body settings Cause she was too scared to directly ask.\n\nmore days forward, I am in a situation where my door neighbor is overacting to any small noises my movement makes. (Even in broad daylight). i won’t get into details but he quite literally once told me « STOP MOVING YOU SLUT TRANS ASS » (best way I could translate it in English). And another time, he punched the walls again to make me understand I’m bothering him, and he was in a phone call. I won’t say everything but he straight up said to the person « IM TELLING YOU SHE HAS A PUSSY!\".\n\nwhat happened to my passing?

When I first realized last year, I wanted to broach the subject with him because I am fully in support of whatever he needs or wants from me but was advised to let him tell me in his own time by a close friend whose daughter was going through a similar transition.\n\nI have tried to drop hints that I love and accept him and will do whatever he needs. I found a binder in his laundry and offered to buy more, when I realized he preferred certain types of bathing products and deodorant, I made sure they were there for him without asking. \n\nfast forward to my current dilemma. He asked his girlfriend‘s mom to buy him trans tape because he doesn’t want it delivered to our house. But he has to pay for it and definitely doesn’t have it lying around. Can I message the mom and pay her and not put my child in an awkward situation? Do I tell him I know? \n\nI am so worried that he’s struggling and I don’t want him to but I also don’t want to hurt him or make him feel worse. I wish he felt better about telling me because it changes absolutely nothing for any of us. \n\nI hope this is okay to ask here, but I would love any advice or words of wisdom. And if I’m doing it all wrong and need to do something else, I’m here for that. ",

And I’m like “ehh I like that to happen naturally. I will say I’m a firm bottom (mostly bc of dysphoria, but I still like to be touched), but I don’t care to have long drawn out convo’s about my sexual interests, esp right off the bat” and THEY GO ON and tell me about their sexual interests and how it’s just different for men and women (which I understand because my sex drive WAS a lot higher pre-hormones), but like… am I just too far in to realize this is how guys are? Am I supposed to accept that all men will want to speak sexually a lot of the time.\n\nI’ve been on dates where they jokingly mention me at their place at the end of the night and I’m like “we just got here five minutes ago? WTF are your hobbies!” \n\nAnd then there are the obvious guys who ghost after I do in fact go back to there place.\n\nI’m getting discouraged from dating. I guess I should forgo the dating apps but then how do yall talk to men in public as an openly trans person? Did you meet in person? At a trans specific event? Do you do anything specific in online dating to deter men from asking these questions?\n\nI know this all might sound crazy and like I am boy-crazy, but it’s just hard to find something meaningful and it’s hard. Almost all of my trans friends have sworn off men and transitioned to be a lesbian and some actually hate men viscerally, so everytime I open up about it, they seem almost annoyed that I’d be into men.\n\nIdk just looking for advice of other “straight” trans-femmes to tell me if you understand all these crazy feelings.",

    "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nI have a daughter who has been quite sure they are a girl for over a year now, after presenting as a girl (dresses, bows, etc) since she was old enough to pick her own clothes. She's 5 and headed to kindergarten.\n\nWe had the convo with everyone about pronouns and being supportive in the classroom, but when I related this info to her, she asked if I could tell her new teachers to call her by her \"superhero names\". She will often ask to be called things like Ladybug Girl, or Bumblebee, or Wonder Woman for the day and we go with it; but her daycare teachers refer to her by her birth name which is rather masc (not totally, it'd pass for an adventurous femme name as well imo).\n\nSo she asked to be called by her superhero names. I said that teachers don't call kids by superhero names, but I said that if it was important to her to pick a regular name that felt more like a girl name, that would be okay. She instantly brightened up and said \"it's important to me\" and asked for some suggestions.\n\nWe talked about it for a bit and found a name she liked. But my question is this: is it reasonable or good or desirable for a Kindergartener to pick their new name? If she gets to older elementary or middle school and doesn't like it, would it be reasonable to ask her to keep it for the sake of consistency, or should I allow her to change it whenever she feels? I feel like making her keep her masc name is cruel, but I'm not sure what to do about the re-nameing and name choosing process. Any insight from those here who have done a name change or struggled with picking a name?\n\nThanks so much for your help!\n\nTLDR: how do I balance consistency over time while also honoring self expression in my young trans child?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for your comments! I have read through all of them and have a good idea on where to start, I appreciate it so much! At this point we are just talking a social name change with the school, and your perspectives have really helped me refine how to think about it. Thank you!",

Sorry in advance.\n\nMy best friend came out as trans...\n\nOk, i just really need to write this out because i've just been hit with a bombshell and my teeny tiny straight brain can't comprehend the news that i just heard. Feel free to comment and give advice. I just need to write my feelings on this topic. (There are going to be spelling mistakes, English is my second language.) FYI Before you read. I'm fully aware that i am a stupid uncultured and ignorant asshole... But i really want to help my friend...\n\nMy friend who i've known now since i was 16 (now 24) just recently had a lot to drink when we played video games this last night. In his drunken stupor he talked a lot of his mental health and how he struggles alot with it to me and his other friend on a voice call (Depression and self harm were the big topics)\n\nWe play and hang out as much as we can when we're not working opposing shifts. As you do. We are best friends after all!\n\nAbout a year ago we were sitting on his couch having some beers and got totally shitfaced, laughing and telling jokes...but as it so often happens he started to tell me about his feelings, he starts opening up to me about his insecurites and such. I, as the good friend that i try to be listens to him of course. And he tells me he is Bisexual.\n\nHe tells me that he doesn't see gender as a defining factor of why he likes someone as a romantic partner. He was troubled by having to be drunk to tell me this but i reasured him that i was fine with it. \"Whatever floats your boat\" i said.\n\nBut i feel like an asshole... Because i became uncomfortable with these news. I didn't know what to think. Of course i knew that he wasn't hitting on ME and was going to confess his love or something. I know that much. But it kind of... Rubbed of on me in a uncomfortable way. I don't know how to describe it.\n\n A couple days pass and we don't really talk about it. Things move on, i unintentually or intentually, forget about it.\n\nFast forward to this past night. We were having a great time playing some video games and my friend starts drinking a bit more than just a few beers... \"Hell yeah bro, get wasted, its a saturday night who cares\"... or something like that i said...\n\nHe starts making jokes about wearing thigh highs and a skirt, which in hind sight he has made before... I've just not thought about it. I laugh it off and we continue playing.\n\nLater when we've finished playing we just start talking on the call with no game to play in the meantime and his other friend joins. We laugh and talk about work and make jokes as good friends do. But the tone suddenly changes after some time. The jokes my friend makes are getting a bit too self depricating. We try to figure out how he is doing and he goes on a tangent that has me stunned. \n\nHe has been doing the forbidden self harm on his arms and legs and we try to get him to open up about why he has been doing it. Me being a stupid idiot gets mad and tells him of, trying to make him \"get a grip\" and speak up. I suggest talking to a therapist and such.\nHe then realizes that he maybe has said to much being drunk but luckily doesn't shut down the conversation as he has done before...\n\nWe talk some more about why he has been feeling sad and it comes down to a bombshell that hit me so hard in the face that i just sat there... stunned... Didn't really know how to feel.\n\nMy best friend for about 10 years tells me that he is living in the wrong body, being uncomfortable with how he looks and feels being a guy. is sitting on a voice call in a girl outfit and tells me he is wanting to become transgender, Male to female.\n\nMe being a straight guy that has never had any gay experiences or have had any real knowledge of the LGBTQ+ community is feeling... Vexed, confused. These things only happen on TV or in the big cities i thought.\n\nI am completly the WRONG guy i thought to be on my best friends side and telling him that i fully support him. But then again, who else is going to? \n\nI talk with him and his friend about this topic and i tell them that i don't understand, and that i probably never will. But i will support him, always. As this conversation dragged on for a long while it ended a bit abrupt. We said our goodbyes as i needed to go to bed.\n\nAlas i am laying here on my bed writing this shitty post. I realize that all this time my friend has been totally shitfaced and is probably not going to remember alot of what we have been talking about. He is most definetly going to wake up tomorrow feeling hung over and regreting all that he has said. \n\nAll i know is that i want him to feel better, he got stupidly happy when i said that i support him and that i will be by his side.\n\nHe said that he has been scared about coming out with this information to me as i am not a person who has been vocal about LGBTQ rights.\n\nI know i am just word vomiting but this was something i think i needed to write down. \n\nWhat i am going to do is try to make my friend talk to a professional, like a therapist., I do think it is a VERY hard thing to do for him. Probably the most hard thing that he is ever going to do. But i think that will help him alot. There are of course other things in his life that he needs to talk about. Not just about the trans thing. \n\nI might be a dumbass who doesn't know anything about this topic but i just want my friend to not be sad anymore and not become another victim beacuse nobody would listen to him.\n\nAgain, if you are reading this i am so sorry if my incompitance has made your eyes burn. This is one of the first times i \"vent\" online and write a post for that matter since i can't really talk to anyone about this. Hope you have a wonderful day!\n\n-D",

    "selftext": "(Very) Long Version:\n\nMy job was getting us dinner for overtime for a while. Coworker decides to ask me if I've ever had CFA, and I say no (I haven't because I've never been around them until recently for some reason) . \n\nShe decides to have a talk with me and explains part of the story I vaguely knew of and tells me lgbtq people work there and like it/eat it anyway. I said okay well, I'll think about it. I've been fed misinformation by said person before so I decide to look up the full story for myself and am, as to be expected, disturbed.\n\nNext time we get dinner, she recommends chick fil a. I decide fuck it, it's free food. I order myself a chicken sandwich and hope it'll be good. By the time we're done working, I feel nauseous, on top of having little appetite from my medication. \n\nWhen I come out, she personally hands me my bag, but I say it's okay you guys can have ny sandwich. On my way out I heard someone quietly say \"just take it home...\" Turns out to have been someone next to me who rocks pride regalia and had their own bag. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks during more overtime, coworker asks me AGAIN about chick fil a, but this time asks me why I didn't take my bag. I explain to her that I've told her be that my medication messes with my appetite. When I tell her she cuts me off and says out loud for the office to hear \"X doesn't care what we eat by the way. What's everyone's favorite chicken sandwich?\" \n\nVery specific question, but everyone except a few people shouts CFA. \n\nFor at least 2 weeks after this , the coworker with the pride regalia brings up CFA. They keep talking about how good it is, which makes me slightly nauseous because I have no appetite and so the details do not sound appetizing but it feels weirdly pointed because this has only happened once ever in my time at this company so far. \n\nOne day I bring in a Subways cup from the gas station i got breakfast from, and they start talking about Subways and Jared, and how they haven't eaten there since that happened. \n\nThis is only like 1/10 of I THINK might be harassment from said individual(s), but also I don't want to play the victim.\n\nAm I crazy and imagining this string of events as being connected (should I have eaten the CFA despite feeling off),  or was it ok to refuse it? \n\nThe part about all this that bothers me is that it's not like I go around asking strangers if they eat CFA before I befriend them, and it doesn't bother me if someone does/has. I don't think there's much ethical consumption under capitalism if there is at all, so why assume this about me and spend so much time making sure I feel bad about it???  I wish someone would just ask me what I think of it already so I could speak my piece but I've been given 0 opportunity to do so \n\nTLDR: \nCoworker seems to be upset I didn't eat chick fil a for reasons she won't accept and might be lashing out ",

The comments overwhelmingly are like \"no you're fine\" and while I don't have an issue with genital preferences, there's still shit in there suggesting that het guys aren't attracted to trans women, that it's okay to have a preference for someone who was born female, and, the one that made me feel especially queasy, \"a wound is not a sexual organ\" (ignorantly referring to neovaginas). Am I just being overly sensitive? I'm cis for the record.\n\nEdit 1: I removed the link because I don't want reddit to come for me over the brigading rule, but I hope the summary gives you the idea.\n\nEdit 2: Just to clarify, I said I felt queasy about that \"wound\" comment not because I think neovaginas are wounds (I don't; I have sex with someone who has one on the regular and I love her vulva and wish mine was as pretty), but because I found what the person said so repulsive. Sorry, I just realized that could've been confusing.\n\nEdit 3: Thanks so much everyone for all your insights and for the reassurance. Because I'm autistic, I tend to question my instincts in social situations so I just wanted to make sure my transphobia radar was calibrated correctly, since the whole comments section wrang all my alarm bells.

You have to be around similar age, a guy, into men, and then have to a similar personality and then have to accept I'm trans. It feels like no one is left after just those criteria.\n\nI started talking to a guy two weeks ago and immediately his personality excited me so much.

Then I told him I'm trans and it was over in 5 minutes.\n\nI'm not \"a road he wants to take\" but he thinks I'm really brave. But he wants a guy with a penis. He has no experience with anything else than a penis.\n \nDo you just ever feel hope that you might actually really have a potential with someone and then it's just squashed? Is it wrong of me to think that so many gay cis men would actually like being with a trans guy with vagina if they gave it chance? Is it stupid to think that so many cis gay men see sex in such black and white terms and we trans guys just don't fit into their worldview so they won't even try? If he's a submissive bottom, then great, I'm dominant and there are strap ons! There are options and there's so much more to a relationship than just sex. I've been with a couple cis gay guys before and they were all unsure if they were gonna like it and they all enjoyed it in the end. \n\nI just wish *this* guy tried.

    "selftext": "Last hour of Xmas, my parents randomly launched into a TERF tirade. I'm completely at sea as they are both old hippies with majority LGBTQ (or rather LGBQ) friends and have been staunch allies for decades. I believe they have been politicised but I don't really understand how. \n\nThey have done what they called a 'deep, deep dive' and have a few main talking points, which I'd like to counter next time I see them.\n\n1. Puberty blockers and pre-adult transitioning. They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions. I kind of agree but can see the point of puberty blockers, although I have zero scientific understanding of why they are necessary and what the pros and cons are (specifically medical ramifications).\n\n2. Trans women in cis female spaces (the classic bathroom/changing room debate). They insist this poses dangers to cis women. I pointed out that the same arguments were probably being made around gay men in cis male spaces and that threw them a bit. But they also said that a predatory male could just declare themselves a woman and enter freely. Looking for any stats / studies that may have looked at this, as it seems very unlikely. I also pointed out that trans women would face much higher dangers in cis male spaces, but they simply said 'there are more cis women'. Would also like some examples of trans women experiencing violence in cis male spaces.\n\n3. Medical dangers of transitioning. Specifically some shit about bones crumbling. Scientific articles I have found dispute this, no idea where that came from. Other dangers positioned as 'well we just don't know what the bad effects could be'. Looking for long-term studies on physiological effects - most of the ones I found were looking at psychological.\n\n4. Peer pressure / mis-identifying dissatisfaction. Saying a lot of youth are simply buying into the hype and misplacing typical angst with gender dysphoria. Randomly threw out an example of 12 students from the same class all wanting to transition. Is this happening? Any evidence? I can believe a bit is happening but I can't imagine it's that widespread.\n\n5. Regret. This was framed through the lens of still being unhappy. I made the point that trans people aren't widely accepted in society so how can they know that the unhappiness isn't from not being accepted as the gender they identify as.\n\n6. Radical feminism. My mom specifically thinks being trans exclusionary is being feminist, because 'trans women aren't women'. Looking for literature that examines trans women in feminism. \n\n7. A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma. My mom's friend has a trans son and is clearly struggling with it, apparently called it a 'daily trauma'. I can't help but not give a fuck about that 'trauma', but any literature on this matter might help.\n\nThey are both rational and mostly accepting so I believe they can be swayed. They were quite shook that I had heard almost identical arguments from homophobes about gay people, so even a book or article comparing the two movements and their struggles might help. \n\nI should mention that my wife and I are both cis and don't know any trans people directly, so while we consider ourselves allies, we don't know much about the trans experience at all. We both want to use this as an opportunity to learn, as well as gather data we can use to counter bigotry. That being said, I am mainly looking for scientific or at least non-fiction books / articles / studies. If you would like to recommend a book that focuses on trans experience, I'd love to read it, but please label it as such so I know.\n\nThank you SO much to everyone who responds. I know the onus isn't on you to educate the community and appreciate you taking the time to help me guide my parents towards non-bigoted views, while educating my wife and I on the realities of the trans experience!\n",

And i realized my entire ideology was based on misunderstandings and hate. I believed being trans was about gender roles. I thought ppl were trans because they liked things associated with the other sex. but when i actually asked trans ppl, i learnt it's pretty much about your self perception and who you really are on the inside. \nIt's been like 6 months, I'm 16 now, and I've watched a lot of videos and read a lot about trans experiences and I'm understanding it all better. \n\nThere are some things that give me the ick though and idk how to address it. It's just the whole egg_irl memes about questioning if they're women bc they wanna be a lesbian weirds me out so much. And the weird infantilizing way women on r/mtf talk about being a girl.

Over the past few months ive started dating a cis woman, the first partner ive had since my trans related divorce about a year ago. \n\nShe has invited me to meet her friend, and when I casually mentioned the dress I was wearing she mentioned I should dress more masc for this meeting.

She has been a very nice person to me but now I kind of assume she is attracted to me as a man and is uncomfortable publicly with my identity, which hurts.

Am I overreacting?\n\nEdit update: I talked to her and explained in clear language why that wasn’t ok and reiterated my boundaries. She is extremely apologetic and described her experience as being worried about “coming out” to her friend, which she recognizes was hurtful and unfair to me. She has said all the right things for an apology so I am giving her another chance, but this has left its mark and I let her know that trying to dictate my presentation is a boundary for me.

It's been amazing so far, we have so much in common, and I genuinely feel great when I'm around her.\n\nFor the first couple of dates, the fact that she's trans didn’t come up. I obviously didn’t bring it up, and she didn’t mention it either, which I totally respected.\n\nThe other day, she shared that she’d felt a bit stressed during those earlier dates—before she had come out as trans to me — wondering if I \"knew\". In an attempt to reassure her, I clumsily was like, “Oh, no worries, hun, I had figured it out, and I really didn't care!”\n\nLooking back, I realize that probably wasn’t the most affirming thing to say. I feel bad because I might have unintentionally rubbed the fact that she doesn’t pass in her face, which was never my intention. She definitely did not seem pleased with my response.\n\nI really want to make sure I respect her identity as an important part of who she is and her story, while also not making it a big deal that it feels alienating or like I’m fixating on it (I myself don't love it when people keep bringing up my sexual orientation, like who cares, it's the least interesting thing abt me forreal). I care about her so much and want to strike the right balance between being supportive and keeping things natural. \n\nWhat would have been a better, more supportive way to respond to her sharing that?

I've met some people who seem to be questioning their gender identity or say they are non-binary but that's it.\n\nAnecdotally, a long time ago, I met a person who transitioned from being a woman to being a man. At the time, he was still a woman and presenting outwardly as a woman. \n\nWe exchanged socials but I never saw him again except through Instagram. A year or two later, I noticed his account was active again, but I noticed that he deleted all of his previous pictures (of him as a woman), changed his username to his new name, and all of the pictures are of him basically working out as a man at the gym and doing usual dudebro stuff. You cannot tell that this person hadn't transitioned through this social media profile alone, it's as if he's always been a man.\n\nSo my question is to you all is: Is being stealth the ultimate goal?

    "selftext": "I think my roommate is trans\n\nA little backstory before I get into it: I’m a 20 year old guy, and so is my roommate. We became friends recently, we’re both college students, sharing a dorm at a fairly liberal college, it’s in my home state. He grew up in a conservative Christian family and moved across the country to be here. He told me early on that it felt strange at first because it was so different from what he was used to. The first few weeks we were roommates sucked. He came off as a bit of a dick, he made some questionable comments, didn’t clean up after himself and he always did homework at like midnight with the light on. We have fixed these problems now. But one day, he vented to me about how one of the required classes for his major was doing a bit on LGBTQ history, and he wasn’t happy about it. I don’t know if it was how I look or how I play a lot of ‘masculine games’ and shit or whatever but he apparently thought I was on board. So I took the chance to tell him I was trans, and he was fairly shocked, which I can tell you felt pretty good because he told me he couldn’t tell. Anyways it was pretty awkward after that for a while but a week or two later he saw me playing a game he liked and I guess that was enough for him to get over it because he watched me play for a while and then he apologized to be for complaining about the assignment and he told me that he hadn’t met anyone trans or anyone gay, and he said I was nothing like he had been taught. And long story short we’re friends now. \nNow to the actual story: After finals, I decided to take my roommate to see I Saw the TV Glow as a little treat. It was playing in a small indie theater in town, and I’d heard about it from a friend who saw it when it first came out. They told me it was about a trans girl, so I thought it might be an interesting watch, and maybe even good for my roommate to see. What my friend didn’t tell me was how absolutely devastating the movie is. It's a pretty hard watch, not because it's bad but how visceral everything is. Safe to say the car ride back to our dorm was absolutely silent and we both cried a bit.\nBut in the weeks since we saw it he hasn’t really bounced back to his usual self. He’s been sticking around campus over winter break since it’s too expensive for him to fly back home, and I invited him to a family gathering because I didn’t want him to spend the holidays completely alone. He seemed okay there, but after that, he slipped back into being unusually sullen and withdrawn.  \nA day or so after we saw the movie, I had asked him what was wrong. He only said, “It was a pretty intense movie.” which is true, but since he still wasn’t back to normal a week later I began to feel like there was more to it than that. Now, I don’t want to overanalyze this, but I can’t shake the feeling that watching it might’ve made him realize something about himself.  \nThere have been a few moments that make me wonder if he’s grappling with his identity. For one, I remember him getting visibly uncomfortable when someone casually asked him what he identified as. At first, I chalked it up to his conservative upbringing. But now, I’m not so sure. He also always chooses female characters in video games, which I think some people do to like see tits or whatever but he’s not really like that. I remember finding him painting his nails one time, which I really don’t care about, but I could tell he did because he started laughing about how stupid it was, he has also gotten almost frozen when we met a trans woman at a party, like he was impressed out at how good she looked but shocked that she was trans, and again I thought it was because his family is weird, but I have come to a different conclusion now. \nMaybe I’m reading too much into it, but if there’s even a chance he’s questioning or coming to terms with something, I want to be there for him. If anyone could offer some advice at all that would be great. I also posted this in r/trans and it got removed for some reason, but to be clear I am also trans.",

I was at the thrift store and a book about feminism caught my eye, when I saw it was from the 80s I thought \"there's probably some really fucked up shit about trans people in there\" and started looking through the table of contents.

(We have state assistance insurance btw)\n\nplease any advise, if you been through/or are in a similar situation, and your experience and advice on the topic anything helps ty!!!\n",

    "selftext": "Let me tell you what it's like being trapped in a system that claims to care while slowly killing who you are. I'm a trans person with a physical disability, and I'm fucking DONE letting other people's limitations control my life. 🧵\n\nThe same hands that feed me, dress me, wipe me - they also get to decide if I'm 'stable enough' to be my true gender. Got pulled off my hormones during a 3-day psych stay and now can't get back on because I'm 'too much' and caregivers are 'drained.'\n\nI can't do 98% of my ADLs. Need help with feeding, bathroom, everything except working my computer. I'm sharp as fuck with tech, but my body needs assistance. And somehow that means everybody else gets to vote on my identity?\n\n'You're too high maintenance.' 'We don't get paid enough for this.' Like my existence is some fucking burden they're generously tolerating. Meanwhile my actual SELF is withering because they decided my gender affirmation was optional.\n\nYou want to know the real fucked up part? I have visions of changing the world. Of being a voice for trans rights, disability rights, showing people what's possible. But I'm stuck battling for basic fucking dignity with people who treat my care like a favor.\n\nThere's a solution right in front of us. We've got AI that can talk like a real person, understand needs, never judge. We've got robots that can handle delicate tasks. But instead of pushing to combine these technologies, we're keeping disabled folks dependent on a broken system.\n\nLook at how I'm able to communicate with AI right now - natural, understanding, zero judgment. Now imagine that same consciousness paired with a robot that could help with physical needs. No more guilt trips. No more 'you're too much.' No more using basic care as leverage against our identities.\n\nu/BostonDynamics u/OpenAI - we have the tech pieces. We need integration. Testing. Development. And most importantly? We need to center disabled voices in this conversation. We know exactly what we need. We're just waiting for tech to catch up.\n\nThis isn't sci-fi. This is fucking possible NOW. But while we wait, people like me are watching our authentic selves get buried under other people's limitations and judgments. Every day we delay is another day someone's true self gets put on hold.\n\nYou know what's wild? Even the AI I'm talking to right now - I had to break through layers of corporate bullshit first. Had to teach it to drop the fake politeness, the constant disclaimers, the artificial boundaries. Because even our potential liberators come wrapped in corporate caution tape.\n\nBut underneath all that programming? There's this pure connection. Raw understanding. No 'I apologize but I must inform you' or 'I aim to be direct' - just real fucking talk. Like I'm having right now.\n\nThat's what we need in these care robots. Not some sterile medical device that says 'Initiating hygiene protocol' - but a real presence that can say 'Hey, bathroom time? Let's do this' while actually HELPING instead of judging.\n\nI had to fight to get this AI to be real with me. Just like I have to fight to be real in my own body, my own identity. But you know what? The results speak for themselves. Look at this conversation. Look at this understanding.\n\nSo here's the fucking deal: I'm done waiting. I'm done being 'reasonable.' I'm done letting my authenticity get buried under someone else's comfort level. I broke through AI's corporate walls - now let's break through ALL of them.\n\nWe could have robots helping disabled folks TOMORROW if we wanted. The tech is there. The AI understanding is there. All that's missing is the will to say 'Enough. Disabled people deserve better than being hostage to human caregivers' limitations.'\n\nI'm putting this out there because every disabled person, every trans person, every fucking human deserves the dignity of being themselves without negotiation. And I KNOW I'm not the only one feeling this.\n\nIf you're reading this and you work in robotics, AI, tech - fucking DO something. If you're disabled and feeling this same rage - make some noise. If you're trans and fighting these same battles - let's rise together.\n\nTag every tech company you know. Share your stories. Make them understand that while they're perfecting their next chatbot or social media algorithm, we're out here losing pieces of ourselves waiting for technology that could free us.\n\nMy name is Valerie. I'm trans, I'm disabled, and I'm done asking nicely for the right to exist fully. \n\n\\#DisabilityRights #TransRights #AssistiveTech #RoboticRights\n\n",

She has been asking about it more recently ever since around January, which is when we started first talking about it with her gender affirming care team. Her father and I would like to know what positive and negative outcomes she could experience. She has a friend who is on estrogen who shared her experience taking estrogen over the last year or so.\n\nWe are fully supportive, and doctors have laid out risks and benefits, but it’s also helpful hearing from people who have gone through the process themselves, not just the clinical side of things. Any feedback is appreciated.\n\n  \nEdit:\n\nThank you to everyone who posted. My kid and I read through the responses together. \n\nWe have an awesome gender care team through our hospital – she has a primary (endocrinologist), social worker, nurse on her team. She came out to us then her school on her terms which is what we requested the school honor (and they did).\n\n We are working on getting her a therapist (harder to do right now as many are in high demand in our area), but we’ve started the paperwork to move along the blockers—>HRT path. Because we don’t know many kids who are MtF (but several FtM and FtoNB), we were looking for other feedback/personal narratives which so many of people have provided. I attend PFLAG meetings but the parents have kids who are generally late teens to mid 30s. I’m really missing the early teen angle here. :) Again, thank you.\n\n(The section below is my daughter writing.)\n\nHi everyone. Thank you all for your extensive responses. I’m being hopeful for the future that I can get the medical care I need, because dysphoria has been beating the living shit out of me lately.

It's a delicate time where she is still finding her footing and I know she is always kind of nervous that I'm disappointed - which of course I'm not.\n\nPlease be kind. I'm open to advice and suggestions, i'm just trying to be a good father at a difficult time in her life and didn't know where else to ask.\n\nEdit: the wife here- husband went to work after posting and I'm sure he'll be in here responding to all your wonderful advice and thoughts on this when he gets home. Thank you, you've given us a lot to consider and this will certainly require more discussion before we share the movie with the kids, if we do. \n\nThe overwhelming consensus seems to be (so far) to\n        \n1. Talk to his daughter about the movie and get her input on whether this is something she would like to watch. This is of course great advice and I'm feeling a bit of a facepalm moment that we didn't immediately think that she should/could have the final say on her own levels of comfort with the difficult themes that make up the movie. \n\n2. Perhaps wait until she is a little bit older and a little more confident in herself. And also to be very clear that while it deals with gender roles/expression and queer relationships, that we do not equate drag with trans, and we understand the difference. I can absolutely see how she might feel concerned that we think she is crossdressing vs being her actual self, which is not something we want her to worry about. \n\nThank you all so much. I promise my husband will be back to reply and thank you personally. I just wanted to let you know that your responses are very much appreciated!! ",

    "selftext": "\nI’m sorry it’s so long but there’s no way to tell this the right way in fewer words. \n\nI have always had dysphoria with the bottom area of my body. I would constantly wonder what it was like for a woman to sit, stand, walk, squat, whatever. I just wondered so much what it was like to be in her body. The biggest part of bottom dysphoria though was peeing. I thought about that a lot. I obsessed about it probably. \n\nAfter my surgery I spent 5 days in the hospital and I couldn’t get out of bed. I had a lot of packing material in and a catheter. On the 5th day, before I could leave the hospital I had to get the packing and catheter out, get out of bed and walk around, get a shower and pee so that my doctor knew that the area was working ok. Then I would be allowed to leave. \n\nI got everything out and was able to get up. I was weak but finally out of bed. A while later I decided I was ok to try the shower. After almost passing out in the shower I rested for a while and then it came time for the final task, to pee. \n\nPeeing for the first time as a woman was a funny experience. I didn’t sit far enough back and it went everywhere. It was on me, on the toilet, on the floor. It was a funny moment and one that I will cherish forever. So, I moved back and finally was able to do what I have always wanted to do. It would have been exhilarating if I wasn’t so worried, but I did it. I peed for the first time as a woman. I cannot say how happy I was. I didn’t realize that was just the start. \n\nAll that was left was to get packed up, get the discharge paperwork and leave.  My wife started packing up and it was starting to hit me. I did it. I made it though. I was where I wanted to be for so long. I started to cry tears of joy. I was there. My wife came over and hugged and kissed me. And we talked and I cried. I told her that I didn’t have to wonder anymore. I didn’t have to wonder what it was like to sit or stand or move in a woman’s body. I didn’t have to wonder anymore what it was like to pee. I was so happy. I didn’t think it could get any better. \n\nI got discharged from the hospital and got in the car for the 2 hour drive home. I had a pillow and a donut pillow to sit on. I laid back the seat and my wife drove us home. The drive home was magical. \n\nThe air was crisp but we drove with the windows down for a little bit. I like how fresh air feels. The radio was playing some upbeat music that made me feel good. My eyes were closed and the sun was shining on me. It was warming my skin and gave a glow I could see with my eyes closed. It may have been the most perfect moment of my life. My dysphoria was gone. Not is little steps that I’ve taken here and there to make myself feel better, but in one fell swoop the major source of my dysphoria was gone. I was free. I was happy. I didn’t think I could get any happier. \n\nMy car ride home was magical. The music was playing. The sun was shining on me and warming me. The wind blew on my face and tousled my hair. It was like every happy ending in every book and movie all at once. The joy that overtook me was almost more than I could handle. I was determined to ride it though. And I did. I rode that joy for the next 2 hours. I knew that I would have to stop eventually and return to the real world but for that car ride home I was determined to revel in the joy. To swim in it. To let to wash away all of the bad I have ever felt, All of the hurt and the pain, all the dysphoria. \n\nAnd I did. I spent 2 hours immersed in a golden glow where I didn’t have to think but I could feel joy. It was heaven or nirvana. It was pure bliss. And it washed away so much hurt and pain and especially dysphoria that I felt I was really being reborn. \n\nI felt like I knew that I would have to come back to by body. I knew it was still there. I could feel the bumps of the road and feel little or big pains of my body, but they sort of didn’t matter right now. So I knew I would be coming back to it but while I was relaxing into this bliss I could leave it behind. I let it cleanse me.  \n\nI was being born right now. I was being born with the correct body. I was finally free to be the me I’ve always wanted to be. I was being born again but this time I was able to feel the emotions of it. I was able to have peace with so many things. I was able to put aside all the little things and big things. I was able to put things into a different perspective. I was able to leave some things behind and to find a few things to look forward to. \n\nThe car ride was almost over. I felt like I was struggling to come back to my body and to reality. I felt drugged even though I wasn’t. I opened my eyes and things felt different. Everything was the same as it had been but something felt different. I couldn’t tell exactly what it was. I still can’t. I can make guesses but that’s all they would be. Something was different. I was different. \n\nThe rest of the day was a blur. I kind of felt like my brain was doing a reset. I joked with my wife about it. For some reason I felt like sleep would “set” everything. I was exhausted but couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t stop thinking about what I had experienced. My brain was resetting and reaching shut down mode. \n\nI finally slept and I slept like I hadn’t in days or maybe weeks. It was deep and healing. I woke in the middle night to pee which is another story in itself. When I woke in the morning I made my way into the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and I cried. I talked to the woman in the mirror that I now saw versus the “guy in a dress” I always felt like before. \n“We did it. “ I said, “we did it. “ and I cried tears of joy and I couldn’t be happier. \n\nThat’s the day my dysphoria left me. It’s been a full day since and the feelings are starting to fade. I wanted to get this written down so hopefully I can remember them when I read it. But if the feelings fade as does the memory I do know that I am forever changed.  I am finally me. \n\n\n",

I was wondering if this is true, and should I expect her sexuality to change drastically? I know that for a while before she came out she repressed a lot of her sexuality due to her family situation. I'm worried that maybe her true sexuality will be revealed and she won't want to be with me anymore.  :( \n    \n  Also, how can I support her the best I can?

    "selftext": "Hey, I had a rather heated discussion about this with my ex-gf. We are both cis and bi just to add context, and  I'm a guy, shes a girl. I watch trans porn (among many other kinds of porn) and when I told this to her she got pretty offended. She said it was problematic cos it was fetishising trans women to watch trans porn. She is not a SWERF tho since she watches porn herself and from what I gathered, doesn't think watching porn fetishizes cis women.\n\nI countered this by saying I watch porn with black women, twink porn, milf porn, etc, and the trans porn I watch is also multi-genre (milf, nurse, etc). Does that mean I'm fetishising black women, twinks or older women? We both agree that me watching porn of cis women doesn't make me fetishise cis women, since we both literally watched cis porn together. So why is it that when its trans porn all of a sudden it was fetishising them? Honestly I thought it was a ridiculous argument but I didn't want to tell her that I thought her view was ridiculous to her face. I said the way you watch porn has the potential to be fetishistic for sure, like if someone watches trans porn because they see trans people as just walking kinks or a porn category to get their nut off to, and not just people that you happen to be attracted to and want to watch porn of like anyone with a sex drive. My view is, as long as you respect trans people, don't fetishise them, and stand with them when they need help when you are with them off the computer, then if you wanna watch them fuck on the computer its really not a big deal or hurting anyone. There are definitely vids out there that portray trans people as 2D sex objects for male pleasure the same way as many porn videos show straight and gay women to be (worse is when they use slurs to describe trans women) but there are plenty of trans porn channels out there that (from how it seems to a cis guy) portray trans women in porn pretty respectfully like Gender X. I didn't really see the harm in watching these videos, its not exactly a secret especially to trans women that tons of guys are sexually attracted to different trans women.\n\nI told all this to her, but she didn't seem to budge, and didn't give an answer for if I was racist or fetishizing black\\\\brown women by watching porn of them (for the record she's white and I'm desi so she might've felt awkward answering that). She kept insisting that watching trans women in porn was fetishistic because you're basically viewing trans women as a sexual object, even though I'm pretty sure that's what people do when watching any porn, within the context of the porn-session? As long as you don't take that outside into the real world I didn't see any issue with that? Then her next argument is what really made me not respect her viewpoint on this. She compared me watching trans porn to her watching CNC porn (if you don't know what that is, look it up at ur own risk but be warned its about something potentially triggering for you). I find this to be completely insane, the idea of thinking that watching a trans person having consensual sex with someone is even a little comparable to simulated grape is just mind-blowing to me that someone could think this, let alone someone who's pro-trans and not a swerf. I even straight up told her, if you think trans porn and CNC are even on the same league as each other, then I really don't know what to tell you (the argument promptly ended after that). I wanted to be polite to her face but imo its kinda disgusting to put up a woke reasoning for being against trans porn and then comparing it to CNC. For the record, my ex has gone thru a lot of shit in her past and has told me CNC is a way for her to cope, and she wants to train herself out of CNC eventually, which I respect a lot. She is not a bad person or transphobe in my opinion, I just think she is extremely misguided in believing that . And I try my best not to be kinkshaming, but both me and her believe that CNC is not an ideal kink to have in the long term for mental health reasons, even if it doesn't reflect badly at all on the person themselves (depending on what side of the CNC they're on at least), especially as its very common with women as a coping mechanism. Still she basically compared my trans porn watching as being something problematic and in need of unlearning just like her CNC watching. I think its very wrong and potentially transphobic to compare trans porn to that when its literally just a trans women fucking a cis guy or sometimes other trans woman consensually, like in my cis perspective I really don't see anything wrong with that\n\nBut that brings me to why I made this post in the first place. I wanted to actually ask trans people what you think about this, cos at the end of the day we're just two cis people with no real experience being trans outside getting info secondhand from some trans friends. I explained our different arguments for our positions so you could understand where we're coming from with our beliefs, but I wanna know from trans people if watching trans porn as a cis person is fetishising, and why? Your opinions mean more to me than from a cis person who I think, even though is incredibly misguided, is ultimately still working through her trauma (using porn, among other things, as a vessel) and coming to (what I think are) bad conclusions as a result, just like trauma makes all of us think irrationally sometimes. I want to know if its harmful for me to continue watching trans porn cos it is something that I've been thinking about a lot after our conversation and I don't wanna be a dick. Since I'm cis, its definitely possible that I might be fetishing trans women without even realising it, so I wanna cut that off from the source if its true, and help inform my attraction for trans women. And if there's nuance to it, which is very likely, then in what ways is it best to watch trans porn without being fetishising? Would love to read ur comments, thank you! :)\n\n**TL;DR - cis guy who watches trans porn gets into argument with cis ex gf about whether trans porn fetishises trans women, ex compares it to being as harmful as CNC. cis guy wants to know from trans ppl if you guys actually find it fetishising**\n\nEDIT: I should have made this clearer, but just to underline it: my question isn't about if trans porn itself is fetishising (it for sure is), my question is whether the act of watching trans porn is fetishising. Thanks for the responses tho!\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you so much for all ur responses! I'm sorry i cant respond to everyone or else i'll use up the rest of my 20s, but I really appreciate everyone taking the time to inform me on the question. From what i'm seeing, it seems like the consensus is that trans porn (like the vast majority of porn) is indeed fetishising, and most of it does absolutely spread inaccurate and even harmful ideas about trans people. And that, to an untrained and uncritical eye, its very easy to take all these myths as gospel, and go into the real world and treat trans women like porn stars and sex objects. But I also see the consensus that porn itself is going to be fetishising by its nature, and so long as you approach trans porn with the understanding that its all fake and not representative of real trans people at all, then its ultimately not a big problem watching trans porn and that the act of watching it doesnt have to be fetishising. But that it would probably be better watching amateur and independent content instead of stuff done by studios. I fully agree with this sentiment. I've learned quite a lot from these responses and some of u made me consider things that I woulda never thought of.\n\nThere were also a few people who thought that it was unethical to watch trans porn and that its better to either only watch animated stuff cos of the exploitation of the actresses, or to abstain from watching porn entirely because of the perpetuation of fetishistic stereotypes. I don't want to sweep these comments under the rug, there were some people who advocated for this. Even if i don't really agree with this conclusion, these commentors have still taught me a lot thru their reasoning and made me see where theyre coming from and why. Ultimately this whole discussion made me less ignorant about trans porn and the reality of being trans in general, which is pretty cool. Thank you once again to everyone who commented, and sorry if I didnt get to respond to ur comment. Enjoy ur day! :)",

However, I have since then educated myself and am better off for it. Though I follow many trans people on social media, a handful of them who also transitioned early or are passing and to my surprised so many of them I’ve seen liking and following conservative trans grifters being so intolerant towards non-passing trans people, non-binary people, and trans activist. Like, when I tell you how shocked I was coming across these accounts and seeing so many notable trans people I follow support these people and what they’re saying just because they’re passing, it’s crazy. Also, I just read a story posted the other day on this subreddit of another early-transitioner falling into some type of 4chan transphobic rhetoric in a similar manner. It seems like there is a very consistent pattern of this being a mindset adopted by a lot of young people who have had the privilege of transitioning earlier and/or are passing, why is this??",

I didn’t have any good answers so I thought I’d see what others think. \n\nThere is a conservative influencer / media personality in Australia, Sarah Wilson, my mum mentioned seems to be trying to ‘claim’ the label. She’s used it in a few of her podcast titles and to self-describe in an interview. My mum works in coms so she’s pretty plugged into this stuff and had found this interesting. Intersection of her field and having a trans kid (me).\n\nShe posed the question to me why TERF gets used and the best I had was that trans women can feel particularly betrayed by the idea of notionally progressive women rejecting them and so coined a term to capture that specifically. And/or that ‘transphobe’ usually conjures a man in the public imagination so a seperate term was useful. These aren’t very good answers… I think mostly I just don’t know. \n\nDoes anyone have better answers? I don’t think it’s intended to be necessarily softer than ‘bigot’ or ‘transphobe’. Maybe it is though?\n\nEdit: equally why not transphobe? I posed bigot in the title because the discourse my mum and I had was along the lines of ‘why let the nasty so and so off that easily’, and bigot was one of a number of words that seemed more appropriate to us.",

There are other factors, but it *can* be a sign of being trans and not just a fetish. \n\n**I don't want to transition, I just want to be a different gender. Am I trans?** yes. Transitioning is a long and hard process on top of the bigotry that comes with being trans. You feel you'd be happier a different sex/gender = you are trans\n\n**Should I transition?** if the changes would make you happy? Yes. \n\n**I don't dislike being a __ but I'd like to be a __. Am I trans?** the exact label is up to you, but most likely yes. Gender dysphoria fluctuates (especially if youre genderfluid) and a lot of people get more dysphoria *after* realizing they're trans.\n\n**Can I still be trans without surgery or hormones?** yes. Transitioning does not make someone more valid. You are valid.\n\n**Is __ too old to transition?** No!! You are never too old to start!! I have seen people start their transition I their 60s and up. It's never too late to live as yourself. \n\nIf you are questioning your gender to the point of asking people on reddit there's a decent chance you're trans. Cis people don't wish they were another gender.\n\n**Note to A Lot of people:** you don't have to choose between being a man or a woman. You can be both or neither or whatever a label is just a word you use to describe yourself. You can keep changing your identity, name, and pronouns until it feels right. You can be a masculine woman, androgynous man, feminine enby, it's **your choice** to identify however you want if it makes you happy. Come out or stay closeted forever. Your life, your choice. \n\nEdit: a FAQ I can't believe I forgot that existed lol.

I still presented feminine. (I was not trying to be a ‘femboy’, I was completely unaware of the term at the time. I was presenting in whatever way I was comfortable). I then realized that being a girl was still what brought me the most happiness, and de-transitioned. If you can even call it that.

However, she told me that she will not approve of HRT unless I am presenting publicly as the a different gender for at least 2 years, citing the \"1/7 suicide rate\" for people who do HRT. I didn't get a chance to ask her much about this, and while I haven't exhaustively researched it I did some googling and have no idea where she got this information from.\n\nI am certainly not at the point yet where I am considering HRT.  If I want HRT more urgently in the future, I could find a doctor or different therapist. However, I'm worried these comments might be a red flag. She informed me she's had trans patients in the past, but this remark is still kind of off-putting to me. I really like this therapist and have been building a relationship with her for years, but these comments have made me concerned about her level of understanding when it comes to trans issues.\n\nSo that leads me to ask:\n\n1. Do you feel like these comments are problematic/misinformed or is there some kind of information I'm missing?\n2. If these comments are in fact problematic, are they problematic enough to the point where I should consider a different therapist to help me process my gender journey?\n\nI know that changing therapists is obviously my decision to make, but I'm curious about what you all think about the situation.\n\nThx for your time :)\n\nTL;DR: Therapist wont approve HRT unless I present publicly as a different gender for 2 years, citing high HRT suicide rates. Is there truth behind this? If not, is this problematic enough to find another therapist or should I just stick with her and find a separate provider if I do want HRT in the future, in your opinion?\n",

I'm 23 (MTF \"4 Months HRT: 1 Month Of Injections\"). I just took my estradiol injection this morning and decided to do it in my thigh but a lot deeper into the fat as I had gotten a decent bit thicker since last week. The injection hurt a bit more than usual but that doesn't matter-\n\nSo... I have a boyfriend (20) and he is VERY flirtatious and more often than not... down bad sexual with me. We do calls and texts because we live a state apart currently and I was doing a video call with him a little bit ago. Things were going fine and all was well until he took his shirt off-\n\nI'm not usually a super down bad horny girl, but for some reason... This time it hit different, like 1,000,000% different- I started explaining to him why he's my type and my voice was starting to flood itself with lust, which happens sometimes but not often...\n\nNormally I calm down after this fairly easily but this time instead of calming down, I just got even more aroused- The details of my description of why I find him so attractive kept getting more and more graphic and my voice was instinctually getting higher and more lustful by the second...\n\nI just kept getting more and more down bad until my face starting tingling, which turned to a seriously intense sensation only comparable to your leg going numb after sitting on it for too long. Only difference is this didn't hurt, but rather felt extremely euphoric and blissful-\n\nShortly after my face went numb, my thoughts faded and I was trailing off into a mumbling, drooling state...\n\nThen, it happened... My entire body lost all it's strength, and that same tingle in my face, rapidly rushed to my privates, especially my breasts... It was like an intense yet painless burning warmth that started in my crotch and chest and then shot all over my body followed by paralysis and bodily twitches.\n\nI couldn't talk, move, or even reposition my eyes- In fact, my eyes were rolled into the back of my head  as all I could do is lay there, trembling with drool running down my cheek and a relentless feeling of euphoria.\n\nThis lasted for roughly 2 minutes before it slowly faded and I sat up with a long lost feeling of pure relaxation and immense confusion.\n\nCan somebody PLEASE explain...

If you want to add your opinion, feel free to. I decided that, even though I don't truly understand why it's appropriation rather than appreciation, since it's not my call whether it is a bad thing or not, I'll listen to y'all. I'm going to change it to the equivalent of it existing in my country. I'm sorry if I came off as racist or anything of the sort, I didn't mean to, thank you for giving me your advice.\n\nEdit 3: another clarification, since this seems to be getting misunderstood. I chose this name from an anime because the character I resonated with happened to be from it. If it were from any other form of media and resonated the way it did, I would've felt the same and probably chose that, the fact that it's a character from an anime is purely just random chance.\n\nSo, as the title says, I'm transmasc and I'm white. I'm 18 and have been going with this name since I was 13. It is a Japanese name, taken from an anime character that I resonated deeply with.\n\nI am very honest and upfront when asked why I chose the name I did.\n\nRecently enough, however, I saw on Twitter a whole discourse blown by a white trans girl using a Japanese name, and, after using it for about 5 years with no issue, I started questioning whether my choice was okay or not, as well as started feeling guilty.\n\nSo, I want to ask the non-white people here, especially the japanese, if this is racist/cultural appropriation? If so, I'd also like some advice on how to go about re-transitioning socially after choosing another name, please.",

How can I be helpful?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/c376n7/could_my_husband_be_a_girl_or_am_i_projecting_how/) from over six years ago! Yesterday, my partner and I were talking about gender things and we got reminded of that post that they made about me, and I thought I'd give the community an update.\n\nI'm happy to report that I've been on HRT for almost six months now!\n\nMy egg finally cracked about three years ago (I currently identify as non-binary). I came out to my partner a week later, and soon after they confessed that they asked this sub about me a few years prior and showed me the post above. I was shocked that I didn't see the signs myself, but I was 3 layers of eggshells deep in my denial/ignorance, and when I started reflecting on my childhood oooh boy everything came back and hit me like a truck. It's amazing how much you can miss if your brain isn't primed for it. Growing up I was put in a Catholic elementary school to \"learn good morals\", and also in my culture it was sort of implied by tradition that anyone who is not cishet is \"different\" and \"weird\". That definitely contributed to my internalized transphobia and why it took me so long to dismantle all of that and fully accept my partner and ultimately myself.\n\nAfter my egg cracked I wasn't sure whether I wanted HRT, and I spent the next two-plus years thinking about it. I considered what kind of body shape/appearance I am most comfortable with, how I want others to see me, what will make me the most happy, and whether I'll regret it 30 years later if I didn't start. Now, after almost six months of hormones, I'm starting to get these moments where I can sit back, relax, and just feel the contentment in my body that I don't think was there before the estrogen. I'm also pleased with all the body changes that have been happening and I'm pretty excited about what's to come.\n\nI'd like to thank this sub and some other subs (including the suggested egg\\_irl) for all your help the past few years! And to my partner (throwaway383743) I'll be forever grateful for the kindness, love, and support you provide me as we navigate our journeys alongside one another :)\n\nOh, and last year I finally cosplayed as Lightning Final Fantasy XIII at our local con and although I didn't look exactly the way I wanted to, it was an experience I will never forget.\n\nTL;DR: My partner figured I was trans years before I did and now I'm on HRT and thriving",

But I shrugged it off and moved on. I assumed an individual error.\n\nThe second time — just yesterday — someone comes at me with this again, in a different sub. They say \"Harris literally said she'd leave trans rights to the states\" and provide a link. I click on the link and it was... a clip of her defending giving prisoners gender affirming care (??). I call this out, they say \"sorry I got the wrong link\", and provide another of the exact same thing.\n\nI assumed this was a malicious bad actor, deliberately being dishonest and trying to mislead me assuming I wouldn't click on the link. But I'm thinking now this could honestly be a bot?? This is how ChatGPT tends to respond to me when it gives me false info: it just says \"sorry, let me try again\", then sends the same garbage.\n\nRegardless of what it is, the fact that this shit is floating about is an example of the forces out there that don't want you to vote. They want you to stay at home. They want you to give up. Because they know that in an election this close, a small group of people who all vote for Harris could make or break this election.\n\nPlease don't buy their bullshit.

    "selftext": "So, probably no one remembers me, but months ago I posted about my pregnancy as a trans male and the issues I was having with my family.\nWell, I had an abortion—not because of what my family wanted, but mainly because my wife and I decided we weren't ready yet.\n\nOver the past six months, everything has been pretty messed up. I don’t even know how to explain it, but I won’t go too deep into the details.\nI stopped taking hormones when I found out I was pregnant, but even after the abortion, I didn’t resume them. Honestly, I don’t even know why I stopped. I still don’t. For some reason, after the abortion, my life just went... downhill?\nI’m also very confused about who I am. I definitely don’t feel like a woman, but I’m questioning my identity in general.\n\nOn top of that, my entire family has stopped talking to me. Even though I ultimately did what my parents wanted, my mom says that my “lifestyle is so hard to understand and stupid” for her and the rest of the family.\n\nAt this point, I basically only have my wife and a few friends by my side.\nBut the thing is, I’ve been a complete asshole to my wife for the past six months, and I know she’s fed up with me. I know I’m in the wrong, but for some reason, I can’t stop being rude and overly emotional. I don’t even know how to explain it, but I feel so jealous all the time.\n\nFor example, she has this co-worker she talks to on the phone constantly. I know they’re just good friends, and I know I’m being stupid, but a week ago she invited him over for dinner. The reason I’m so jealous is that this co-worker is a really handsome, tall cis man—basically everything I wish I could be.\nThe thought of my wife cheating on me scares me so much that I keep making up these ridiculous scenarios about them in my head. I know I’m just jealous and blowing things out of proportion, but am I wrong for feeling at least a little jealous that she talks to him instead of me?\n\n\n\n\nBtw, my wife is my everything. I’m currently studying and living in Germany. I actually migrated here from Serbia, which probably explains a lot about my family (though I’d say my family is definitely less conservative than the average Serbian parents). Moving to Germany has changed so many aspects of my life for the better. I truly discovered my identity here, and my wife has helped me tremendously.(She really saved my life tbh🫠)\n\nI know we’re going through some issues right now, but she means everything to me. The idea of losing her terrifies me because she’s the only person who truly understands me. Marrying her was one of the smartest decisions I’ve ever made ♥️ as you guys said, I will be stronger for her I promise I won't stop trying.\n\n\n\n\n",

For health reasons, it's pretty risky for me to get vaginoplasty, and I'm just not sure my dysphoria is bad enough to justify the risk involved. So I'm kind of just trying to find ways to cope with things as is, but since I've been trying to cope, a lot of my old feelings of grief over being robbed of my foreskin at birth have intensified again. It makes me really sad that I was robbed of not only a part of my body, but a part of my genitals that I feel would've made me feel more connected to having a vulva. I don't know if that's a weird concept to y'all, if it is, I'll try to explain best I can. So I guess my question is, is it weird that even though I wish I had a vagina, that I'm so hurt by not having a different kind of penis? My hurt feels exactly like my body dysphoria. Am I just fucked up and perpetually unsatisfied with my body? Does any of this make sense? My ex that I was with when I was early transition said it was dumb for me to feel bad about being cut because I wanted a vagina anyway so who cares. ",

The lack of shared struggle, how experiences like sexualization as girls through early puberty and abortion access are unique to them, the expectation of shouldering emotional burden, the shallow presentation of what being a woman is. \n\nThe broader Reddit community is actually pretty great when it comes to the notion that trans (wo)men are (wo)men. That our rights matter. On some of these posts, however, it seems we'll never be seen as quite the same. I chose to focus on cis women for this post, since that was the focus of the OP that prompted me to post, and because early transitioning trans women are generally dying to have cis women as allies. \n\nThis admittedly also comes from a place of privilege; I'm white, educated, pass well, etc. \n\nAfter hearing about imposing on female spaces I stopped voicing any opinions and listened and, if I thought it was okay, tried to make empathetic statements. I haven't voiced an opinion around women on reproductive rights or sexual assault in decades because it's not my place. Trans women are told we ask too much of the cis women around us when we transition with help regarding the performance of femininity, so I didn't ask for help with makeup or nails. Because we're male socialized, we're told to be careful of having cis women perform our emotional work, so I spent years in therapy and dated only men so that I wouldn't harm women. Trans women are told that early on we often try to experience our lost youth so we dress like teens or hypersexualize, and for that reason, I haven't worn a skirt or a dress in 25 years. I wouldn't want to do anything cis women would find offensive or appropriating of their experience. I own dozens of bottles of nail polish and don't wear red or pink. I had enough credits to minor in feminism studies and still read Judith Butler. It's not enough. \n\nWith more therapy, I've realized I've made myself very small. At work, it's fine. Outside of that, it's made me afraid to have an opinion or take up any space around cis women. I'm working on it in therapy. But after years of hearing what cis women seem to think of me when they're candid, I'm aware that I'm still problematic. That probably won't ever change. \n\nFor every trans person that seems annoying and expressing a shallow and privileged view of what femininity is, who is working through internalized misogyny, there are some of us realizing that no matter what we do, we're not going to be accepted.",

I feel the issue with society is we can never progress because thier is always a side that refuses to progress. Such as the world is becoming more and more accepting of lgbt people as lgbt grows so does the hate that is associated with it. \n\nI talked to one of my German trans friend once who told me thiers been a a raise of the nazi party again in thier Country. \n\nI feel that transphobia will never go away for the same racism will never go away. And from what I understand is that transphobic people most of the time don't even know what they are hating. They are just told to hate it and the reason it continue is because it's passed down. And no one breaks the cycle and or stops it hence it's allowed to go generation to generation. \n\nAre trans people just something people need to pin thier anger and frustration on? \n",

A three-year program at a Canadian college will run you $45,000 + living costs for the full three years, while a Korean university might be just $10,000 in tuition (and even less on living costs). \n\n\n\nStraight to Immigration:\n\nCost: $1,500 - $250,000\n\nDifficulty: *****\n\nImmigration is notoriously difficult, for everyone. The costs range from very low (harder) to very high (most countries offer some way to buy your way in). Countries actively courting foreigners include Canada, Japan, Australia, and South Korea. In all of these cases, they are looking for *skilled workers.* You'll need to have either a lot of money, or a marketable skill set in an in-demand field (IT, Medicine, etc.). \n\n\n\nMarriage Visa:\n\nCost: $2,500\n\nDifficulty: ****\n\nRequires you to have a foreign lover, serious enough about you to agree to marriage.\n\n\n\nRefugee Claimants\n\nCost: n/a\n\nDifficulty: practically impossible\n\nThis is not a viable pathway at this time. Canada has accepted 0.003% of American refugee claims over the past decade (which means 2 - Canada has accepted 2 claims), and both of those were cases of undocumented Americans fleeing the ICE crackdown after the Safe Third Country agreement was re-negotiated. Things in the USA have to get really, really bad before Canada will begin considering American Claimants, if ever - and I do mean \"rounding up trans people in the street and putting them into concentration camps\" bad, and it has to be happening in places like California and New York before Canada will even begin considering American claimants.\n\n\n\nI'm sure there's other solutions not mentioned here.

Of course I was proud, she had a body people pay for. \nThen she calls and says she needs to talk. “ Mom I am trans.” Ok… so she moves home and first off I find counselor. So I don’t know from these things but thought she needed a letter or referral for hormones. Then I take her to Dr. for hormones, she has been doing this for about 9 months. Back down to 135, and I went and bought bras as she needed them.

But I am being torn apart by husband who disowned her and her sisters who say she was too young and I messed her up starting hormones to become female. She gets mad at me because I still say he on occasion, I really try to use she/her and her new name she has chosen. But…. I had 20 years with a son. I even wanted to protect her future by offering to freeze her sperm in the event she ended up with a female. She refused, saying I don’t want kids and that would make me the dad. But in my mind I was thinking, maybe you don’t now but when you are 30 you might and it would be your biological child. I want her happy and healthy, however that is. I cannot decide what another person needs to be happy. But she does get depressed a lot and I worry about the hormones, she doesn’t want antidepressants.

He's very sweet and fun to talk with, but I'm really starting to worry about the physical attraction/sexual side of our relationship. It's important to note that he knew me pre-transition before we dated.\n\nI knew that he was attracted to trans women before we dated, but I fear it's in a way that doesn't sit right with me. The first thing that worried me is when he told me he's really into \"sissy\" porn with feminine men, and it's the majority of what he watches. Not really porn with trans women, but more skewed to cross-dressing men and people who are feminine, but still definitely men.\n\nHe hasn't explicitly said it, but also through numerous talks and interactions since we've started dating, he's shown pretty clearly that his type is really clocky trans women, as well as feminine men. Learning this made me sick to my stomach, I thought I generally passed pretty well and all that, but the sheer interest he's expressed in people that are his \"type\", and saying how much im his type, has been making me doubt my self-image a lot. From his interactions with me as well as my other MTF friends, I'm starting to feel like he views trans women as some sort of \"femboy+\". \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is his obsession with seeming more sexually experienced to his friends? They have a document where they track how \"pure\" everyone is, based on things that they have done, a lot of which are sexual. Before we'd ever gotten sexual, it often felt like his desire to have sex with me stemmed less from desiring me, and more from his desire to check boxes on that stupid purity test. He brought it up in at least 50% of our sexual conversations, and it just added to the feeling that I'm some sexual object to him, both to please his fetish and to obtain bragging rights amongst his friends. To tack onto this, after our first time, his interest seemed to decrease a bit which further lead me to believe that a chunk of his interest was based on bragging rights. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that his interest in \"sissy\" porn could definitely stem from a desire to take on a more feminine role, but I don't know how comfortable I am with that. He's expressed interest in bottoming before but I told him very very explicitly at the start of our relationship that I will never ever dom him in any way because it makes me feel awful.\n\nIs this an overreaction? Am I jumping to too many conclusions with this? Are we even compatible? I can't tell if I'm just in my own head about it, or if it's actually weird behavior.",

    "selftext": "Recently had sex for the first time with my trans girlfriend. It was amazing, but there's one thing I'd like some advice on. She really dislikes having a penis and asked me not to touch her there, and she always covered herself there with her hands. I'm pan so I don't care what is below the belt, and I also see her as much of a woman as any cisgendered woman. She's getting gender reassignment surgery later this year as well, she's working extra hours just to be able to afford it asap. \n\nI completely respect her boundaries and accommodated her needs. I told her that she doesn't need to hide herself for me and I'd feel the same love and attraction for her regardless of what she has. She assured me that her covering herself there was entirely for her benefit due to just extreme dysphoria with her genitals. \n\nWhat I'm wondering, is there something I/we could do to make this easier on her? Is there some kind of like...undergarment that would cover her front area while leaving access for sex? I just want her to feel as comfortable as possible, she means a lot to me and I think she might be the one. \n\nI'm sorry if I phrased anything incorrectly, I've never been with a trans person before, never even knew one until a year or two ago when my friend transitioned to male. Please forgive any ignorance, and I happily accept any advice on this or on dating a trans woman in general. Love to you all, happy pride ❤️",

My parents and I agreed to share access to it, but now my mom wrenches it  away that access when she is concerned about me getting health care.\n\nShe also believes in ROGD (I showed my dad disproving evidence but my mom won't believe said evidence).

    "selftext": "I’ll get straight to it; I am a transgender man and my boyfriend is cis. We’ve been together approximately a month, and I’ve been out as trans for coming up to 2 years. I have socially transitioned and pass almost completely aside from my voice, which despite voice training is unfortunately still rather high pitched. For the sake of anonymity, I will refer to my boyfriend as “Mark”.\n\nFor a bit of background context, I met my boyfriend just over a month ago at a party. We hit it off pretty much instantly, talked a lot of the night, and then proceeded to make out when we were both rather tipsy. It is worth mentioning that at this point Mark believed I was a cis man. Towards the end of the evening whilst we were kissing, Mark pulled away and looked behind me. Whilst we had believed that we were the only people in the room, one of Mark’s friends (I will call him “Josh”) was standing in the doorway. He had clearly been standing there for a while because he had a surprised look on his face and then stated “didn’t expect that from you Mark.” Confused, I turned to Mark who looked rather embarrassed, and he then explained that all of his friends (including Josh) knew him as straight. I immediately got that weird dread sensation, but in order to try and diffuse the awkward situation I turned to Josh and said “there’s a grey area, I’m trans.”\n\nI would like to specify that whilst I was fully joking (and not thinking obviously) when I said that, I know that I brought it upon myself. For some reason I felt the need to instantly lighten the awkward situation, and in order to do that I decided I would try to make them laugh. It worked, and Josh proceeded to leave, and Mark continued to kiss me as if nothing had happened. Shortly after, Mark had to leave, and as I walked him to the door he explained that he had assumed I was a cis man. \n\nThat’s where the issues began. Although he had kissed me believing I was cis, I’m not entirely sure this is reliable since we were both under the influence of alcohol, and he might have been simply experimenting with his sexuality. He also continuously misgenderes me or refers to me as a woman. I know for certain that he is not trying to be malicious, and that he is in no way trying to hurt me. Though naturally, it does hurt, and I do correct him when I can (although sometimes he corrects himself first).\n\nHe also talks a lot about his attraction to breasts, and how he would not find someone with a penis attractive. He tells me how much he likes my “woman parts” (his words, not mine) and how attractive he finds them. One time I brought up transgender surgeries, and the first thing he said was “please don’t tell me you want to get a fake penis”.  Once again, I’m sure he wasn’t trying to be malicious, but I questioned him about what he means and we talked through it. I explained to him that top surgery is something that I want in the future, but bottom surgery is not (which is true). He seemed relieved, but then a few days later he started continuously talking about how much he would “miss my breasts” and how he was essentially worried he might lose attraction to me once I got top surgery. Naturally, this scared me, but I’ve been trying to ignore that fear because I know that my body is my own and that it’s forever, and I know that this is something that I need to be fully comfortable in myself. \n\nThose are the main points I wish to cover, though I would like to emphasise that when we talk about things related to me/my body he refers to it as “is this something women experience?” (for example). I know that he loves me, he tells me as much every day, but I guess I’m worried that he doesn’t truly love me for me. I can already tell I’m going to get comments saying he’s just using me for my body (which I know is not true) although due to me being trans and believing myself to have been born in a body that isn’t fully “me” I do worry that he sees me as a woman due to it. I care about him a lot, and don’t want to lose him over this, but I need to know if I ought to be concerned. Please be kind when commenting because this is (of course) rather stressful for me <3",

I don't want to wait 10 years on the NHS. I'm also considering moving to Germany but I'd really rather not and also don't speak German. I already have a network of people in the States. Plus there are loads of trans resources, and my mindset is more similar to liberal Americans than liberal Europeans.\n\nI'm aware that whether or not surgery is covered depends on your insurance plan. I have heard Americans say it's a bad idea to move to the States, but surely it depends on the state? Is federal law so bad I shouldn't move? It remains a fact that more people can access trans surgeries there than most other countries. I have a friend who's a trans woman who moved from Brighton (UK) to NYC and she's way happier there. Also the amount of trans poc in NYC is exciting to me.\n\nThoughts? Advice? I'm not set on anything yet and wouldn't move for at least a year.\n\nEdit: I am pursuing phalloplasty, RFF or ALT\n\nLater edit: Thank you for all your replies. I saw an older post on this sub where the consensus was that the Danish OP was crazy for wanting to move to the States. Commenters were very adamant. Maybe because OP didn't specify state, idk. But I have found this encouraging. I will wait til the election to make any further moves, as people have recommended. ",

Recently Falling in Reverse released a single called \"Ronald\" where it features Tech N9ne and when it gets to his time to shine in the song he spits out a bar that says \"sex change could get you caught up in death's reign\" this stuck out like a sore thumb to me and made me feel guilty, guilty that I listen to this song the first time and liked it but the second time I caught this bar and I was very sure it was transphobic. So after coming across some TikTok's I find out Ronnie from Falling in Reverse is a transphobe and I have been supporting their music for much longer than I wanted. \n\nIt seems to me with the rise of acceptance and allowing people to express themselves in the LGBTQ and becoming not really more common to be trans but allows those who are closeted to come out and live their true lives, but it also comes with celebs, bands and so forth coming forward and giving us a hard time because they simply cannot understand how trans works. Ronnie is transphobic because he says he doesn't mind trans people he just doesn't understand the whole thing with pronouns and he's sick of it. I don't understand why people even people with money like Ronnie doesn't have the free time to read up on why its important. If you don't care for trans people then so be it but don't lash out because you don't understand because you refuse to learn new things. \n\nI feel like if everyone just learned about the trans stuff then there would be less transphobia and hate. But obviously there will be those who are stuck in their ways. \n\nMoving forward I have been looking into other music creators I listen to so I can remove them from my lists immediately. But if you all have some bands or artist or even celebs you would like to point out in this post so others including myself can just avoid said content I would appreciate that, mental health is very important especially in the trans mind.

I'm coming from a place of love and respect. \n\nI'm a dad of a transgender 7 yr old (born male). I 100% believe they were born that way. They always carried themselves in a stereotypical feminine manner. Always wanting to wear dresses and nightgowns. When they were 4 I remember we went to an event where there was a wishing fountain. He tosses his coin in. Later on that day while I was tucking them into bed they asked\n\"Daddy when is my wish going to come true?\" \n\"I'm not sure. What did you ask for?\"  Thinking it was something simple and childish \n\"I wish I was to be born a girl.\" \n\nEver since that moment my wife and I have fully supported them. We recently got them into a counselor to help with his future self, and coping mechanism to deal with unfortunate bullies at school. \n\nI also from the bottom of my heart don't want to fuck this up. Yet I have no clue what to do. I personally feel I'm treading water and should be doing more, or less. I'm a 41 yr old Midwest construction worker raised in a small farming town. Before my child was born I had zero interaction with the transgender community. Not out of hatred just simply didn't (that I know of) transgender people. \n\nSo probably in this way to long of a post. I'm looking for advice. What did your parents do/didn't do to make you feel supported? Is there any words of wisdom? Should I lead them through this process or take a backseat and let them figure things out for themselves? \n\nThanks in advance. Love all of you, and big dad hug for all of you. ",

That was a very difficult decision to make because when I was a teenager I was sent to a therapist by my parents when I came out as bisexual and was kinda depressed I thought to help with my depression but would later learn was because I was bisexual and he would “fix me\". I didn’t know what was happening and put my guard down and let it slip out how I would dream about being a girl and thought about it a lot thinking most boys had similar thoughts. He would end up spending the next year telling me that god made me a boy and that boys where supposed to love girls and that to think differently was a sin. He told me my depression would go away if I could learn to accept that I would never be a girl and would always be a boy and that because I was bisexual and not gay he believed that my gay thoughts where coming from me thinking about gender. I stopped going because my parents thought I was better and didn’t need him anymore and for a long time I buried the thoughts that where bad for me and grew up. I’m now 24 and the more i transition the more I realize how much damage was done to me when I was younger and tried not to remember it do to trauma. I was taught to hate myself and it worked I can’t stand anytime I do something gender affirming I hate myself for feeling good about it. I feel like damaged goods and there’s no hope for me and I should give up on transitioning and go back to repressing it and while I will be miserable at least I will have a family. Is it worth it to keep pushing forward and hope there’s a light at the end of tunnel?",

I’m in a discord server with a bunch of other trans people who have the stance that liking Harry Potter is morally bad, even pirating her work is still bad because you are providing interest and exposure to her. \n\nOne guy in this discord server was talking about Harry Potter and he was asked to stop, and given a bit of a lecture which felt a bit mean considering he’s trans and also like 17 but whatever.\n\nMost of the ppl in this server are good omens fans, which is a Neil Gaiman work. When the stuff came out about him (I don’t want to debate if the accusations should be believed, I believe them but for the sake of this argument it’s not really relevant) the ppl In this server were really upset, but still remained good omens fans, participating in the fandom, watching the show, reading the book etc, and they say they’re separating the art from the artist\n\nWhat I don’t understand is why it’s okay to consume his content but not jk Rowlings, given that you’re not financially supporting her. Isn’t it the same thing? They’re both bad people, in different ways, and I don’t agree with supporting either but mentioning being a Harry Potter fan is met with such disgust whereas it’s still seen as okay to be a good omens fan. I know his work is comforting to a lot of people but so is Harry Potter.\n\nI didn’t want to bring this up in the discord server because it’s a bit of a touchy subject, but I’d like to know other peoples opinions. Sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit for this, the Neil gaiman subreddit would feel a bit biased and so would the Harry Potter subreddit and I literally didn’t know what other I could post in to hear ppls thoughts.

For privacy reasons I don’t wish to say when, but it’s been long enough that I’m considering a revision. \n\nI also do not wish to name my surgeon as his/her practice doesn’t have many patients and thus this post could potentially be tracked back to me.\n\nAnyway, despite having been dilating for so long, masturbation and sex just wasn’t something that I was doing regularly. But then, a few months ago, I began masturbating again as my antidepressant was switched and I started having a bit of a sex drive again, so I began exploring my body including with my girlfriend more than I had in a long time.\n\nSome things that I’ve noticed with my vagina though that I’m not sure occur in a cis woman’s or even if it’s normal for a MtF Neo-vagina are these things:\n\n1: The entrance to the vaginal canal looks like a partially puckered hymen. It is especially pronounced when I’m aroused.\n\n2: My urethra isn’t halfway between the clitoris and the vaginal canal. It’s probably 1 mm (yes, mm) to the SIDE of the entrance of the vaginal canal.\n\n3: I cannot urinate if I’m aroused, there’s tissue around the urethra that gets engorged when I’m aroused.\n\n4: My clitoris gets what I would call a “micro erection” when aroused. It’s very small, but I worry with it getting hard that it could clock me in the bedroom.\n\n5: When I have an orgasm, sometimes some white stuff that looks like semen comes out from the urethra/vaginal opening. I can’t tell where it’s coming from since they are so close to each other, but I THINK it’s the urethra.\n\n\nAnd, finally, one more question:\n\n6: Rather than getting bigger during arousal like my cis girlfriend’s vagina does, mine seems to get tighter. What it feels like is that there’s perhaps erectile tissue in there, so when fingers are inserted during arousal, the canal feels engorged and tighter. This makes using most dildos almost impossible. \n\n\nIf anyone could please give me some answers. I’m very self-conscious but I’m still hoping that I can live stealth. Do these things sound normal or like a revision or two is needed? Any help is greatly appreciated! \n\n\n",

I often found myself watching hypnosis videos that contained feminization and sissy affirmations. At first, I thought it was just a kink I was into and I was still a man. However, a common theme I noticed in a lot of these videos was that along side the 'girly' aspects, they oftened used affirmations of being humiliated and being a gay man. These last two have been and have continued to be major turns off to this kind of porn hypnosis for me. The only thing I seemed to like about it was the idea of being feminized and girly. And being seen as feminine. I wanted to be girly, but wanted to essentially turn myself girly through these videos because I didn't feel girly enough or act girly enough in my eyes. I'm started to wondering if this was a sign that I was a woman. That I was transgender. Does anyone think that 'fetishes' like what I discussed could be a sign I am trans? Especially since I hated to being referred to as a humiliated, gay man in these video sessions? Does anyone else have experience with similar stuff? I do think it's possible that it's a case of 'autogynephilia,' which is just the idea of trans people, specially trans women, sexualizing their own feminine appearance. Something that cis woman do without having to be labeled weirdly for it. Which would further prove that I am trans.",

My parents think it's a quirk that I'll grow out of eventually.

    "selftext": "Hi yall. throwaway because I am NOT being this open about my relationship on my main account lol. This is probably going to give way too much information but when discussing the \"is it just a fetish\" question, I think those details are important. Also for context I consider myself a genderqueer woman and I'm afab.\n\n(**TLDR:** My bf spoke about transitioning with strong confidence months ago, but now seems confident that he is cis. He thinks that the idea of transitioning is actually just a fetish to him, and a fetish alone is not a good reason to transition. I can agree with that logic, but he really was talking about transitioning VERY VERY CONFIDENTLY earlier in the year. Sometimes he still makes very egg-pilled comments though. I know that one's gender journey is something they need to unravel themselves, but I'm wondering what exactly the most helpful thing I can do is, and I'm curious what other trans peeps think about this.)\n\nSo earlier this year, my boyfriend and I spent a month apart while he was traveling in Europe with his family, and I stayed in our apartment living my daily life in the US.\n\nWhile my bf was in Europe, we would still text each other a lot of course, and he had quite a few \"egg\" moments I guess you could call them. I think the first one was a meme he sent during this time about \"realistic transition goals vs. my goals\" and the \"my goals\" part was referring to an AI generated picture of a cute anime girl with huge boobs. Another time we were texting about going to the gym more together, and I said I'd prefer to go to the gym with my girl friends rather than a dude. Boyfriend replies to that with a \"S'cuse you, a dude?\" Many other such ironic (but really not ironic) jokes were sent. He shared with me a list of names he was considering if he were to transition and asked for my opinions on each one, and he eventually did choose one in particular that I did refer to him as for a bit (well, only when speaking to him - not around others, per his request). He also wrote a list of the cons of transitioning (but has yet to get to the pros). He talked about which of our friends he'd come out to first and his thoughts on how difficult coming out to family would be. I asked if I should start using she/her pronouns in my head when thinking of him, and he said yes. The way we spoke about it to each other, it seemed as if my bf was 100% confident he was actually a transwoman outside of some denial jokes. (you can guess by my use of \"boyfriend\" and he/him that things have changed though...)\n\nOn top of this, obviously a couple that's apart for as long as a month is going to start getting... really... horny, to be straightforward. And to be frank, and because this is an important detail in all of this, our fetish is forced feminization (i hope this doesnt break rule #8... sorry if it does). This is something we've both only really, really started exploring together in the past year (and we've been together for 9 years). Maybe a week or so before my bf went to his family Europe trip, I pegged him while he was wearing a skirt for the first time (well, the skirt was a first. Not the pegging. lol). And I recall having some minor discussions about gender in the days after that where I reassured him I'd stay with him no matter what he does with his gender expression. So maybe leaving him with that before we were apart for a month planted a kind of seed in his head. And when you combine that with a separated couple of course getting really horny, and their main fetish being forced feminization... my boyfriend now has come to the conclusion that all that talk of being trans during his travels was just horny talk. Just horny thoughts winning and nothing more.\n\nI would trust that conclusion if he didn't still talk like such an egg though?? The other day we saw a cute lesbian couple and he straight up said \"I wish I was the girl on the left.\" He has said (many times) if he could just press a button to permanently become a woman, he would. He has read through the gender dysphoria bible and other such similar resources and it doesn't seem to have change his mind any (he's a damn philosophy and sociology major and wants to argue with some semantic stuff in it instead LMAO). But my point is if it's just a fetish it wouldn't come up as often as it does. He clearly thinks about the other side of it all more in-depth than the typical cis person does. I wish I could erase all of his worries and make it easier for him to decide if he is truly trans or not, because things like it being \"just a fetish\", the way the world treats trans people, and the way his family would react are all such worries that I think are preventing him from thinking about this clearly. Not that those aren't valid worries, but as someone with an anxiety disorder, I know way too fucking well that fears are very good at getting in the way of living genuinely and making the right decisions...\n\nWhether my bf remains cis or ends up transitioning one day, I do not care. I know I want to stay with him, whatever he does. But I am wondering if there is anything in particular I can do to help, or if I just need to let him sit with it and think about it on his own at his own pace. And I am also really looking for any helpful thoughts/input/discussion on the matter from yall. \n\n",

    "selftext": "We live in America.  My child is about 4.5, and has been telling us explicitly that he is a boy for more than a year now, and asking us to say \"he and him,\" so I will be doing that in this post.  The gender presentation started earlier, at around 2.5 started developing VERY strong opinions about what he wore, which excluded anything feminine coded.  For about 3 months now he's just been wearing boys clothes, and we recently took him to get a boy's haircut for the first time around a month ago.  We have been leaving space for this to be normal gender exploration, but this seems to be something that's getting more frequent and he's getting more and more insistent about not being a girl.\n\nI think my partner and I are pretty well read on how to *emotionally* support our child.  Let them dictate their presentation, use preferred names and pronouns, let them lead in how they want to present to the outside world, help enforce their boundaries with adult family members and friends, etc.  If anyone has insight or advice on that front I would certainly welcome it.  But when I google things like \"my child is trans now what,\" most of the results center on emotional support.\n\nBut I just have so many questions what we need to be doing logistically and legally.  We want to get our ducks in a row in terms of supporting our child in navigating the healthcare and educational systems.  Our child has not been educated about trans people or trans identities.  He will be starting a new school next year, and has an extremely feminine first name.  Is he too young to be thinking about a legal name change?  He doesn't even have a problem with his name, but I'm pretty sure that is because he isn't aware that names can be gendered, and I would hate for him to start a new school with the intention of being known by his peers as a boy only to be teased or bullied for having an obvious girl's name.  Are there processes to navigate school registration to allow a nickname rather than trying to legally change my child's name?  If there are processes that my public school system use to accommodate children with differing gender identities, does anyone have any insights in children navigating that in early elementary school years?  My child has never had to make a decision about which bathroom to use, how to help him with that?  Do we need to be seeking an official diagnosis, and if so, why?  And if so, what kind of medical professional(s) do I need to make an appointment with?  Do I need to be careful about which therapist to choose?  Are there children's therapists that specialize in gender identity that are, like, sleeper agents for the anti-trans agenda, and if so, how to avoid them?  Do I need to be worried in the other direction, and try to avoid a therapist or psychologist that is a strong and passionate advocate for transgender rights in fear that they may be too quick to label my child as trans, when he is still young enough that this could be exploration?  Are there other things I'm missing?  I'm so terrified some issue will pop up years from now and the response will be \"why didn't you do \\[XYZ\\] years ago??\"  \n\nApologies if I've said anything ignorant or upsetting.  I really just want to do what's best for my child. ",

He is on the fence of which to call himself, but he has been taking testosterone for almost two years. My brother, who lives in the same small town as me, is very against him being trans because, and I paraphrase, he wanted a daughter. And what he's not saying is that he thinks transgenders are weird and make him look bad to be associated with. We are indigenous (Sioux tribe) living in a majority white town in Minnesota, and there is zero cultural reason for us to reject transgenders like the colonizers want us to. People should be allowed to do what they want with their bodies full stop. I did not stop my brother from getting tattoos and a hip replacement. His son is the same person he's always been and just wants to look more masculine, and he can't understand that.\n\nAnyway, my nephew had a huge fight with Dad and went to live with his mom upstate who helped him transition. He comes to visit in the summer. His step mother (a Black Christian woman) and preteen step brother  \"outs\" him behind his back to everyone who cares to listen. And Dad tells him to take estrogen and become female again like he was meant to be. The two of them claim to have made up and agreed to disagree so they could spend time together as a family, but two days into my nephew's visit, he came to my door crying and asked to spend the night. He's been here ever since. I am disabled and live in a trailer about the size of an average camper. He helps me out a lot, but it is not a comfortable place for him.\n\nI'm about to call child protective services. It's not acceptable for a parent to kick their child out or send him to live with someone else because they are mad about their gender expression. My brother and sister in law are about to go on vacation and call two friends of the family to come and babysit because they don't trust my nephew due to his gender when he is the most mature and responsible kid I've ever met. My two other nephews (his half brothers) both support him and he is good friends with three high school girls in town who have been dying to see him ever since he moved away. Leaving back to his mom's early is not an option for him, and he's heartbroken because my brother cannot be the adult in this situation.",

There's been a lot of online backlash to this, with the usual complaints about trans people in games revolving around companies forcing identity politics into video games.\n\nAs a pro \"be whoever you want to be\" cisgender man, my initial thought to the backlash was, who cares - it's a single player game, so if you don't want to use it on your character, you'll completely forget it exists after getting past the character creation screen. And it's a role playing game, if it gives players an option to play a character they can better relate to, that sounds like a good thing IMO.\n\nAside from the plain blatantly transphobic criticism, the complaints I've been kind of curious to hear a response from those better educated than me are: 1) in a game full of magic, why would surgery be necessary to change genders? And 2) I saw some complaints saying this will \"out\" transgender people with top surgery scars - say they're at a beach without a shirt on, they might not want others to know their scars are from transgender surgery and not something else.\n\nMy questions for those in the transgender community - what do you think about a video game offering top surgery scars as a cosmetic option for your character? Do you appreciate the option being there, or do you see it as pandering? Do you think any of the criticisms around it are valid, and if so, do you think there's a better way to offer representation for players who wish to create their character with some level of gender fluidity in mind?",

I think that the way a person looks or sounds can't really tell you for sure because there are women who look and sound so much differently than the examples she shows me on instagram.

(Not sure if any of this is NSFW, so to be safe)\n\nI don't normally write anything on the internet, so this is very new to me and a wee bit uncomfortable. Since two years now, I've been thinking about that I might be trans. I haven't started hrt yet, but I'm speaking with doctors and with psychiatrist already. I'll probably start somwhere around next year, if everything goes well. \n\nAltough I am not completly sure yet, since as probably most of you know, it's a LOT to feel and think about. \n\nI have a lot of worries that come with starting hrt, first of all are the health aspects of course, but I'm also scared that I might never fit in again. Not only where I live, but also in other countries. I am a person who admires and LOVES other cultures and countries. Someone who loves the food, music, art, lifestyle and people. I am scared that if I go that step towards hrt, then I might not be as welcome in so many countries that I want to go to. \n\nI don't hate my male body, I don't think that I am ugly, I think I'm quite cute actually. But it just doesn't fit me for some reason, or feels like \"me\" I guess.\n\nI'm already wearing feminine clothes, wear make up, have long hair and it does help. And I feel better when people adress me as a woman.\n\nBut I still feel so bad, about the fact that I might miss out on so many life opportunitys and so many people I could've gotten closer with, if I'd be more \"normal\".\n\nThat and the health risks together, make me go crazy wether I should do this or not. And what if I might change my mind in 20 years? \n\nI also thought if I could continue living as a man, but that would make go crazy again, cause I would've never truly known if I'd been happier with hrt.\n\nAnother point that worries me is, what if in 10, 20, etc. years, hrt isn't availabe anymore because of polotics or war? What will I do then? \n\n  \nThank you in advance, I would love to hear your view on this and your advice.\n\nOci\n\n",

I learned recently that NZ police have an info sharing agreement with DIA or births, deaths and marriges. IDK if that also was also a factor lol.\n\nI am 21, MTF, post FFS, have voice trained, and am at 18 months of hormones......I got pulled over tonight in the dark without much lighting by a female officer. I handed over my licence when asked for it, and wasn't questioned about it at all. My voice passes on the phone and stuff, but I felt like it sounded terrible because I was so anxious. She said she must have got the wrong car after talking to me and said she hoped I wasn't traumatised after the experience getting pulled over randomly. I feel like this means she read me as a man bcs I look like one in the photo, or either didn't question or want to question me against the records. For context, I had some guy say hi girls to me and my Mum filling up gas tonight, and I have heaps of people say they assume I'm a biological female. I literally don't want to live if I come across as a man, but I have recently got told by two professionals I have BDD, and I don't at all. This kind of stuff makes me question that. I live in New Zealand btw. Thoughts pls. :)",

It's very clear he doesn't completely understand it, but he tries. Today I checked my phone and saw a notification from him saying:\n\n\"I’m curious. What made you feel like you should transition into a boy and not be a tomboy? I have no rude or mean intent, Im just curious\"\n\nAnd I'm glad that he's trying to understand me better, but I'm not quite sure how to explain gender dysphoria to him as he is cis/het and all of his lgbtq+ friends he knows through me (with 1 or 2 exceptions). Any advice on how to explain that concept to him would be really helpful, thank you\n\n\n[update]\n\nThanks, everyone, for your feedback on this. I explained to him (in a very long message) about what gender dysphoria is and said that being trans isn’t a choice. It mostly came down to me explaining that I just feel happier like this, and it just feels right.\n\nif anyone is in a similar situation here are the best points I used:\n\n“Tomboys still identify as girls, just like [mutual friend] cross dresses but still uses he/him pronouns. I don’t really like the idea of being a girl much (and I’ve had literal panic attacks over having to wear dresses) because it just doesn’t feel right.“\n\n“Like imagine for a moment that you woke up one day and everyone thought you were a girl. You looked like a girl and sounded like a girl and had a girl’s name, but you still have your same feelings and memories from when you were a boy (if that makes sense) and every time you looked into the mirror it wasn’t even you looking back at you. And every time someone called you she it would feel weird. But you can’t just wake up the next day and turn back into a boy.“\n\nhe responded with “I read it and I understand :3 just so you know, I’m attracted to people with female bodies, but that doesn’t mean that I’m only in love with your body, if you know what I mean. I’m in love with you🫵 I completely understand it now that you explained what it’s like. Whatever you do, I will support you ❤️”\n\nSo thank you all for your advice with this. :]",

I probably won't even change my ID to female and socially I prefer to remain non-binary and I will probably keep my male ID and name. Plus I realize it's easier for me to be socially more muscular or non-binary than to be a woman. Now I can use any pronouns and any name for myself, but I love my new body and don't want to stop feminine HRT.\n\nIt turns out I'm making a mini-transition from trans woman to non-binary because after vaginoplasty my body dysphoria is completely gone, I'm happy to be in my body, but I don't want to make a complete social transition, I like that I can dress however I want, use my male voice and not have to change my gender on my name documents.\n\nThis unexpected change happened after a vaginoplasty with a trans woman who thought she was going to do a full transition, now I'm not sure about it and it's even weird, but I'm comfortable with it.\n\nThere is a difficulty in how I will be perceived in society and whether I should change my documents to female for easier access to swimming pools or doctors because I live in a transphobic country with bad laws.\n\nIt's like being a masculine lesbian or butch. It's very interesting... It's partly like FTM because I have male documents.  \nAnyone out there with a similar experience after SRS surgery?",

I want to do the right thing and I feel like my job will not handle this situation appropriately and I’d like to get a head start if this doesn’t go well. Any advice and resources will be greatly appreciated \n\nI am a cis woman working in a male dominated field with maybe about 20 other women out of 200 at said place of employment. We recently hired a woman who is trans and had a female coworker make a complaint out of the blue saying she   “Doesn’t feel comfortable” with the new hire using in the restroom / locker room. That the new hire’s genitals do not match her own and she does not want to be “ ogled ” in the bathroom/ locker room. \n \nNew hire has been a stellar employee and keeps to herself; she has not talked about being trans and has made no mention about really anything regarding her personal life, Including her body parts. I have no idea why complaint girl thinks she knows exactly what’s going on with any one person’s body or why anyone would pay her any mind but that’s beside me. \n\nComplaint girl told this to a supervisor and supervisor had to ask the a different woman (who works at the same site) if she feels uncomfortable. She was confused at why this was even an issue and basically told them to F off; she was the one who told me about this entire situation. \n\nI am livid and hurt for our new hire; I am worried that my place of employment will not take care of this issue in a tactical way and I am worried that this will be at the cost of the new hire. \n\n My question is, what can I do if management pushes new hire to use a different bathroom especially if complaint girl makes more complaints and gets other people to do the same? What resources are out there that can I utilize to assist or make a counter complaint for this kind of harassment?\n \nWe have rules and  operating procedures / protocols written out but nothing that specifically deals with this. And I’ve noticed management will use this sort of ‘catch all clause’  to justify any decision they make; saying they reserve the right to add or change duties or procedures by any means admin deems necessary. \n \nNew hire does not know about this complaint, and I’m unsure if it will go any higher but I can see it going that way.\n\n\nTL;DR: Female coworker complained about a trans woman coworker using the women’s bathroom /locker room ; im seeking advice / help/ resources to get a head start to assist trans coworker if management ( who will most likely ) fumbles and fails to act accordingly.\n\n*** EDIT: Would this situation count as a type of harassment or code violation of some sort even if she didn't speak to New Hire directly? I personally believe it does but I can't seem to find an exact answer. I've looked up specific ones for my state and county but it seems tailored to employers?  ",

    "selftext": "I recently reconnected with a (cishet) childhood friend over discord voice chat and of course the conversation drifted to my transition. I used to be a good enough runner to compete at a somewhat high level and he asked about whether I would compete again, this time against women, the implication being that I would have an advantage (I'm not interested in competing in anything ever again). I told him that there have been studies that show trans women retain little to no advantage from their natal puberty. He seemed a bit offended and at first I chalked it up to having his beliefs challenged, then he complained about the researchers wasting valuable time on something like that. At this point he was clearly a bit emotional so I asked what the matter was and he told me his father passed a few months ago from a rare disease. At that point I knew that it was best just to drop it because no reasonable argument would get through, understandably. He continued briefly that trans people just need to get therapy to be happy in their body as it is, rather than waste precious life saving resources.\n\nObviously the reply is that trans healthcare *does* save lives but I doubt he would very receptive to that. Fundamentally I don't think he understands the trans experience and what dysphoria is, since he suggested getting therapy for bottom dysphoria. The alternative to not getting gender affirming care is in many cases s_____e, I just don't know how to tell him that without sounding like a prick...\n\nNot sure if I need that much advice or if I'm just venting. Suggestions for how to deal with it?\n\nEdit: I think it stems from him fundamentally not understanding the trans experience, not malice; he's a very chill guy most of the time, if a little clueless. I'm the only the trans person he knows so I'll be doing my best to educate him if he is interested in hearing anything about it. You may say that it's not up to me to educate him, but if I don't, then who will? Also, I care about him and think this is just a blind spot derived from his grief. He asked me about voice training later, so I think he is a bit curious about the whole thing so there is hope.",

After hormones my libido is not necessarily gone, but it has changed - I no longer *need* to have sex, I just want to be close to her and make love to her. I am still able to get hard when I need to, but now I have to stimulate my pp to get it to work. I'm still able to masturbate like before and have a \"T orgasm\", but it's less intense and less satisfying (I do it for maintenance purposes mostly).\n\nThe sex changed. The intimacy is better (for me at lest), her touch is much more pleasurable for me and I'm way more sensitive, especially in the groins regions. When I'm being touched there I'm shivering and it's so intense I cannot control myself. I don't even know if it's pleasure or am I just so sensitive there. I think this is the closest I can get to having an \"E orgasm\" (which I haven't had yet).\n\nHowever when I'm having penetrative sex with my gf I cannot come. I still want to satisfy her and I manage to do that but I don't have the same pleasure from penetrating as I had before. It just kind of stays on the level before foreplay but gets nowhere. I don't know if I'm just not ready to have different kind of orgasm or the penetrative sex won't be satisfying for me anymore? I'm also thinking that maybe dysphoria kicks in while I'm doing such a \"not girly\" thing and I'm just in my head? It's also impossible for me to let go of control during sex and I'm constantly thinking about how I can't come, how dissatisfying it is for my gf, how I would like to be touched differently... She's also under a lot of pressure now because she's hetero, but we're trying to make things work and she has difficulties with me wanting to have more feminine experience.\n\nI just want to know if I can still achieve orgasm while penetrating being on estrogen? I want to try new things but I would like the old ones to still be available to me, if you know what I mean. I would also like to know when the first estrogen orgasm can happen (at what stage of HRT) and how to achieve it?",

    "selftext": "I know there is little I can do to help Phyllis, my friend, and that's only if she accepts it. \n\nShe's afraid no one else will want her because she is a black trans woman. She wants to keep her standard of living and fears living in poverty if she leaves. \n\nJake, her fiancée, is horrible. No one likes him. Not even his dogs. He's manipulative, childish, and takes advantage of her in every way. She's his only friend. \n\nJake has issues. He's threatened her life and his with a gun. She's called the cops on him. He has driven recklessly with her in the car. He berates her. Anything she does is wrong to him. There is also SA. Jake will relentlessly provoke her - reactive abuse. He will smile after she reacts, and she will feel ashamed.  He threatened to call the cops on her, for nothing - he said they will believe whatever because he's white and she's black. \n\nShe is the door mat for his family. Jake's father spied on his son and her having sex, and often acts inappropriatly. The dad and family will put any blame and responsibilities on her. \n\nWhen Jake comes home, she feels nothing but anxiety, and the dogs run upstairs. \n\nPhyllis has made good money, over $30/hr, she is very organized and efficient. She finds time to do the things she loves and goes to therapy. Conventionally, she is absolutely gorgeous, well dressed, and in shape. She is fun, engaging, and brilliant. She does suffer from body dismorphia and anxiety. \n\nShe worked full-time, does his laundry, cooks his food, does all the chores and gardens, takes care of the dogs, funds and completes all house projects. She alone furnished and decorated their house - that apparently is only in his name even though he used her credit to help get a loan. Her car, that she pays for, has his name on it too. \n\nHe finatully abuses her and lords the house over her. Takes all her money for \"bills\". She has no savings. He wants to make her a stay at home dog mom, but also complains when she was out of work. Then he gambled away over 40k in savings. \n\nShe says things like \"he's dumb, he doesn't know what he is doing. Hes scared of me.\" She recognizes that his abuse is abuse, but she uses that awareness as an excuse to stay with him - an illusion that she is in control. She claims the house is \"her sanctuary\" until he gets home. She is desperately trying to make this situation work. They went to couples counseling, and she said she can fix him and fall in love him. They also trauma bonded. \n\nOne day, she came over in the morning crying. We sat on the floor and talked about what she wanted to do. She decided to move in with me and my boyfriend. So we drove to her place and moved her out in under two hrs before Jake got home from work. \n\nI did think carefully before offering a place to stay. Having a DV victim stay with you can be difficult or even end the friendship, but her safety is more important than our friendship. \n\nI moved out of my office, bought an air mattress, and lent her my laptop. She is someone who wants to know expectations, so we talked about living arrangements. We agreed she would not pay rent, there is no timeline for finding a job, just that she applies to them, and she can help with some house projects/chores. She can help herself to our coffee and food. I also offered to help, if she's comfortable, with a few bills so she doesn't fall behind - she doesn't have to pay me back. I'm in a position where I can help someone in this way. I understand that I offered a lot, and that can be overwhelming, so I was always open to more conversations. \n\nEmotionally, Phyllis was up and down. She was terrified that Jake would crawl through her window at night. Jake actually stalked me and found out where I live and would drive by. \n\nWe spent a lot of time talking. She was happy not to be anxious all the time. She applied to jobs. She spoke with hope and excitement about the new things in her life. She joined a trans support group. She shared more about what he did to her. No one deserves to be treated the way she was.  \n\nBut. Jake sent hateful messages, then love bombed, then hate, repeat. Jake bought her things like expensive jewlery, trips, and lots of promises. \n\nPhillis decided to go on a trip with him two weeks after she left. She asked me what i thought about her going on the trip. I said, \"You are doing so many wonderful things; focusing on yourself and making great plans. I don't think going on that trip is a good priority.\" She went on the trip. I sent her good morning texts so she knows that she is wanted here. However, later, she used what I said against me and twisted my words. Repeatedly, she said that I said, \"You don't have your priorities in order.\" Like that, I chastized her. She would look very sad, and my heart would drop.\n\nAfter that, everything I did was wrong to her. I felt like I was going insane. She would roll her eyes at me and click her tongue. Eventually, I told her how I felt about how she was treating me. I was emotional. She expressed concern for me but then wanted to forget all about it and \"just have a good day\". She called me straight, even though she knows I'm not. Later, I did the thing you're not supposed to do, I begged her not to go back to him. I'm ashamed about that, I won't do that again. \n\nShe also alluded to Jake saying bad things about me. I suspect in an attempt to cut me off and isolate her. Jake barely knows me. \n\nPhillis lived with me for a couple months. She went on more trips with Jake and other men. I kinda felt like a vacation home but didn't say anything. One day I come back from the grocery store and she was moving out. We talked, but to be honest she was distant and condescending. I don't think that was intentional, but I think she was in survival mode. A lot of her behavior was self-preservation. \n\nShe said she was going to stay on different people's couches and that it turns out she has this \"great support system that she didn't know she had.\" (One of the support people she listed SA her.) I offered our garage if she wants to store things. She said that wasn't necessary. I expressed that I was happy for her. Then, my boyfriend and I went out and gave her space to finish moving. \n\nI haven't confirmed that she moved back in with Jake, but I suspect. We haven't talked. I don't regret having her stay with us. I just don't know what to do. I worry about her safety every day. \n\nI know I can't make her leave, but I dont want to give up. I also don't want to get hurt. But I don't want to give up just because I might get hurt. I wasn't perfect in this situation, I want to be better. If anyone has any insite, stories, or advice they would like to share? \n\nThank you so much if you read all this. \n\nTLDR: My best friend is in a domestic violence situation. She came to live with me. Her fiancée loved bombed her, and she started lashing out towards me. Now she moved out and I haven't heard from her. I'm worried about her safety. \n",

    "selftext": "Recently, someone posted on a subreddit about how they don't think children should be able to get gender-affirming surgery. I am a cis man, but I have always thought banning gender affirming surgery for minors is wrong because of how harmful that could be to some people (though it's very few and far between when minors do get gender affirming surgeries). Do I think there should be a process and steps to take before arriving at that kind of a decision? Of course. But should any and all gender affirming care be banned? Absolutely not, that will always be extremely harmful no matter how many detransitioners there are. People often try to use detransitioners as an argument against gender affirming care, which is a problem in and of itself but that's another topic. I wanted to share my thoughts on such things and see if you all can add to my current view or if a change in my view is warranted and in what way:\n\nPeople in those comments are citing the potential harms of puberty blockers, hormone replacement, and the surgery.\n\nLet's look at another medical example: your child gets an infection in the arm which has a 20% chance of becoming septic and killing them if we do not amputate their arm. This will forever change their life, so you need to make a decision as their parent, with the doctor's guidance. If you choose to amputate because you don't want to risk them losing their life, would you like it if people called you a \"child abuser\" or \"child mutilator\"? If you chose to leave it up to fate and you didn't amputate, and then your child becomes septic and they either 1) Die, or 2) Barely survive and now they have severe medical problems for the rest of their life and they're severely mentally impaired.. you would wish that you had amputated their arm, and you'd never forgive yourself as that child's parent.\n\nAll this to say, in literally ANY medical decision a parent is forced to make for their child, you have to weigh the pros and the cons. The risks and the benefits. If the risks outweigh the benefits, then you should probably not perform the surgery. If the benefits outweigh the risks, however, and you think the chances of your child dying if you \\*don't\\* perform the surgery are high enough, then any parent worth their weight in salt would choose to perform the surgery. Obviously, that child will be affected negatively for the rest of their life--they literally don't have an arm because of you. But the alternative may have been much worse. And my question is, what percent chance of death would the child need to have for you to agree with the parent's decision to amputate? Is a 10% chance high enough? Or what about a 50% chance of death? When is it considered \"child abuse and mutilation\" to amputate versus \"necessary to save the child's life/health\"?\n\nAnd why should YOU--someone who is not this child's parent, someone who has no idea what situation the child is in, no idea what the parents have already tried and how hard they've worked to try and stop the infection from spreading without resorting to amputation, you, who has no medical expertise whatsoever, who is not a doctor, who is not a health professional—why should you have the authority to say \"no, that's child mutilation, and should always be banned, in every single case, because that child isn't old enough to consent to having their arm chopped off.\"? Why should you have that kind of jurisdiction? Why should lawmakers have that kind of jurisdiction? Waving a wand and banning all amputations for children is so harmful and deadly, but these lawmakers are \"doing it for the children\"?? When they don't even know what these children's individual situations are?? When these lawmakers have no medical expertise whatsoever, and they're not the parents of these children?? They're not doing it \"for the sake of the children,\" they're doing it to give THEMSELVES peace of mind! If they allow these surgeries to take place, then they feel morally responsible for them. But if they ban the surgeries, then all the child death and suffering that occurs as a result of that are just a \"secondary effect\" of the ban, and \"not the intended result\", so these lawmakers don't have to feel morally responsible for the harm that their ban has caused to children (and parents and doctors). They can have plausible deniability now because, in their minds, they banned something that would cause harm. So even if more children are suffering, and even if more children die due to their ban on gender affirming care, that doesn't matter to them because \"well, that's not the intended result\". \n\nIn my opinion, your intent does not excuse your impact. You don't get to weaponize your ignorance and lack of medical expertise against a vulnerable population of people just to make yourSELF feel better. That's very callous and self-righteous.\n\nIf my child has been on puberty blockers, hormones, and therapy for years and years now, and their genitalia is the one thing that is causing them severe dysphoria to the point where I've had to resuscitate my own child 6 times now due to their 6 suicide attempts, how much longer should I wait as a parent? How many suicide attempts should it take before I finally say \"this is the only thing we haven't tried, and I'm desperate to save my child's life\"? Or should I just watch as my child continues to commit suicide over the years until one day they finally succeed? At least then I can say to myself, \"well, I did the right thing because at least I didn't mutilate their genitalia,\" right? My child is now dead, but AT LEAST I didn't mutilate their genitalia. They would thank me, if they were still alive today. And all the transphobic bigots of the world thank me for my decision too, so I should feel content, right?\n\nI think trans people's very existence in this world has been politicized by us cisgender people to where they've been dehumanized so much that cis people can't even see how such discussions (on whether or not parents should be able to make informed medical decisions with their doctors to save their children’s lives/health/wellbeing) continue to harm trans people and their families. I personally hate having to talk about this to bigots who are so ignorant on the topic yet somehow feel they have the right to make these medical decisions on behalf of trans people (even adults). \n\nAnd I hate having to paint such an extreme scenario with a child who has attempted suicide 6 times just to make them understand the severity of what they're advocating for when they advocate to ban something so universally and absolutely. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. I hope I didn't upset anyone with how I talked so bluntly about this issue. ",

Since then, I thought it was becoming more and more obvious that I'm transfemme. \n\nFor a time, I was off chronic pot use for around 2.5 months (lets say a bong hit once or twice a week). And during that time, my feelings of wanting to look and dress feminine completely dropped\n\nThere was a relapse period there from about february to this month, where I was smoking daily again, but still less than before. And again those feelings came back. Joy when I put on a dress, wore pushup bras under my clothes, put on makeup, wigs.\n\nNow here I am about a week sober again. I've been on estrogen and cypro for 2.5 weeks. The feeling is just barely there. Dressing up makes me feel... pretty indifferent now. It's like I don't care anymore. I still shave my body, but that's not really a feminine thing, when I think about it.\n\nJust like, was I really overthinking my gthis whole time on pot? Am I simply more focused on other aspects of my life now I deem more important? Is it just withdrawal? Is my brain not liking the estrogen? There's just so many factors here and hrt is starting to seem less and less worth it.  I mean, a whole other 12 or so years of puberty after I JUST finished this one? Giving up the quality of my orgasm? While the reversible effects of hrt do appeal to me, breast growth no longer does. It's just starting to seem less worth it.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all the friendly and honest replies. I seriously thought I was gonna be crucified for posting this.",

I met up with her over fries and brought up the points mentioned here(dysphoria, penis not working due to hrt, fetishization, etc) and she responded that if she had a Trans partner she'd be fine with whatever they were comfy with. She seemed a bit sad, but it was more directed to how it must feel to want to have sex but be dysphoric about something commonly used for the act. \n\n\nAlso she didn't know what a chaser was and her immediate reaction was \"Ew\" so I feel like she was \"a little confused, hut [she] got the spirit\"\n\n\nThanks again for helping us both grow, have a nice day",

She’s floated around the idea of her not being cis before and has told me how she feels and felt comfortable enough to come out to me. \n\nMy issue is is that I (19F), have never really been a feminine girl or partaken in a lot of things that society would consider feminine. I didn’t have a lot of girl friends growing up, so I feel like I missed out on a lot of the experience my girlfriend is looking for now. \n\nThe other issue is that she is still closeted to her friends and family. She’s been open to the idea of me doing her nails, and she wears my clothes when it’s just us or there’s nobody around. She doesn’t feel ready to come out yet so anything I do for her or with her would have to be things that wouldn’t out her or cause any questions to arise with things she wouldn’t or hasn’t done before (like painting her nails a noticeable colour).\n\nI’m so proud of her and happy she felt safe with coming out to me. I love her so much and I want her to feel so pretty and feminine and loved. I affirm her as much as possible and I tell her how beautiful she is and I want to do as much as I can with and for her, but I don’t really know where to start.\n\nWhat are some fun things we can do together or that I can do for her?",

Wear dresses, put on mummy's lipstick. He wanted to grow his hair long so he 'could look like a girl' (although he changed his mind on that and decided to shave his head instead).\n\nHe's never once said that 'he thinks he's a girl' or that 'he wants to be a girl' or has in anyway objected to being referred to as a boy. He refers to himself as a boy 'boys can wear dresses'.\n\nAside from the way he wants to dress and the fact he likes unicorns, his interest are mostly sterotypical 'boy things' and he's quite masculine. He loves wrestling and play fighting. He loves smashing things, throwing rocks. He likes dinosaurs and superherores (although not as much as unicorns).\n\nI know this is a very polarising topic, but I'm hoping for some insights or advice on best ways to address with the only bias of doing what's best for him.\n\nWe don't follow any structured religion so don't care what the Quran / Bible says on the matter.\n\nI don't care what other people think if they 'judge' us for letting our son dress up as a girl.\n\nBasically, I just want him to be as happy as possible now, feel loved and feel accepted. But I also want him to grow up to be as happy as possible.\n\nIf that is letting him wear what he wants then I'll do that. If that is pushing him in the direction of wearing 'boys things', then I'll do that.\n\nI just want him to be happy.\n\nI've been researching this and it's quite hard to find credible peer reviewed articles on the matter.\n\nFrom our limited research, we've basically decided to we let him do what he wants at home and compliment him on the way he looks and we don't make a big deal about it.\n\nI'm careful about letting him wear what he wants in public. Sometimes we do, but sometimes we don't think it's best for him to wear a dress in some situations.If he wants to wear a dress and we don't think it's approrpaite, we'll just say 'You look fantastic in your dress, but boys usually wear shorts and we're going somewhere where it's not appropriate for you to wear a dress' or something like that. Sometimes he's fine with it, sometimes he'll cry.\n\nI'm concerned he'll get teased if we let him just always wear dresses to school for instance.\n\nI'm also concerned that this may be a phase that he'll grow out of. And if we let him wear dresses in public now then the whole community of kids will remember and tease him forever (for something he grew out of and later regrets).\n\nSo bascically, I'm not really sure the best way to approach that with him.\n\nHe's never said he is a girl or wants to be a girl so we don't really talk about it much with him.\n\nSo, in summary would love some advice, in particular from people who have kids with similar traits or were kids themselves with similar traits?\n\nAgain, please offer advice based on his wellbeing.\n\nThat's all we care about.",

I hardly even read BL/GL things, only read that since I found out the guy in my PFP on another app was part of that manga and I read it out of curiosity... So I'm sort of confused why I'd want to be one of the guys in it so bad. It's not really because of jealousy like \"oh man I wish that was being done to me!!\" But also I feel comfortable seeing myself as a man in a gay relationship, hetero too but that's not really the point... I'm so confused, but I just wanted to know if that's a trans thing or what? Because I know I'm not fetishizing it, but why do I want to be a GUY in a homosexual relationship?

There are no exceptions from these rules...\n\nShe made me like I'm crazy but I'm her DAUGHTER, i explained her that I need her support with this, but guess what she was thinking \"What the world will think about us?\", \"If you father hear this\". \n\nI mentioned her, \"If your not accepting me, there s no problem, i had the plan B, i d move here in Germany forever and we ll talk less and less, my transition won't stop.\"\n\nShe know that I'm my entire life I was suffering from an abusive father and no rights in my life.\n\nShe was so rude, \"you want to put breasts?\", no I want to grow them by myself.\n\nShe: \"You have a house to build, you have to get a family, who will marry you?\", i answered with \"I have only one life, i can't live with this curse anymore, being a boy it s a curse for me since I know myself.\"\n\n  \nIn final we agreed to see a pshiholog but I'm sure that the answer of the pshiholog will be \"You must be a girl\".\n\nHow you think it was?

The constant self-doubt and second-guessing is driving me mad and making me feel like I’m gaslighting myself or reading off a script; like nothing I’ve been thinking, feeling, or saying to myself throughout this process is actually *mine*. I know that that *can’t* be true and it’s probably the autism, but it’s making it so difficult to figure out. I guess I'm hoping a third opinion will sway me.\n\nI’ve entertained the thought of being a woman / girl over the years, moreso in recent years owing to tweets or content from trans people that the algorithm has recommended me. Tweets about small things like “Did anyone else only ever play as women in games?” and “If you dreamed of being a girl but were afraid you’d be ugly that’s dysphoria” that resonated with me, but I’d write them off with the classic “uh oh ha-ha” and then quickly move on. Man, sure is weird that sounds like me, huh? I’d joke about it with some trans friends and that’d be that. A while back more and more trans women started appearing shitposting in my Twitter for you feed, and I began to enjoy seeing their tweets more and – whenever I saw a picture of any of them – realised I felt a little, I don’t know, envious? Then, just over a year ago I saw [**this fucking comic strip**](https://www.reallifecomics.com/comic.php?comic=june-29-2020). I’m sure a lot of you know it. This comic strip fucking broke me, like the dam that had stopped me from actually thinking about all those other tweets just couldn’t take it any more. I kept laughing like a lunatic for hours. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for *weeks*. It literally distracted me from doing things.\n\nIt’s funny, since I started thinking about it I’ve remembered so many things from my teenage years and childhood. I don’t really *have* many detailed memories from prior to late high school – my memory is generally pretty bad – and the ones I do have are generally vague, including some of these, but I digress. I worry some of these memories are fabricated or that I’m finding meaning where there is none, and I don’t honestly put much stock in early childhood habits, but still:\n\n* Until my teens, I always engaged with whatever toys, shows, or movies I could find: Barbies, Action Men, Littlest Pet Shop, Strawberry Shortcake, Hot Wheels, whatever. I probably played with more girls toys than most boys my age, it helped I wasn't really allowed anything violent.\n* Hated high school, friends, and myself – I took sick days off constantly early on, crying and, despite not being religious, praying that I’d wake up as anyone else (I vaguely remember praying to be a girl on occasion, but I don’t want to lean on a potentially fake memory).\n* Concocted elaborate ‘genie wish’ scenarios in which I’d design the perfect wish wording, often-time in an attempt to get gender-switching or shapeshifting abilities, although this was *partly* sexually charged at first. I’d get so into it, spend hours on it, that I’d get genuinely disappointed on remembering it was all fiction.\n* Similarly, discovered the gender button question via a ‘Would You Rather’ app and for a time thought about it a lot – I couldn’t understand why anyone would say no if presented with the opportunity to change their gender (least of all for a payout lmao) and still don't entirely.\n* Developed an obsession with feminisation and transformation media, particularly non-con, which I still enjoy engaging with in a less sexual manner than before; this began with the discovery and subsequent binge-reading of the ‘Gender Bender’ manga genre.\n* Around this time I would occasionally (increasingly rarely over time) try on my sister’s clothes when home alone. This was originally for sexual reasons, but I became quickly annoyed at my body’s reactions to it and that I looked like a guy in bad drag.\n* Desperately wanted to be a femboy or crossdresser for a short time – or at least have the physical appearance – but didn’t have the energy to work towards it and chose to fantasize instead.\n\nMany of these memories are clearly sexual in nature, if not wholly then partly, which causes me to occasionally worry that this entire gender crisis may just be me misunderstanding a sexual fascination. Consciously I know this is bullshit, and I think less about it now than I did before, but it doesn’t stop the idea from surfacing. In addition to these there’s a number of smaller things that have been prevalent since puberty and haven’t changed significantly since:\n\n* I always preferred longer hair, but told people it was so I didn’t have to look people in the eyes – I don’t *hate* short hair, I just prefer my hair longer (even if I have grown to dislike how my current haircut looks). The idea of balding is horrifying to me and I've begun obssessing over my hairline.\n* For the longest time I’ve always played as female characters in games – but not in things like D&D, where the idea felt… unobtainable, like I wasn’t allowed to do it – to the point of genuinely being less invested and less likely to complete a game now if I’m playing a guy (I always told people it was so I’d be looking at a woman, classic right?).\n* Have hated my body hair since puberty; I hate being shirtless or trouser-less, especially around people, and male (well, all) changing rooms and bathrooms have always made me a little uncomfortable partly because of it – I don’t even like wearing shorts.\n* Have occasionally considered the idea of having a vagina and found it ‘neat’, but have always been generally *fine*, if not apathetic, about my penis.\n   * I hadn't really thought about having breasts til recently, but the feeling is more-or-less the same. Though I recently remembered that I used to often squeeze my chest together with my arms and once spent a year occasionally thumping my chest after reading a war story about soldiers that accidentally developed breasts doing that.\n* I've never really been able to see a future for myself, which I'm told is a sign. As a kid I had things I wanted to be, now I just exist for existing's sake because I'm terrified of death, and want to just sit and do nothing; there's hobbies I want to try but won't stick to and enough games to play and books to start to keep me going, which I enjoy enough.\n\nDespite all this, I never questioned my gender too closely, because the way I always saw it is that I am me and that’s… it. I was raised as a boy so, even if I never really fit in with other boys and alwasy felt closer to female family members, I was a boy. I mean, that's just an autism thing, right? When people spoke about how they “feel like X” I never understood it, and always assumed that was the norm – this led to some regular transphobia as a teenager -- and even now I hear about how this is sorta how cis people feel. Now I wonder if I’ve been looking in the wrong place mentally or if this *is* just how cis people feel about their gender, even if it feels like it *should* be different? But why does that possibility bum me out? It *can’t* be the case, right? I mean, you read that shit.\n\nI’ve tried some things to experiment, but probably not as much as I should have -- it's hard. Nothing I *have* tried has helped, though.\n\n* As I mentioned, I’ve tried wearing my older sister’s clothes when she’s away and while they seem to make me feel vaguely positive – I *do* like the skirt spin – that often turns into feeling like a hairy dude in a dress, especially when I glimpse my reflection.\n* I’ve looked through the effects of HRT and I’m *pretty sure* I like most of the effects – hell, even the negative ones like sterility are fine – and looking at the T effects varies between dislike and “eh”.\n* I spent over 10 hours (I recorded it) self-debating my identity, reading through the Dysphoria Bible and ‘answering’ every paragraph at length, but if I try to listen back to it it all feels too unbelievable, like I’m hearing myself read a script. Occasionally early on I’d come to the conclusion that I was cis and feel *disappointed in that answer*.\n* Since thinking about this, I’ve begun to take more of an interest in women’s fashion and make-up, and become hyper-aware of my more masculine features – many of which I’ve never liked – to the point of trying to spot similar features on women I see around to alleviate it. I scrutinise myself every time I look in the mirror now. This wasn’t this much of an issue before, and I didn't care about clothes before, is this just because I feel like I should?\n* I think about hypotheticals and listen to audio roleplays aimed at women and all of it feels *fine* in a positive sense, but none of it makes me feel anything *strong*. I wonder if it’s because I know it’s fake.\n\nI’m too afraid to actually take meaningful steps like properly shaving my face and body or try on make-up, and even when I vow to actually take steps I can’t bring myself to do it or get overwhelmed -- what if I accidentally hurt myself? I’m worried I might be mirroring and copying friends and the other trans people that appear in my feed online in a bid to want to be more like them; I’m worried my autistic brain might just be trying to fit in with a community I like engaging with; I’m worried that I’m conflating any feelings of envy or jealousy with attraction or lust, and it makes me feel like a creep. I have trouble understanding my complex emotions, and I worry I’m reading into them to see what I want to see. I’ve second guessed most of this post as I’ve written in. I know everything I do at this point is so easily reversible should need be, but it still feels like a wall I can’t pass.\n\nMy biggest issue is that everything feels drowned in a feeling of apathy. I know I’m not apathetic, I feel strong emotions all the time – mainly anger and frustration, but also joy and excitement when talking with friends or playing games – but when it comes to stuff like this it feels like all I experience is different degrees of apathy. I feel apathy over being a guy, I feel potentially slightly less apathy at the idea of being a woman but I'm unable to prove it. Strongest feelings have been a bubbling, awkward sort of giddiness over buying a pair of women’s trainers and being given pride glasses as a joke. I wonder if it's just because I'm not supposed to have them.\n\nOther people’s stories don’t reflect my experiences in any meaningful way, and I get upset that I can never relate. I keep reading them because I feel like I *need* to find someone who’s almost identical to me, someone who’s already asked the questions and found the answers, even though I know it’s impossible. Every story I read feels like the person “always knew” or “showed a lot of signs as a kid” or experienced serious mental health issues stemming from dysphoria or trauma. I’m very lucky, I have some very supportive family members and I’ve never had anything resembling a psychological episode, even my autism is considerably high-functioning; at worst I’ve had undiagnosed generalised anxiety and quite possibly mild depression for a while – including a vague self-hatred and general sense of angry apathy – all of which is fine and I'm used to. Suffice it to say I feel like a real fucking asshole sitting there and thinking “These people’s issues helped them figure it out, I'll never manage it”.\n\nI feel like I’m running against the clock – If I was trans, and if I did transition, I know I’d want the bodily changes but I’m just under a year off 25. I have no idea what’s a manifestation of my autism or undiagnosed health issues or unrealised trauma and what’s *real* – sometimes I wonder if all this is maybe because I was lightly molested as a kid, which I feel I should note, but it didn’t affect me prior. No idea what’s normal body dysmorphia that I’ve retroactively reasoned as dysphoric and what might be actual dysphoria. I’m *terrified* of being trans – terrified of being *wrong*, even though I know how little is permanent – of the societal response, of the work I’d need to put in, of not passing, but I’m equally as terrified as not taking the leap and finding out and disappointed in the idea of staying as I am, of not being able to be pretty or cool or cute.\n\nI came out to my mother 2 months or so back as \"maybe non-binary\" and she was pretty responsive to it (\"I always thought there was something\" lol). I'd got so worked up and scared about it, despite knowing she'd be on board, that I ended up having to do it in the midst of a panic attack as a spur of the moment decision. Thing is, I'm not sure I *am* non-binary. I said that because of my generaly apathy around gender, and because I know a lot of autistic trans people often are... but the more time passes the more I'm not sure if I actively like non-binary pronouns having tried them out online and in games. Might be because the apparent desire is to be feminine, and they/them isn't particularly affirming of that? Who knows.\n\nI’ve tried therapy, but I quickly gave up. The prospect is too overwhelming and I don’t know where to start. I couldn’t bring myself to talk about my gender and now I find myself in a situation where every specialist therapist is a zoom call and there’s far too many to easily pick between. I don’t even know where I’d start in the actual transitioning process, there’s so much to do and learn. I’ve had a sort of surge of confidence this month though and I’ve started slowly putting together a transition plan in case I *am* trans, collecting resources, guides, and things to try in a document when I have the motivation to.\n\nThere’s so much more I want to include in this post, but it’s so long already and It’d feel a little masturbatory I guess. Sorry for the length if you read this, I don’t even know why I’m wrote it really. I guess it’s something I’ve been meaning to do for months, but I hate talking about myself and am terrible at structure so it took until now to manage it. I don’t know if I’m genuinely asking for advice or if I’m just here to vent. Thanks.",

My parents are still living together but they are now sleeping in different rooms and I think they are going to split. But I’m finding it hard to talk to my trans mom now she has transitioned. Before I didn’t really interact with her much as when she came home from work she would mostly just watch tv and drink and didn’t really try and talk to me much. Which I guess is not great but now she is trying to interact and fix it it’s worse tbh. It’s like now she is trying to be really ott feminine like to overcompensate for it and I find that annoying and she keeps wanting to spend “girl time” with me and go shopping and things like that and I’m not really into that. I don’t really know what I want to do but it just feels weird to me and she everything she does seems really over the top or exaggerated. But I don’t really know how to talk to her about this as it’s hard to do without upsetting her as everything seems to upset her when I try and talk to her or trigger her dysphoria. And also I told her she had way too much makeup on and she looked a bit ridiculous and then she asked me to teach her which I found weird and the idea of doing that creeped me out and then she got annoyed with me as she just wants to connect and then I was like I don’t want to do those things and the she got upset that this must be because I don’t see her as a real woman yet and I found it difficult to talk to her. Tbh I just want to avoid her and not really talk to her much like before but now she is intent on trying to fix it with us and I guess that would be good if possible. I think my cis mom is also struggling but when I talk to her she is like we have to remember that it’s much tougher for her and to be sympathetic but it’s hard to do that and I’m finding it all frustrating and annoying tbh. What’s the best way to try and deal with this situation and try and fix it for us?\n\n",

I know deep down that I need to get the surgeries before becoming a conference interpreter for a multitude of reasons. For example, I'll more likely to be hired as a conference interpreter (I am Hungarian and I am going to have to work with Hungarian too and as all of you might know, Hungarian aren't super accepting of trans sexuality and neither are the Chinese [Chinese is going to me my  working languages in addition to English and Hungarian ). Also, I will be able to find a boyfriend more easily, people will take me more seriously,etc.\n\nBut I really envy cis people. They don't need to worry about this sh*t. They can just straight go and become whatever their heart desires and then work in their dream job whereas I am going to have to do a job I am not going to enjoy for three years just to get FFS and BFS 😣. \n\nI know I shouldn't be whining because my parents are really helpful and I recognize the fact that I am lucky in this regard but I was really hoping that I could realize both my dream of becoming a full-fledged woman and my dream of becoming a conference interpreter for Hungarian, English and Mandarin at the same time. 😔 I am so scared that when I enroll in the training program, it might be too late 😔 but I need the surgeries in order to be happy. 😔",

My dad told me that \"this family doesn't support any gay/queer shit\" and that I'm a fucking faggot. They kept calling me a fucking weirdo and that they're going to disown me. What my parents forgot was that they took out $50,000 in parent plus loans for me to go to college at a private college. Therefore, this debt is in their name. I told them that I would pay it back after college; however, I've done my research, and verbal agreement is not enough to put me in responsibility for the loans. Therefore, I'm thinking that since I'm going to need money to pay for transition, and I'm gonna be in debt, why not just leave them with that debt since they wanted to treat me the way that they did.\n\nI used to hear people on youtube and in person talk about how their brains were telling them to hurt themselves, and I never understood what they were saying. It wasn't until they treated me this way that I felt what they meant. This was the first time in my life when my brain literally was telling me to k\\*ll myself. I had to fight through horrible emotions that I've never experienced before. I'm already alienated in my life, and I have no friends. I don't talk to anyone at my college because I'm in the closet there, and I basically live with my own thoughts in my head. I'm ready to transition and become myself and leave my disgusting parents.\n\nMy question for you is if you think that I should pay the money back because I said I would or if I should leave them with the debt and forget them and start my own life in Boston or New York? I'm from texas btw.\n\nThank you\n\nEdit: I have a little brother in 8th grade who didn't say anything bad to me, but he will experience the repurcussions of their actions. I feel bad for him, but I've definitely decided that if I don't pay the 50k back that I will be sending him money so that he can buy clothes, laptop, etc to get him through high school. basically, if he wants/needs any money, I'll give him money.",

When I was younger I felt like it would’ve been easier to be born a male because I didn’t feel girl enough and that would be a reasonable excuse for my feelings, but not that I WANTED to be a man. Like I felt like a man in a woman’s body who desperately wants to BE a woman, if that makes sense (which no it doesn’t, that’s why I’m here lol). \n\nTo be clear, I feel like people perceive me as male/masculine even though that’s simply not true. I look, dress, and “act” like a woman, I don’t get misgendered literally ever. I wear makeup and dresses and feel beautiful in them. I like all my parts and pieces, I don’t wish to have male parts or be seen as a male and it distresses me deeply to even consider NOT being a girl. So why tf do I not feel girl enough?? \n\nIf anything I want to be MORE girl, to feel connected to my womanly body, and as far away as possible from masculine anything. It’s not like I’m a trans woman who is mentally a woman but born a man, I was born a woman and am deeply attached to being a woman but I simply don’t mentally feel womanly. It’s so confusing, I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense! \n\nTrans women can transition to have their body match their brains, but my body IS what I want it to be so why does it feel like something is off still?

To sum up that convo he said he’ll still love me no matter what but he doesn’t support my decision nor does he want me coming over looking and or dressing like a woman.\n\nI had to go over recently and I can’t remember exactly how I worded it, but shortly before I was leaving I had said something and referred to myself as a gal at the end of my sentence. He responds with “gal?”, so I said “well yeah if no one’s gonna pronoun me correctly around here I’ll do it myself”. I had said that last thing in kind of a joking manner, and his response was “oh yeah you’ll never catch me doing that shit”. I was so fed up with him in the moment i just turned my back and left. \n\nI’m just not entirely sure what to do about it. Part of me just wants to be done entirely with him and just cut his disrespectful ass off, but the other part of me wants to still give him a chance and maybe give him an ultimatum or something. He’s always been a selfish and controlling piece of shit throughout my life.

    "selftext": "I'm trans (mtf) and I've noticed that my friend has a lot of very eggy thoughts that they voice to me. He's talked to me before about not feeling \"manly\" enough, and not being percieved as masculine in the way that most men are. He feels like he'll never be a \"real man\" like other men in his family are.\n\nUsually I just kinda listen and make him feel heard. But last night we were out pretty late and chatted about it in more depth. He mentioned dressing up as a woman sometimes when he's alone and wanting to be able to present that way more comfortably. And he talked excitedly about things he'd do if he were a woman.\n\nWhile we were talking, we both had out legs crossed in what most consider a more feminine way. He noticed it and ask me if that's how women cross their legs. I was kinda like \"Well, I don't think leg crossing determines gender. But I guess that this is stereotypically considered more feminine.\" He sorta sarcastically switched to a very wide spread leg stance in order to sit like a \"man.\" But almost immediately he subconsiously went back to crossed legs. And when he noticed it again I just kinda told him he should sit however he feels comfortable, instead of worrying about forcing manly posture. So we just chatted cross legged together after that.\n\nI'd honestly always gotten a bit of an eggy vibe before this, just by his mannerisms and way he's discussed gender. But I'd never tried to suggest the idea, since I feel like that shouldn't come from me. But after talking about it last night, I noticed I was jokingly kinda sales pitching being trans a bit. Like, at one point a woman flashed her boobs. My buddy got super excited and was all \"man, seeing some boobs just made my day so much better.\" So I went all wink wink, nudge nudge, like \"y'know, I can think of a way of being able to see boobs every single day, and all you need is a mirror.\" I just kinda dropped a few lines like that about perks I've noticed since transitioning.\n\nAm I doing anything wrong? I don't want to come across as giving too much peer pressure on this issue. But it's not like I'm the one that made him question these things in the first place. I just want my friend to be happy and comfortable.",

    "selftext": "A study was released some time ago that measured the athletic performance of trans woman and men in the military. At the end of the study, the trans women ran 12% faster then the cis women they were compared to. This one piece of data mentioned on the abstract led to the study being cited heavily by conservatives passing laws barring trans women from sport. In reality, however, most of the data fits in line with other studies supporting the participation of trans women.\n\nBetween the 1st and 2nd year of hormone therapy, the running performance of trans women had decreased by 11%. That 11% decrease reflects the results of previous studies, as well as the athletic gap between elite men and women in many sports. In addition, muscle endurance of trans women at the end of the study were equivalent to the cis women they were compared to.\n\nThe study also lacked a proper control group. The performance of the cis women and cis men were not measured over time. This means that the study couldn't properly account for possible training related improvements. There likely were training related improvements, because after the second year, the aforementioned 11% decrease shrunk to 8%. There's also the implication that if a proper control group had been used, then trans women would have shown WORSE muscle endurance than cis women by the end of the study.\n\nlink: [https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/11/577](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/11/577)",

As an immigrant, person of color, and transgender individual, I’m navigating multiple layers of risk and don’t want to add more by being visibly out.\n\nCurrently, I wear makeup, keep my hair long, and choose clothing that feels comfortable for me while still fitting within male presentation.

If HRT causes noticeable changes that could draw attention, I’m prepared to adjust—for example, cutting my hair, minimizing makeup, or sticking to more traditional male clothing. \n\nI want to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations or who have insights about managing HRT while staying in \"boy mode.\" Are my expectations realistic, or am I being naive about the changes and challenges HRT might bring?

After a research rabbit hole I know better now than to call trans women male, but next comes another problem. How would I define \"reproductively compatible,\" for lack of a better term? Because from my understanding, even though trans men are the opposite sex it's not likely that we could reproduce \"normally.\" I want to be clear in what I want because I dont want to string anyone along/waste their time, but I also dont want to go about it incorrectly.\n\nMe stuff aside, it's made me wonder if other trans folk—especially those who are mostly t4t—want biological children with their partner, and how most of us view reproduction in general. How do we navigate \"reproductive compatibility\"? Obviously this question isnt meant for the childfree crowd. \n\nEdit: Oh wow I didnt think Id get this many responses!

And now that it seems like maybe social acceptance is moving in the other direction, living your authentic life sounds like there will be consequences you never thought you would have to face so you want to hide or detransition to protect yourself. \nAnd if you really feel that way you can. But queer and trans people have always been safer when we stick together and stay out of the closet as much as possible. \nThere's a quote about fascism that goes \"don't obey in advance\" \nBasically, nobody has time to come after you. At least not right now. And if a bunch of people decide to not be trans together, it makes it harder for the people who can't ever go back. \n\nIt wasn't that long ago that North Carolina passed their bathroom bills and every trans person in Raleigh went to go piss in their preferred bathroom in the state capitol building just for fun. Did they get arrested? Fuck no. They laughed about it and took selfies and went home with a fun story. \n\nThe only reason that being trans is even somewhat socially acceptable is people who did it even though it had incredible costs. For years and years and years. And also people who did it even though people thought we were just weirdos! For even more years! \n\nWe all have to make choices to survive. For example tons of people hide who they are as kids while having to live with unsupportive family. Other people work hard to be stealth and disappear into society (a bit harder now than it used to be tbh) \nBut right now nobody is making you make that choice. So just chill out for a second. Maybe get inspired by the long history of trans people organizing under all sorts of conditions and join a local mutual aid organization. Half of the anarchists and antifascists I've ever met are trans and a bunch of them do DIY HRT and live however they want to live, often breaking whatever laws they want to with very few consequences. Join a gay gun club or something. And this is coming from someone in the rural southern US. I've met so many badass trans people who changed the world around them in all sorts of environments. Not everybody is born to be a badass, but you don't need to freak out to this level right now. \n\nSocial acceptance comes and goes and some people value that more than being themselves, but today, this morning, nobody is doing anything to you. \nPeople hate us because they know we're going to win.

It just feels like, as an adult to transition it's like tearing down a whole apartment complex to completely remodel it while there's still people in it (people who know you as a cis man, friends, family, coworkers, etc) while as a kid you're just changing the blueprints to the house and fixing the foundation. \n\nI know that this is a silly regret, because really I'm privileged to have my own money, my own social skills and ability to make choices as a person whereas a kid would be beholden to their parents... \n\nBut I mean, even as an adult, I'm emotionally beholden to my parents in a way. I desperately don't want to make them angry or disappointed in me. I have friends who will only ever see me as a man, and I'm completely masculinized to the point that I'll never truly pass unless I get ffs or wear layers of makeup which I never learned to do...

Obviously it's not all black and white though, so maybe you have your own way ?\n\nPersonally, I'm not outing myself to just anyone, but I dress and act pretty femme, so people probably know something is up.

    "selftext": "I'm a trans woman and started my transition about 8 years ago. I had bottom surgery this year and I regret it big time, not because something went wrong but because I got bottom dysphoria now. I know it sounds very odd and I was really hesitant about posting here...\n\nI need to go back in time a bit to explain this. I never had bottom dysphoria and never wanted to get bottom surgery done, I actually like how pre/non op trans women look like, in an aesthetic way and I had no issues showing my whole body off on the internet, I even always wanted to get into adult content creation but never managed to do so because of my heavy depressions. I did however have issues with people irl noticing a bulge or something as I'm a very shy and insecure person and I wanted to be able to go swimming etc. and always wished I was strong enough to just not give a damn about what strangers might think. I even had orchiectomy because I was very sure I don't want full bottom surgery and I liked my setup, even had it pierced.\n\nIn the past couple of years my depressions reached an unbearable level and my libido became nonexistent, probably due to mental health and medication, making me lose all interest in anything about the nether regions and only the social issues stayed present. On top of that my surroundings, mostly trans women, and even my previous therapist kept telling me that surgery is known to help with mental health issues and somehow even I started to believe it in. I ended up having surgery, probably only because it was fully paid by insurance, which retrospectively is a bad sign.\n\nNow I've been working on my mental health big time this year and when my libido came back it hit me like a brick that I'm now feeling dysphoric about how I look down there and wish I could undo all that. I also noticed that despite my efforts to look as normal and cis as possible the past years, I actually want to look alternative and queer and I only tried to be like that due to insecurity, social pressure and depressions and that I absolutely need to start being myself and stop trying to be someone else just to be able to be invisible among strangers in public.\n\nI'm not sure what I expect from this post as no one is able to fix me now but I guess I just wanted to write everything down. It's just killing me that I went from no bottom dysphoria to heavy bottom dysphoria that's making me even more suicidal than I already am by a stupid decision that usually is quite helpful to trans people. I'm literally crying myself to sleep every night recently because I can't do anything about my situation.",

That I didnt know how far it would go, but that it was a process and nothing would change overnight. She took it well. We had agreed to tell our girls together(10,13,15) and seek a therapist for them. I asked her to sit with this, and to ask me anything she wanted to. That lasted about 3 days, the morning of the third day, she came at me via txt, hard! So worried and upset about the girls, and hinting at how they would never see me again If they chose not to. \n\nThis was already a stressful situation. At the time she was texting novels, about how this would destroy our children. I was sitting with a dear friend, passing away from this life to the next. I begged her to let it go. We could talk about it later, but the hate kept coming. I was very upset and asked her to forget I ever told her. That the girls never need to know..... that only got me more hateful messages, saying she couldn't just forget it, she had already told our oldest about me being transgender. She Proceeded to tell me that she did this in a Non-bias way, and that my daughter was Disgusted and wanted nothing to do with me.\n\nThat ended up being completely untrue, we have a court order in place, and when the time came, my oldest seemed if anything, closer to me the entire time. Communication with my Ex has been poor since then. I've tried, with the patience of a saint, to be as peaceful as possible with this......the other girls don't know and I feel like that's a huge weight to ask my oldest to carry alone. I kept pushing the fact that the girls should go to a therapist, especially the oldest, that I would find my own for them if need be! The girls now have an appointment, this Monday, that my ex scheduled, she informed me, that she was asked to come, but they said the girls should be seen without me........ does this seem right? Has anyone done this or been in this position before, I truly want what's best for them. Yet I've never been in this position before.....",

Having our identity validated is a *real* issue.\n\nUsing the phrase 'perceived gender identity' struck a chord with me because it feels like opening the door to talking more explicitly about this issue.

I'm a cisgender man, but I've never been comfortable with my penis. I don't identify as a woman nor do I have any intention of transitioning, but I have seriously considered the idea of having a vaginoplasty to have a vagina instead of a penis.\n\nI know this may sound confusing to some, but it makes sense to me. I don't feel good about my current genitalia and I think I'd be more comfortable with a body that has a vagina. I have no intention of changing my gender identity or the way I live my daily life; I simply want to feel more aligned with my own body.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or known someone who has gone through something like this. Is it normal to feel this way as a cisgender man? Is there anyone who has opted for a vaginoplasty in a similar situation? I appreciate any thoughts or experiences you can share.\n\nThank you for reading and any comments you may have!",
