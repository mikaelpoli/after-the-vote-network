He was exactly my type and just seemed really cool and interesting. We went on a date, I didn’t let him touch or kiss me or anything since he didn’t know I was trans, and then the next day he said he wanted to see me again. I could tell he really liked me, but we would hang out at his place and snuggle so I knew I had to tell him I was trans prior to this. I did. He’s not interested and that sucks. This is pretty much what dating has been for me for awhile now. Extreme interest in me until they learn one detail about me. One little thing. And I get it, some people want to have biological kids. Some don’t want the parts I’m working with. But damn, it makes you feel like your womanhood is only as valuable as your parts and ability to make babies. Like I’m not valuable enough as is? It makes me sad. And the first few times this happened to me, I brushed it off but I’m getting really tired of it. If it’s not a guy losing interest irl, they’ll just straight up unmatch on dating apps. I’ve probably had 95% of guys unmatch me. It’s invalidating to my womanhood and it’s hurtful. \n\nAnd then on top of that, all the other nonsense we have to deal with. DL guys wanting to keep our conversations a secret, chasers trying to get in our pants, men who just want to experiment with you. I’m just tired of this. Maybe love ain’t for me!\n\nNot to mention, the very existence of trans people is hotly debated right now. I can’t even sit down at a bar, or hell, work where I work (in a bar) without hearing someone give a transphobic opinion or hear it on campaign ads. I live in a red state. Being trans really sucks imo. ",

    "selftext": "Okay, so this was a while back when I first started public school again, and at the time, I passed pretty well, if I still looked a bit fem due to my round face. Well, I explained to the school that I was trans and asked about being able to possibly use gender neutral bathrooms/locker rooms, or if I could just use the men's. And considering this is a school in Texas, they told me no and that I couldn't even use the gender neutral ones because those were really meant for disabled kids/teachers. I shrugged and said \"alright if that's what you want me to do\" and started school.\n\nAnyway, gym class rolls around and I am stoked, I love exercising and running around like a feral rat child so gym has basically always been recess for me. The teacher sends us off to the locker room to get our lockers for the year and change our clothes. I had to stay behind for a second so I could ask how the locker combos worked (different from my old school) but after that I ran off to the locker rooms to change. It's very important that we note that I was one of the last people to enter.\n\nI walk in, and immediately, at least 3 girls yell, \"WRONG ROOM\" and \"GET OUT\" while covering themselves. I jumped and looked around cuz I assumed a guy had followed me in here, but nope, I was the only person near the door. I turn back around and a bunch of the girls are scrambling to cover themselves, others are glaring, and one of them is even starting to walk towards me to push me out.\n\nNow I'm confused, so I ask. \"Isn't this the girls locker room?\"\n\nThe girl walking towards me to push me out, scoffs. \"Yeah, GET OUT.\" and then she starts literally shoving me towards the door.\n\nIt then dawns on me what has happened, and I'm not sure whether to be happy, embarrassed, apologetic or what. But I quickly stammer out that I'm trans but afab so the school told me to use these locker rooms. This gives the girls some pause and the girl shoving me stops. But everyone still looks very skeptical and uneasy\n\nSo I do the first thing I can think of, I take off my shirt to show that I'm wearing a binder while very panickly saying \"see, I'm not a creepy dude I swear.\" \n\nAnyway, they all look uncomfortable, end up asking a few more questions before letting me use the locker rooms in peace. I think that's the end of it and I now have a funny story to tell my friends after school. \n\nIt was, in fact, not the end. \n\nTurns out a small group of those girls, in their words, \"really uncomfortable with a man in the locker rooms, even if he doesn't have a dick and balls.\" (I'm giggling at kicking my feet at this sentiment) so they all band together and complain to administration about how they are making the locker rooms uncomfortable for everyone by putting me in there.\n\nAdministration does not back down, basically saying in fancy terms that I was born a girl so I am girl and I was going to use the girls locker rooms. The group of girls are furious on my behalf, but it gets so much worse when they learn I was using the girl's bathrooms too.\n\nTurns out, there are some girls that don't take gym but do use the bathrooms often, that are also annoyed with my presence. They join up with the girls and continue hounding administration to just let me use the other bathrooms because literally everyone is uncomfortable with my presence. Keep in mind, I have no clue that they are doing this.\n\nAnyway, one girl apparently complains to her mom about this and her mom is furious that the school is sacrificing not only my comfort, but all the girls comfort just to uphold their bigotry. She storms into the school and yells at the principal, threatening to sue.\n\nWell, that's all it took for the principal to get on the intercoms, call me down to the office, slam the gender neutral locker room/ bathroom key in my hand, and say that I was allowed to use whatever bathroom I was comfortable using.\n\nMoral of the story, even if your transphobic, if someone passes well enough, don't try to shove them in with the wrong gender, it just makes everyone uncomfortable",

    "selftext": "I (20f) started identifying as nonbinary/transmasc at 14. I wasn’t sure what “girl” felt like, but knew I couldn’t connect to that experience. I struggled with my body image, specifically my chest— I had breasts that were very large in proportion to the rest of me, and hated it. I figured this was gender dysphoria. Last year I had a breast reduction, and the shitty feeling went away. It turns out I don’t mind having chest tissue, I just didn’t like having a ton of it. \n\nA few months ago I was diagnosed with autism. I’d always felt like I was “defective” or like an alien or something. The diagnosis let me put into words why I felt so wrong. I realized that I actually feel fine about identifying as female, I just couldn’t connect to other girls. I didn’t feel human growing up. How could I have felt like a girl when I didn’t even feel like a person? Ofc there are so many people who are both trans and autistic, but that’s not me. I’m not trans. I questioned and questioned, and it turns out I genuinely was cis. Identifying as female again doesn’t make me sad, but losing this community certainly does. \n\nI wanted to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart. The trans community is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever been a part of, even if I wasn’t really a part of it after all. I’m glad I questioned my gender. I think I’m better for having done it. And I’ll NEVER be one of those “detrans” fuckers who thinks they “escaped” something bad. I’ll never stop fighting against transphobia. I’ll fight for trans rights however I can for the rest of my fucking life. Thank you for allowing me to have this space while I questioned, and thank you for being amazing. I’m so so glad to have known this community the way I did. Thank you. :) ",

What I like, what I don't like, what I'm capable of, and even what I'm not capable of.\n\nAnd most importantly, what I want/don't want.\n\nI feel like I'm finally stepping into the true role of elder trans lately and offering more advice/guiding people to resources, especially with insurance. I feel like a mother to a lot of newer trans girlies I meet, and it's a good feeling. \n\nI also just want to take a moment and assure people who are older, you absolutely can transition and reach goals. It can be a lot of hard work, and a little luck, but it's possible. I didn't start my transition until I was 29 years old. I was overweight, unhealthy, and sad. Transition helped me care about myself and now I'm in the healthiest shape of my life and many of my health problems are gone/under control (including my asthma). You can do it. \n\nFor those who are curious. I've had two rounds of FFS (planning on a third), a breast augmentation (405cc round implants over muscle), and VFS (vocal feminization surgery). Happy to answer any questions. :) ",

If you look up cat ear hat or beanie, you will find my go to Hat! \n\nUrban outfitters: an amazing story for day to day pieces, however just make sure that you’re looking carefully at the quality of the fabrics, as a lot of things here are quite cheap quality for a quite expensive price\n\nSoul Flower: this is an online store, where I get most of my hippie style clothing like dresses and oversized flowey skirts and pants!! \n\nHot topic: an amazing place for jewelry, chunky belts and cute skirt\n\nThrift stores: lastly, and most importantly I would say check out thrift stores!! this is where I get the majority of my wardrobe probably 60 to 70% of my clothes are secondhand or thrifted, my recommendation when going to thrift stores is make sure that you really look at every single piece because there’s a lot of junk and a few treasures, and go early in the morning because usually thrift stores restock at night, and so all of the good stuff is there first thing in the morning!!\n\nIf you have any recommendations to add this list please comment below!!

    "selftext": "My Grandma has made a tradition out of personally making Christmas stockings for all of her children, grandchildren, and in-laws, each one with that person’s name and birthday on them. My stocking was made just a few months after I was born, and since then she has fixed it twice.\n\nThe first time was when I was almost too young to even remember it. We spent the holiday at my uncle’s house and his dog tore through my stocking trying to get the candy inside it. My grandma was able to fix it but it still has a bit of a scar and that actually ended up making my stocking much longer than any of my siblings. \n\nThe second time she fixed it was just this week. See, about 2.5 years ago I came out as transgender, and ever since then Christmas has been rough for me. Not just because it was always such a Christian centered holiday in my house, but also because my family and my stocking were no longer using the correct name. In the last year, I have been much more open about my identity with my family despite the fact that they are pretty much all conservative and Christian. Surprisingly, a lot of them have been pretty good about using the correct name. A couple of weeks ago, I asked my grandma if she would be able to change the name on my stocking, and to my surprise, she told me that she had already started doing exactly that! I’m so grateful that my family is doing their best to acknowledge and accept my identity. I know it hasn’t been easy for them, but it’s great to see that they’re making progress. ",

So I wanted to take a moment to clear up any misinformation. \n\nSome shrinking *can* happen on HRT as a result of fat/ligaments/other soft tissues changing/moving around in the body, however this is at most only a couple of inches. \n\nThe body's height also naturally fluctuates someonwhat with age, posture, and spinal health which also can contribute to some transfems reporting height loss. \n\nBut the bottom line is that, sadly, estrogen will not cause your bones to get smaller. You will not get significantly shorter because of HRT. I personally went down a shoe size and lost about an inch of height, but that was from weight loss and my age more than anything. \n\nAnyways, that's all. Just trying to helpful so that people in the community don't get false hopes or end up feeling like other people are getting better results from HRT and you're just unlucky. \n\nAlso adding a selfie here because I just got my hair redone and to add traction to post and spread the PSA more 🤷‍♀️\nYou all seem to like my selfies lol.",

A yelling match occurred for about 2ish hours they said stuff like “we didn’t raise you to be this way” “we’ll take you down to the gay bar and see if you’re really gay” my dad even threatened to kill me. That’s when my 2 older brothers came over and asked what was going on because my mom texted them. My parents made me come out to them on the spot, my brothers sided with me and argued with my parents saying that it’s ok the was that I was but it had no effect they only got more and more angry. Finally mom just said “you can’t be gay in my house” and told me to\nPack my things, my brothers helped me load up my stuff and now I’m staying at one of their houses I don’t really what to do or go from here I have a job so at least I can provide for myself. I think I’m gonna work toward getting my drivers license and see if I can find a cheap place to stay. Merry Christmas I guess. UPDATE: im back at my parents house for now they don’t accept me but wanna buy me in therapy im gonna play along for now get my drivers license and save up to rent a room thank you for all of your support it’s overwhelming I love you all <3",

I’ve spoken with our school’s equity program raising concerns that I have along with my friends and fellow community members.

My dad did misgender me once or twice but you could definitely tell he is getting better and trying really hard. I got called ma’am at the bar and everything. Overall they took it very well. I am still getting used to being their daughter and they’re still getting used to me being their daughter. My mom is taking me clothes shopping tomorrow so we’ll see how that goes.

The tldr of it was trans women could face prison in the upcoming years, but trans men would “only” face forced detransition, since we’re seen as victims and not predators.\n\nI’m sick and tired of people thinking we’ve (trans men) got it easy somehow. My parents literally kicked me out because they thought I was a danger to my younger sibling when I started to transition.\n\nThe laws aren’t going to separate us based on what our AGAB is. They’re going to fuck us ALL over because they hate us ALL. I get that trans women get a lot more *visible* hate than us but if/when they come for us, they’re not going to discriminate on what kind of trans we are. The fact that we’re not cishet is enough for them.\n\nEdit: ooo I’ve made some people mad by being annoyed at my suffering being minimized. I apologize if I got a bit heated in a few comments and have removed those, I do tend to speak without thinking sometimes. But really some of y’all are just proving my point. \n\nAs for that comment saying I didn’t take “proof,” that reply (which was deleted) referenced statistics with no link to which statistics or where they were from. Sorry I don’t count someone quoting a statistic with no proof as proof.\n\nTurning off notifs for this for my own mental health, peace those who wanted an actual conversation✌️",

At the time I don't present feminine or talk to them about being trans a lot so they just forgot. Feels bad. They also buy into to ROGD type claims and made those types of arguments when I first came out. They're not actively transphobic but they don't understand the topic at all despite claiming more knowledge than I do because she watched a 12 minute HR PowerPoint once 2 years ago. They used to keep saying that they are supportive and that I'm just playing the victim and trying to frame them as bad because I \"want to say they're transphobic\". Every time we talked about it it ended in an argument and me crying, so I stopped trying to go to them for support. Because of this I'm pretty sure they think that I \"got over my phase\" because that's how they think that works. \n\nThank you for reading and listening to me vent\n\n-Kate<3",

But by the time we'd finished eating I guess she'd changed her mind because she invited me back to her place and we weren't kissing on the couch for terribly long before she invited me up to her room.\n\nOnce we got there, no time was wasted before she'd undressed, first herself and then me and then... well, to put it politely, she blew my back out.\n\nI was with a cis guy a little while ago and he was the first person I'd been intimate with since starting HRT and since before my divorce, actually. It was really nice but this was much, MUCH better! I had been scared that being with her would make me feel masculine but she made me feel like a girl the whole time. It was wonderful and sapphic and just *MMMMmmmm*\n\nShe's invited me to stay over next week and I guess I'll meet her partner (they practice Kitchen Table Polyamory). I'm really looking forward to seeing her again and feeling more confident in meeting more people now.\n\nI'm just really excited and I've been positively bubbly since yesterday.\n\nAnyways, that's my story.\n\nLater skaters!\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, I had previously thought I was immune to the \"good girl\" drug but she really only had to say it a couple of times before my pants were off. Apparently, I'm very easy to seduce *shrugs*",

I am of course very grateful for that. The place I received it in is for all sorts of surgeries, so trans surgeries are only a minor part of what they do.\n\nWhat I am not grateful for is that all the nurses that checked on me kept misgendering me and didn’t care when I corrected them about me being MTF. It was horrible to constantly be called \"he/him\" and it took away most of the hapiness about finally trimming down my Adam's apple.\n\nI think that I will write to the clinic that being treated that way gave me gender dysphoria and that they should look over their routines for dealing with transgender patients.\n\nWhat do you think?",

He followed me through several blocks while I tried to make turns and get him to leave me alone. He eventually sped in front of me and brake checked me, hit my car several times as he tried to force me off the road. And then followed me trying to block me in at every opportunity he could. Eventually I was able to get away, park, and wait for the cops (took them an hour and a half but that’s not the point of this) \n\nI was in the car with my wife and kids. On my back bumper are two magnets, one from my Alma matter. And the other is a heart with the pride flag on it. I assume the latter is what upset this guy. That or how I managed to zipper merge in front of him, im really not sure what set him off. As he was ramming into us, he was yelling all sorts of slurs out of his now rolled down passenger window, mostly about lesbians. He truly looked like he wanted to kill us. \n\nTo make things worse, my dash cam has nothing later than June 24th on it. Nothing from the incident yesterday was captured. The cops made it clear they don’t have much to go off of and honestly I don’t think he will ever be caught. My car is wrecked. My kids and wife are shaken up. And my faith in humanity continues to shrink. \n\nWe live in a very blue area of a blue state. I fear this is only the beginning. \n\nPlease. Everyone. Be careful. Get a dash cam or upgrade to a better one if you are like me and have been using the same one for years. And if you do have any indicators on your person or vehicle, like my heart, be aware that these things may be used to target you. \n\nI put this in the trans sub. Mostly because that’s who I am as a person and I care about my community, but also because I’m not 100% convinced I wasn’t initially followed because I am a trans woman. \n\nMods please feel free to remove this if you feel it doesn’t fit the sub.

The restrooms have one sign each, the gender icon followed by “toilet.” This morning, someone added an additional sign under the women’s sign that says “women’s restroom!” in bold on printer paper. Ive used this bathroom before, just not as frequently as lately. I know what they’re implying but it made me laugh if that’s what they actually are trying to say. I’m still going to use it like I have been, all my ID cards say “female” on it.

The one who was told that she couldn't correct other on her pronouns. I just got fired as of 20-30 minutes ago of writing this post. Just thought I would give an update and if anyone has any advice I would love to hear it. Story for those who don't want to click another link: My GM recently told me that I am not allowed to correct others on my pronouns. She failed to give me proper documentation and instead fired me for \"Creating a hostile work environment\". Any help would be appreciated.\n\nSmall update: I really wasn't expecting this response. Again. But ty all for the advice, sadly EEOC doesn't have any available schedules ready right now so I'm kind of ass out on the EEOC front, statements are pending and I already had an emotional meltdown. God I love autism.\n\nUpdate: Its a bit later in the night so I'm just relaxing with some friends. But guess who got her first ever concerned redditor message! Because of this post I assume!\n\nSecond update for those still here: I submitted a complaint through ACLU, I also have been busy reading comments, trying to respond and over all just trying to figure this all out. Ty for the lovely advice. I didn't know legal consultation was free. I didn't know about ACLU either and EEOC is still scheduled out. I'm going to try and get some statements also. Hope this all works out. Also as someone in DMs (which about 5 people requested to chat for various reasons.) pointed out. Happy pride. Last note. Y'all are feral. Keep up the energy. Love it. 💕💕\n\nForgot to update this all day. Been trying to get a hold of people all day. Getting ready to move, my HRT just got refilled but no way to grab it, all of this. On top of trying to find new work. Great way to end pride.\n\nUpdate: Boxes acquired for my move. Hostile... I had 3-4 old coworkers give me hugs, one of the managers gave me a sorrow goodbye and a good luck. 2 phone numbers and a stack of boxes for my move. Hostile...\n\nEdited for context: forgot to mention but they also fired me within a 90 day probationary period. Today would have been day 60.",

I like it/its not due to any dehumanising qualities, but it just feels right and gives me feelings of something vast and not fully knowable like the galaxy or ocean, terms I find that can describe my gender identity pretty well. (Plus I find the translation to sound better in my native language than the usual neutral pronouns, though I am too scared to use it irl.)  \nWell, after that she blocked me. And I got banned from the server soon after, I messaged a mod about it and got told transphobes aren't allowed and was blocked by them too.  \n  \nI know some people dislike it/its, but I do. I would never force someone to use that set, I have 3 other pronouns sets I use anyways, and I will of course not call anyone else it unless they ask me to.  \nBut now I (well mostly my annoying as fuck anxiety) am getting pretty stressed about it???

Because of how the franchise is set up, only the owner can fire managers above a certain rank. C is in training to AM at another store.\n\nBut she worked at the store I was at previously too. It's the store I worked at when I publicly came out as a trans woman. After I changed my name in the system and everyone switched to using my new name and pronouns, it came out that C was telling people my old name when they got hired on. But only a few ended up coming forward about it. She was reprimanded and continued to have a sour attitude to me even though I helped save her job and got people to stop talking bad about her.\n\nWell now I'm told today that C told another manager when I reprimanded her for yelling at our high school employees, I was screaming at her. (I wasn't, I actually had the store GM present for this talk, C did interrupt me and I did have to speak over her, but there was no yelling)\n\nShe then says \"I know she is a woman now, but when she was yelling, she was enough of a man to scare me\"\n\nI'm 8months on HRT and am not a very masculine human. I fucking hate people. I'm sick of it. So if I discipline someone I'm seen as a man??? Like what the fuck.",

My step mom wanted to use the “Oh well men have XY chromosomes and woman have XX chromosomes so you can’t possibly be a woman.” Argument. I then told her again about how I’m intersex. She literally said “well your chromosomes are being mutated from those hormones.” I shut her up when I gave her my Karyotype test that my grandmother had me take around 15 years old cause we noticed I had really feminine features (egg phase). Grandmother agreed not to share the results out of my privacy but I figured fuck it. it was dated 2018 in December. I started medical transition a year ago. I have XXY chromosomes and there’s not a single biology reason her or any transphobe can use to explain that I’m a “male.” But even with that it goes without saying gender isn’t just your chromosomes or genitalia. In short “fuck the transphobes who wanna claim I’m a male due to my chromosomes cause for all intents and purposes I am biologically male and female!\nEdit: for anyone commenting on my dad I appreciate the sentiment, and yes my dad wouldn’t stand for this but he died when I was a child so…",

Best case were \"you have high E for a trans person, let's wait until it goes down so you get tested more accurately\" (my levels were mostly fine). \n\nSeeing a lot of posts here about \"I had XYZ issue, doctors asked me to stop E forever\", or \"my doctors said I can't take T. I guess that's it\". \n\nSo here is a little secret from having had some friends in the medical fields - most doctors think that trans people should never do HRT. Very few doctors (even in trans-friendly clinics) actually want people to transition, because they see it as an \"needless risk\" or \"last-resort\". \n\nIf someone tells you that your levels are high, or a health issues is connected to E -> it most likely isn't. It' just Trans Broken Arm Syndrome. ",

Deeply unsettled, I just unfriended him and his wife. While I was good friends with his wife I just couldn't help but feel she probably agreed with him. \n\nWoke up to her demanding to know why I unfriended her and that \"she only agrees with SOME of what he says\". I told her flat out I'm uncomfortable with that and didn't want to remain friends. \n\nHere's the kicker. I'm semi well known around Facebook art communities. she's a new artist aspiring to be big. I posted on my FB wall the situation, didn't name names, and asked my friends if I should make a warning post so folks were aware of her husband's transphobia. \n\nHer husband lost his entire mind! He commented on it (I had it public) and threatened me with a law suit while also spewing even MORE transphobia. Saying stuff like \"I just don't want trans in my bathrooms because they're predators!\" \n\nHe claimed he would sue me for defamation if I \"ruined his wife's career\" and that he's going to \"unleash hell upon me\". I screen shotted everything and told him he's the reason I'm about to write an entire post about him. My friends jumped in to defend me and his wife outwardly continued to support him. \n\nIt was insane. Eventually he got wise after spouting a bunch more transphobia and deleted his comments. Just. Wild ride. Im still reeling. Anyways, I just wanted to share this very strange situation. If I get a cease and desist letter I'm going to laugh like no ones business. ",

They deleted the policy, even after experts, community leaders, and over a hundred students told them that bullying and violence against trans kids would result.\n\nYesterday, riding a wave of outrage in a surge of turnout to the polls, voters in Union elected Rachel Wilcox, while voters in Waldoboro elected Benjamin Stickney and Leah Shipps.  These new board members have committed to policies that protect trans students’ safety.\n\nBy a wide margin, voters rejected fundamentalist candidate Steve Karp, who had also vowed to ban books from the library because they contained ideas he did not like.\n\nhttps://knox.villagesoup.com/news/rsu-40-board-majority-shifts-with-election-results-in-four-races/article_051c7b60-2858-11ef-8846-43b27346d967.html",

With full support of everyone who knows. \n\nSo I made an appointment with him a few days ago. I've know this man since I was a teenager. I'm 31 now.\n\nIt went well at first. He seemed supportive and told me he had other trans patients\n\nbut when I told him I wanted a vaginoplasty he said the hospital I am on a waiting list for (for hormones and medical operations.) \"Did a really nice job, yes a REALLY NICE job.\" The way he said it made me feel a small red flag. \n\nHe went on complimenting my voice, saying it wasn't that low \"If I even close my eyes, I could imagine a girl sitting in front of me.\" I myself think my voice is on the lower side but that could be dysporia talking because other people have said my voice is pretty high. (Not in that way though.😅)\n\nWhen I asked for something to lower my libido (I'm sorry I forgot the name, I'm pretty forgetfull.😅) his demeanor changed. He said he didn't wanna give it. I should wait until I had access to an Endocrinologist. He didn't want to take away my orgasms. \"If you want to dress up as a girl and masturbate that's totally okay.\" I felt so icky when he said that. My first response was saying \" It's not about that, it's REALLY not about that!\" I know he might have meant that it's allright to experiment but I felt really bad about it. Like he tought i was just a sexual pervert.\n\nI still had the urge to masturbate but it feels more like a chore than pleasure and I felt really bad when I orgasmed I was thinking of maybe buying a wand and doing it the girl way but after that the need has subsided. I don't know if I'm overreacting but it just feels really icky.\n\nAfter that he talked about some more stuff (I coudnt really focus.) And congratulated me on my bravery of coming out.\n\nAm I overthinking this? I spent years thinking my trans feelings were just a transformation fetish and this meeting made it feel like a step backwards in the closet. I want to be a woman in every sense of the word, not just because of sexual pleasure but because I know I'll feel so much better and confident as one.\n\nThanks for reading.

I walk up to him he recognizes me as my brothers sister and I say you got a pretty lady around your arm. He goes what are you talking about. I say isn’t that your girlfriend and point behind me. She’s quite the distance away but she’s close enough that she can definitely hear our conversation. There’s and awkward silence, like 10 seconds pass and he goes yea I don’t know that bitch she looks like a f****t. I’m left speechless and he just walks off LEAVES THE GAS STATION AND DRIVES OFF WITHOUT HER. \n\n\nI apologize to her and she just says he’s moody. We awkwardly say bye and I head back to my friend. She stands outside with both smoothies in her hand until he comes back 20 minutes later to pick her up. \n\n\nI’m so heartbroken that she was treated like that. She’s soo beautiful and he doesn’t even want to acknowledge her as a significant other. She and all trans women deserve someone that will love them for who they are",

    "selftext": "Was at a bar during a open mic night and it was mostly music acts. Sometimes comics would come up and do things but nothing much more.\n\nMe(Obviously trans) and my friend who is an egg(Questioning) were sitting in the corner booth watching the acts. The bar isnt a LGBTQ bar, but its very accepting and doesnt take kindly to anyone who's hateful, so bear that in mind.\n\nWe saw a group of trans girls come in and my friend got a little anxious. She was happy to have moved to the city recently and arent used to being around other trans people or even seeing them proudly being theirselves, so shes very much in culture shock sometimes.\n\nAfter a pretty good local band plays, one of the girls we saw come in, gets announced to do poetry, which isnt something people at this bar hear alot, but no one was against it at all. We all listened to her poem about something and she got VERY into it. Screaming and yelling into the mic about this tragity that happened somewhere. \n\nWhen she was done, everyone was just kindve doing their thing and the girl turns and stares at our booth for just enough time to make it uncomfy. She obviously wasnt happy that people didnt immediately cheer, but thats what happens when you bring slam poetry about a shooting into a bar known for Free Bird and light Comedy. They immediately leave the bar out of frustration that only a couple people clapped and not everyone.\n\nAfter a few minutes, my friend says she's getting tired and wants to go back to the apartment so I walk out with her, only to find the group of trans girls out front, smoking. My friend decides to say that she enjoyed her poem, but... Things went downhill after that.\n\nThe girl looks at my friend and goes, \"Dont lie to me. You are supposed to support your own people, not ignore. Thats why we are looked down on, is because people like you refuse to support trans art\"\n\nI openly said in defense, \"Hey, we actually clapped and listened to all of it. Im sorry, but its not our fault that you brought slam poetry into a bar full of people who havent heard slam poetry\"\n\nShe then has the audacity to yell at me that I know nothing about art and that Im transphobic for not supporting her work... The work I did support openly in public not 10 minutes before... \n\nAt this point my friend is shaking and almost crying, so I grabbed her and walked away. She kept saying in the car, \"She was so mean. We're just like her. Why was she so mean to us when we're just like her\".\n\nShe saw first hand tonight that being trans doesnt make you less of an pretentious asshole. You can take all the hormones in the world, but that doesnt change how much of a tool you are.",

Then I asked my other friend he said “shouldn’t be legal” this broke me and we talked for a while longer and he then said he was far right on the political scale. He went to say he saw it as a form of genital mutilation I didn’t really speak to him since then. Fast forward a month or so later he messaged me on snap saying “can we sort things out or no”. We ended up chatting and i told him the truth he asked me “why do you think you’re trans” this isn’t a question that one can answer I said “well what makes you think you are not trans” he said “well i have dick and i like girls” i’m glad he felt content in his own body i suppose. I told him how I cry most nights wishing i wasn’t trans i wish i could be happy in my own body. Then he kept on asking why i wanted to be a girl i just do i suppose. I then asked him if his opinion had changed if he felt any different about trans people and he said “yeah i tolerate them” he then asked why i didn’t know if i was trans he said i should just know.

I awoke early, got myself looking as pretty as possible, and left the house. \n\nFYI, I'm only 5 months on E, and obviously trans. So I arrived at the location and found the entrance which was on the actual shipping dock. \n\nKeep in mind that I always have heightened anxiety when I leave the house enfemme, and today was worse due to the added pressure of wanting to make a good impression.  \n\nAs I'm walking to the door, I'm trying to simultaneously hype myself up, calm myself down, and gather my confidence. I grabbed the door handle, exhaled one last cleansing breath, and pulled open the door. \n\nAs I took my first step through the doorway, a startling, almost deafening alarm blared through this enormous warehouse. As 30+ dock workers snapped their heads up to look, I shyly backed out the door, sat on the steps, and started to have an anxiety attack. \n\nLess than a minute later, a young woman peeked out the door and kindly said, \"Can I help you?\" I muttered, \"I'm here for orientation.\" She said, \"This is it, baby, c'mon in!\" I followed her into the office where a gentleman took my information. I guess I was still obviously a nervous wreck because as soon as I sat down he said, \"Relax, hun, you're ok.'\", and I finally did calm down and settle in. \n\nI was certainly grateful for their kindness, but it is discouraging that presenting as my authentic self causes me to almost have mini strokes at times 😕 Even though I probably bring most of it on myself, it sucks that trying to be comfortable can cause me so much discomfort.. I hope it eventually evens out further down my transition path. \n\ntysm for reading 😊  ~kaylee🩷💕",

I have no idea what the hell went wrong since COVID, but I wanna know what happened that made everyone turn on trans people so much and even start making up their own stories about how transitioning works?\n\nI remember before COVID and when people spent less time on social media, trans people were mostly ignored. Like, yeah, if you told people you were trans they would be either confused or would hatecrime you for it (terrible still), but nobody was really spreading this moral panic that affected our rights. That's how I remember it at least. \n\nAnd I just wanna know where did this whole idea of 'us' cutting off kids' penises and mutilating their vaginas come from? Cause it's such an extreme and derogatory accusation. I'm aware it's mostly a social media problem because I don't really hear about these discussions irl as much, but social media affects the public and makes them hate us. It increases the risk of hatecrime by putting these disgusting, misinformed ideas into people's brains.\n\nLike hello???? People are genuinely caring more about trans people just wanting to exist than pedophiles and rapists being allowed to roam around freely. I'm also sure if you asked any of these \"protect children\" people why they never talk about things such as FGM and castrations, it would be silence. Cause they don't care. At all. Honestly, what the hell is going on with society atp????\n",

I honestly shouldn't have expected more from a heavily Christian school, but I really did believe they would at least do the tiniest ounce of research before teaching a whole year group on a sensitive and stigmatised subject. \n\nThe principle took over this unit - and it wasn't even like he was teaching us. It was like he was just participating in a gossip session about trans people with the class, saying absurd shit like;\n\n\"Isn't it funny how MEN who present themselves as a woman are always so over the top and exaggerate women? I've never seen any women do or say those things except for men who say they are.\"\n\n\"It's always very obvious to tell if they're a man.\"\n\n(The conversation was very weirdly hyperfixated on transwoman, and it was disgusting to say the least)\n\nWe have this question box where people can just anonymously write down a question, put it in the box, and somewhere in the unit it'll get picked out and answered. Well, I wrote if LGBTQ+ individuals were accepted in this school - including the fact that many of my former friends who are apart of that community faced several backlash and didn't feel as if they were.\n\nThe principle then went on this unrelated rant on how It's actually THEIR own fault that they don't feel accepted. He said, \"relationships in general aren't allowed in the school. But your friends don't think the rule applies to them because they're gay, so when they got into a relationship and get told off for it, they think they're being oppressed but its their own fault.\" Which is hilariously untrue because 1. My friends never dated within the school. And 2. The backlash WE recieved wasn't anything to do with that rule, I don't know where the fuck he got that from, but it was from the disgusting things teachers and students have said many times before. He didn't even answer the question and just shifted the blame over to my friends who he made up an outlandish scenario about.\n\nThen he ended the lesson off with, \"don't come out of this lesson thinking its okay to be LGBTQ+. It's a choice and a sin that needs to be repented.\"\n\nI've never felt so insignificant.",

Anyways, I felt because it's my senior year of high school, I'd tell the very few people I trust that I'm trans. I mean, if it got out, it's not like I'd be around all that long anyway, right? One person I told was the art teacher's daughter, we'll call her M. I've known M since, like elementary school, our families are really close, and I can't let my family know I'm trans for religious reasons. So understandably, telling her made me quite nervous. I met her in the hallway and asked her if she wanted to know a secret on the condition she told absolutely nobody. The art teacher was in the hall supervising the students leaving, so we went into her dad's room and I showed her a little trans flag I made. Immediately, she exploded with excitement. She knew what it was and asked me in disbelief, \"You're trans?!\" And then she started jumping up and down and clapping her hands. I nodded yes and went to leave, but she stopped me and whispered to me, \"Do you have a preferred name?\" And I told her I hadn't decided on one yet. She then whispered to me, expressing that she believes in me in regard to my transition.\n\nI've thought about her reaction every day since then. It's been at least three days since I told her. The day after, I thanked her in math for her support, and she lit up the room with a smile and said super endearingly, \"You're welcome!\"",

I’m in my apt with my Gf pacing and I’m like “babe, what if I got him to sign the titties on my Hook-ups board?” \nI sat around in contemplation, she thought I was silly. Well I did two things \n1. I messaged him on a social and just straight up asked. \nAnd then \n2. Walked down there, and ended up running into one of his openers that was smoking in the alley. He told me to come by after the show by the bus bc he always loves meeting and taking pics. \n\nSo I rush home and I’m like “babe we gotta go back in a few hours!” \nSo I sit down to get some annual training done and I check my phone and see the magic little icon that “steveo is typing”.\n\nDudes like “yeah come on through! Told security to let the girl with the board come knock on the bus door”\n\nSo just like that I’m in steveos tour bus with my gf getting my board signed. I thanked him for all the awesome stuff he’s done for things a lot of people don’t care about (#fuckseaworld)  and he put us on his guest list for the show! \n\nFlash forward to two minutes before the show and I miss a message from him bc I have my notis off by that point. Saying in short “hey I got this message from somebody grilling me  about my openers joke content and I was wondering if you and your girlfriend wouldn’t mind telling me what you feel about it and if this person is being over sensitive.” \n\nI’m like HOLY SHIT \nSteveo is asking me for advice on a matter? What alternate timeline did my ass just walk into for myself? \n\nI gave him our thoughts and he thanked us for the input. \n\nThen it dawns on me. \n“Wait a minute..?” \n\nDid steveo make a connection of “hey I just got this message yesterday and just met a trans lesbian and her cis girlfriend who seemed to appreciate the work I do, I think I’ll ask their input on this matter” \n\nIn the end I appreciate the guy so much more now. He’s so kind and humbled and I just couldn’t be happier with such an awesome night. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I’m taking an HCA class today where we’re being taught how to clean catheters and genital areas. One of the mannequins had boobs and was wearing a more feminine shirt and had makeup, but also had a penis. One person commented “they need to fix the mannequin so it’s correct”. Another commented “It threw me off”. When it was my turn to practice, I said “I’m assuming my client’s pronouns are she/her and will be addressing her as such”. A couple minutes later, someone said “I’m thinking about the pronoun thing. Wouldn’t it be a she/he? Cuz the top half is a she and the bottom half is a he. I mean I don’t know what “it” is.” And everyone laughed. Some people seemed like they didn’t think that combination was even possible. The whole time, I just felt so uncomfortable. I’m on the verge of tears to be honest. If they knew I had a flat chest, facial hair, etc, but I don’t have a penis, what would they say? I don’t think they’d see me as human. They respect me rn. I just hate it here😅\n\nETA: I tried saying things to stop them. I eventually gave up, cuz they were just that ignorant/rude. I didn’t have time to talk to the teacher (who was involved in laughing at the “jokes”). And I don’t know who I would contact about it (we get a new teacher almost every day and I don’t remember her name, or who her boss is). The point of this post wasn’t to find solutions. I just needed to get it off my chest because it was a really triggering thing that happened and I wanted people who would understand to stand in solidarity with me. So I don’t feel like a freak or inhuman from their words. So I know there are others out there that feel the same hurt and can understand me. So yeah… If you could stop trying to give solutions, I’d appreciate it. Thanks! 💙",

    "selftext": "1. There will be a labour shortage from the \"deportation\" of \"undesirables\". It's going to drive up food prices especially, and the tariffs are going to drive up everything else. It would be wise to stock up on anything you physically can, though I would prioritise grain and starch because of how hard they are to grow and process in a garden. Maybe try getting a few chickens if you can, since they're not too labour intensive to support\n2. The infrastructure is going to have a hard time because of refugees from elsewhere in the US. It would be extremely prudent to start preparing it for the inevitable strain.\n3. The \"deportations\" are likely to follow the same playbook as before 2020, where the targets ended up in impromptu containment areas with inhumane living conditions. You need to take in any POC you can and hide them among you, because getting them out of those containment areas is going to be a whole bunch harder than just making sure they don't get taken in the first place. Of course, prioritise those who are willing. Kidnapping isn't what we stand for\n4. If you have any disposable income or the ability to flee the US, I strongly suggest considering allocating some income to supporting efforts to get vulnerable people to solidly blue areas. The more people we get out of their reach, the less labour they can exploit, and the weaker they become overall. Do keep in mind that there are pockets of red everywhere and there are people in pretty much every neighbourhood who are very enthusiastic about the plans in the works. I would also suggest getting a bit of an exchange program going with areas that are predominantly occupied by POC, since pockets with large amounts of vulnerable people would be easiest for them to exploit\n5. ETA: If you can, arm yourself. No matter where you are. Doesn't have to be a firearm, anything is better than nothing at all. If you can afford it, get a shotgun. They don't require the most amount of skill to use and work great in tight spaces and for self defence\n6. ETA2: If you can, form a tenant's union and make sure you can shelter at least one person with you. Rent's going to go up and keep going up, and forming the unions before the union busters get a massive funding boost would be smart. We can't allow someone's profit to stand in the way of the survival of millions of people\n\nETA3: I've made a handful of other posts, and I'll link them here as they get approved.

I only used \"they\" considering we never discussed each others pronouns, I figured it was pretty common knowledge that unless discussed beforehand, \"they\" is an acceptable term to refer to a stranger as if you don't know how they identify, out of respect.\n\nI paused awkwardly because I'm not really good with confrontation and I couldn't fathom why this person looked so genuinely upset, even the worker looked uncomfortable. After a few seconds I quickly apologized with, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know, if I had known you used he/it I wouldn't have used \"they\". I only used it because I wanted to be respectful and didn't know how you identified. It wont happen again.\"\n\nI was then met with \"Yeah, well I'm NOT non-binary or whatever. I don't want to be grouped with that.\"\n\nAnd then I paused again, thinking, \"Is this person who's under the transgender umbrella simultaneously enby-phobic?\"\n\nGenuine curiosity got the better of me and I asked why he thought that way, and he said that it was because of all the \"neo-pronoun bullshit\" and \"making up terms that don't need to exist for attention, making the rest of the trans community look bad\".\n\nThen he threw in the word \"trans trender\" and I immediately knew where the conversation was going. I shook my head, grabbed my black hair dye, went to the counter and left in a flabbergasted state.\n\nUSING THE TERM \"TRANS-TRENDER\" IN 2024?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\n\nThe person looked to be around 15-16 years old so I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but damn. It felt like I was having a conversation with the reincarnate of Kalvin Garrah for a hot minute. I am now reluctant to go back to that Sally's location because I don't want to run into him again. I understand having your own opinions about the current state of the trans community but holy shit dude, there's no need to be hateful.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Well, what the title says. I'm currently very close to graduating from college, which means Russian military complex wishes to snatch me right after that. \n\nSo I'm looking for pro gamer tips and trcks on how to evade that. Preferably from Russian AMAB folks who managed to successfully do so in the last two years.  \n\nAll I know of is spending some time at a mental hospital, getting diagnozed with something mental. Like depression. And I'm open to that idea. The problem is me being a pussy, getting real nervous around people and stuff, so I need collect all my willpower for that. \n\nAnd I'd like to learn how not to accidentally out myself to a possibly transphobic therapist. \nIf you got other ideas, feel free to share. \n\n\nSo, somewhat of an FAQ based on the feedback I got:\n\n- I can't continue my education right now, because, as mentioned above, they want to get me right after I leave the college. I don't have time to apply to another place. Also it needs to be a higher degree to give me a postponement. \n\n- **Mate, what's the period when American and European unis accept applications? Like, omg, I'm to be drafted by 27th of June. If it's later than that... Well, first I gotta evade being drafted in June, and then I can apply. The date of my thesis is stil to be announced, so I hope it'll be late.**\n\n- I can't just leave the country, I'm not allowed to during the conscription season.\n\n- I can't get into the alternative service right now. Should've thought about that before the consription started. I'm a lil dum-dum. Also there's a chance of them saying \"screw you, you're serving in the military, we don't care if you don't want to even touch a gun\".\n\n- I can't legally transition. It's been banned last year or so. And I didn't transition earlier because I'm living with my parents, who are incredibly queerphobic. Like, my dad is capable of whining about me wearing a shirt too long.\n\n- I'm not living in Moscow. I'm like literally in the middle of the country. I can't blow up the Kremlin. I also can't walk my way to Finland (or any other European country) on a whim.\n\n**A funky lil update, guys, gals and gexes.**\n\nSo, today I went to college for some stuff. I also asked when will our thesis defense be held. It'll be June 24th or 25th, which is before my drafting, meaning the military commissariat will have a chance to snatch me.\n\nBut my teachers are also of the opinion that military service is cringe, especially now, with the war happening. So, they helped me to book the apointment at a psychiatrist. I'd be too nervous to do so on my own. I hope this'll work out alright.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note. Just watched Godzilla Minus One. Damn it's good. And got a quote that'll live in my head rent free for about a week. \"It is precisely something to be proud of... that you have never been to war.\" So good. This movie made me cry like three or four times.",

After that, I simply turned around, shouted, \"Bristol doesn't want you,\" and walked off without looking back, flipping the middle finger high in the air.

The stream would often splash back at me and even at the toilet when growing up, I never really had the best aim.\n\nSo I always sat down every time at the toilet because that’s just what made me more comfortable. Eventually my mom and dad told me that the only time you should sit down is when you need to poop cause only women sat down to pee.\n\nI know a vagina isn’t really something you can control the stream like a penis can so it’s hard for them to stand while peeing, but why did we collectively decide that men should be standing while peeing? If anything, they should be sitting while peeing because then the entire stream makes it into the toilet. \n\nI feel like it’s just way more hygienic to sit while peeing because then you don’t accidentally make a giant mess if your stream decides to hate you that day and go places you don’t want it to go. And don’t even get me started on how uncomfortable it feels to be at a urinal. Especially with those people who pull their pants all the way down instead of just undoing their zipper. \n",

But there's been so many it's been overwhelming to respond.\n\nFinal update on this post: I sent the email (finally) to my GM. Now to wait for a response. Made sure to detail what we talked about, time and date. If she doesn't get back to me then I'm just going to ignore the issue cause obviously it's bogus.

It really does. I haven't had issues all day with pronouns so that's a bonus. Probably cause I let people know what is going on. She never said I couldn't talk about it. I'm not under an NDA.

Since puberty it transformed into something I don't appreciate, something I don't recognize, something that does not represent who I am.\n \n\nIt feels degrading and almost dehumanizing. Everytime I look in the mirror, everytime someone refers to me in a way that isn't true to my identity, it all makes me feel such disconnection and helplessness. \n\n\nThey say to be human, you must be recognized as such by another. But if I'm not recognized as a woman, then what in the world am I? \n\n\nThe way society reacts to all this \"horror\" we're experiencing certainly doesn't help either. We're shamed and rejected, sometimes even abused and physically threatened, and at worse times killed. As if we already weren't killing ourselves on the inside. \n\n\nEven when they don't react violently, the hurt of their words competes with that of their punched and their stabs. They say \"You're faking it\", \"you're seeking attention\" or \"there's something wrong with you\". And there *is*, something wrong. It's not what they say is wrong, it's that we were born in bodies that don't feel like our own, and that we're mistreated everytime we try doing something about it. \n\n\nPeople say that jokingly, but it really does feel like a \"flesh prison\" of sorts. \n\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry if this is depressing, but it's how I feel.

I’m just pointing out he was paraplegic because it was different from someone who could actually attack me. \nI was in control in the situation for once.\nI’ve had situations when I was just starting where guys would come at me.

You weren't gendered *correctly*. You had your gender *affirmed*!\"\n\nI think I get what he was trying to say. That I *am* a woman and it's not a matter of getting it \"correct\" but rather that I was validated and acknowledged by these women.\n\nBut, ***bitch! Don't correct me on my own jargon!*** It's validating and affirming ***because it's correct!***\n\nAnyway, I just thought it was funny.\n\nLater skaters.\n\nEdit: It's been pointed out that his use of language might be problematic and it reminded me of something. A few times, in place of gender dysphoria or incongruence, he's used the phrase \"gender misappropriation\". I always thought it sounded odd but in terms of my treatment, I've never felt as though there was any discrimination and he's always seemed supportive of my transition.

    "selftext": "Okay so I've officially came out to close family around two years ago, came out in general for around 5 years now, im ftm. I still haven't medically transitioned and mom is not very supportive. She knows about the things that make me uncomfortable, one of those things is my deadname but she's lately just pretending im not trans to deal with it i guess. We have gotten into countless of arguments due to her ignorance but she still doesn't seem to really care. A few hours ago she send me a pic of her wearing a necklace with my deadname on her neck and asked if i like it. I can't believe the audacity of this woman. I've been doing good lately but this has made me very upset cause it feels intentional. What and how do i reply to this without going way too low?\n\nNOTE: Okay first of all thank you so SO much for all your kind comments and the votes, i fell asleep and woke up to all those ppl!! I didn't expect to get so much interaction, last time i dared to post here it was a disaster, i got some trolls, some copy paste replies and my post got taken down which made me regret ever posting. Again thank you so much for the advice im trying my best to read everything and reply to as many things as i can. YOU'RE ALL THE BESTT.\n\nUPDATE 1: Okay so small update, I haven't replied yet, (mostly cause i was reading through comments to see what ill do) so I didn't interact with what she sent me at all yet but in the morning i got a call. She was asking me if I've seen what she sent me but me being me she could tell by the way i was talking that i was upset. Long story short she kept asking and pushing as to why i was upset and if she did something wrong but i was tired and just replied with. \"I don't know take a wild guess as to why im upset\" and haven't picked up the phone since. I feel a little like an asshole but i couldn't help it. I will update soon when i send my reply to her and see what she says. \n\nUPDATE 2: I apologise for the delay but finally i have a full update on the situation, again i can't thank you guys enough for all the responses i couldn't have done it without you all. I send a huge paragraph not just about the necklace but things in general, about her disrespecting me by calling me my dead name and how she wasn't supportive of my identity still despite all the time I've given her to adjust. And long story short that i can't imagine having a future relationship with her if she continues on like that, the message was basically a mix of most messages here. She sent \"i love you no matter what, i just want you to be happy and healthy\", but I didn't know what to think cause I've heard that before, along with the \"i support you\" but then she doesn't. There's a chance that she believes that because she didn't kick me out and ignores my identity that she supports me?? (She has actually told me that but during an argument). \n\nAnyways left it at that and then i  came home. Stepdad was there and she was still wearing the necklace which made me very sad, basically nothing changed. She kept hugging me and all but i could literally hear her and see her signaling to stepdad things like. \"See i told you\" \"it passes quickly\" and basically talking to me like how you talk when a baby gets upset about something stupid but you comfort them still. It made me very upset didn't let her near me after that, still getting treated as if i got a tumtrum same with stepdad. I tried my hardest not to show it and i didn't in the end i just ended up going to my room. At night we sat and talked then watched a movie, which i did get a little petty as many suggested since the message didn't seem to help much and called her a mans name. I messed with her for a while, she was like what are you saying and i was like no that's your name. that's when she realised what i was doing. Called her that in front of stepdad too which embarassed her but i dropped it afterwards. We were watching the movie and she kept staring at me but i said nothing. \n\nGood ending i guess? Cause next morning she took the necklace off completely and put it in a drawer. For the first time i saw her put actual effort in avoiding to say my deadname and since then she has been barely saying it. She hasn't said a thing about the message but i see this as a win and progress. Im so happy, it's a big step and im looking forward for hopefully more progress and for hopefully a conversation to strike regarding my message. This is the last update thank you all for the 100th time, spreading lots of love 💪",

Because me too!”\n\n(I barely know any trans people in real life, and he was older than me). \n\nHe said “no way!!! I couldn’t even tell.” And didn’t believe me. Then weirdly he looked down at my chest (which isn’t even large? I have a rather small chest, thankfully). And said “oh yeah I can tell”. Like oh, thanks, but ouch…?\n\nLmao, just felt like sharing this weird encounter. He was cool nonetheless I was just like:(.  ",

I guess he could tell I was sad because he walked back over and politely told me “I think you’re very beautiful and I have nothing against trans woman, it’s just not for me.” I scoffed and said “who said I’m trans?” and he pointed at my friend. She watched the interaction go down, I immediately left the club and they all followed after me.. I’ll call her Tina, Tina exclaimed that she just didn’t want me to get hurt and thought it’d be better if she told him now vs him finding out on his own later, and that she was just worried for my safety and wanted to make sure he was trans friendly before things went any further with us. Bullshit. She knew what she was doing. She knows how I handle these situations and that I can take care of myself in this regard. Cutting her out of my life for good. Be careful ladies… some of these cis women will act like your #1 supporter just to sabotage you the first chance they get. ",

I don't expect anyone to remember this post, but this community was pretty helpful, so I will update it for the sake of people that gave me advice.\n\n\nI took everyone's advice into consideration and I decided to try and befriend Maria. It wasn't difficult, since I was one of the rare people that didn't bully or mock her.\n\n\nSince the country I was in has pretty fundamental views about everything, there was no therapist that I could consult. So, at the beginning it was difficult, with all indoctrinated views I had on the matter. I would focus to just listen to her talk, so I don't say something that would offend her. Only talking when she asked me about something.\n\n\nAround that time thet stopped the physical bullying, as I always made a point to be with Maria around the time when they would bully her (Lunch break, after school.), so they eventually got bored. That didn't stop them from insulting her at every opportunity, but I would always deescalate the situation. But, judging from her reaction, words didn't bother her all that much.\n\n\nAt this point in time, bullying is nonexistent. People who used to torture her would now just ignore her. Even when I'm not at school, my bwst friend would make sure that they don't start again.\n\n\nShe got a lot more confident too, managed to make a few more friends, which I'm extremely glad about as she was shy and distant when I first approached her.\n\n\nWhile I'm still weirded out sometimes by the concept, it's a lot easier to talk to Maria and to see her like every other girl from my class.\n\n\nThank you everyone for your advice and criticism, you guys have been great help.",

Men can’t look like women, because that’s shameful and less than.\n\nMy favourite people are women. Women are amazing. And just like the trans community, they’re fighting an uphill battle for equitable rights and credibility in society. They also have cuter shoes and way better clothes; and they make men’s clothes look better too. \n\nSo, today, frustrated, I decided on visibility. Not because I pass, or because I’m ready, but as an act of protest against the culture that says “no”.\n\nAnd you know what? It was fine. I didn’t look perfect. I looked genderqueer. I’m pre everything, and I’m unsure if I’ll ever be post anything. \n\nAnd I’m gonna do it again, and soon.

It was supposed to lessen or stop my periods. I ended up having a 2 week (+) long period. When i went to the doctors about it, she said that a period that long plus my normally heavy bleeding classes as a hemorrhage and i had low iron levels, so i got prescribed iron. This was about a month ago, and i was already in the process to getting T. This was just a thing to try to stop my periods and lessen the dysphoria for now. Anyway, the period stopped only a day or two after i stopped taking them. And here i am now. Tomorrow, i have another appointment with my endocrine, and as long as theres no problems (which there isn't. All of my problems are already diagnosed and confirmed by the endocrine that they raise no issues in starting T), I'll be at least getting prescribed T by tomorrow. I hope all goes well. I hate the idea of waiting until I'm 19 to start T. It's only a couple of months, but those months would be filled with dysphoria and depression for me.

The constant sexual undertones and jokes and downplaying of SA, and objectification of women. I genuinly think that 80% of anime is super creepy except for some more niche/indie series.\n\nLike genuinly WTF Japan.\n\nEdit: and to \"yeaaah, but...\" -> a show that doesn't have fanservice every 5 min call still be problematic, especially when relationships between male and female characters are based on one gloryfying or objectifying the other, especially with teenagification/babification...\n\nEdit2: Dunegeon Meshi gets a full pass\n\nEdit3: Wasn't expecting so much rampant mysoginy on a trans subreddit. Yall are too ok with casual portrays of SA",

However, when I expressed this to a transgender group, they got angry with me and insisted that I'm trans no matter what.\n\nThis feels like I'm being forced to make the mistake of my assigned gender at birth a permanent part of my identity. I believe that if I identify as a woman, my identity should be respected without qualifiers. After all, cisgender women aren't constantly expected to identify as \"cis women.\"\n\nI understand that some trans people find pride and community in the transgender label, and I respect that. However, I feel that my personal choice to identify solely as a woman should also be respected. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Should every trans person be expected to identify as trans, or is it okay for some of us to simply identify as our true gender without the trans label?",

I don't really know the first one, he is a quiet guy who doesn't really mess with anyone or do anything. The problems come with the second guy. Let's call him Alan.\n\nWell I met Alan a couple years ago on another trip and I've gone on several with him. When he was younger he was kind of a brute, playing pretty rough and stuff, but he knew where to draw lines and seemed to be growing more mature but this year we went to different classes in september. When I met him again this travel he had changed. He started laughing about \"nazi good, minority bad\" \"jokes\" and expressing fascist points of view unironically and acting pretty cold with me. I knew he had been struggling with acohol and substance abuse and his parents divorce but I never expected him to go down this route. \n\nAt first I tried to be friendly. He's been through a rough patch and we've all had phases. But he didn't seem to care about that, or about the fact that I was a human being. Every time I was in the room Alan would direct comments at what he considered \"my weakness\", calling me homophobic and transphobic slurs and in the latest days even trowing objects or hitting me and playing it off as a joke.\n\nAs I hope you'll understand, I wasn't quite happy with this. Yesterday we had a clash when I threw back back one of the fruits Alan had been throwing it me, we didn't get into a fight because the quiet guy was able to take him away. Today that didn't happen.\n\nThings got even worse today than before and at one point he hit me very badly in the neck while going past me, again trying to play it off as a joke. I got really, really mad and threw a bag that was nearby at him and then Alan jumped at me. I don't really remenber anything about that exchange other than the fact that he tried to choke me (fortunately failed) but was able to open a pretty big breach on my head. Then my other roomate was able to get him off me. That was a few hours ago. Alan is getting hammered next door and I am sitting in the bed of our room waiting for this whole shitshow to be over.

After this she started yelling at me and started saying things about how there would have been signs from an early age and I didn’t really seem like I was trans and I started crying and went to my room, she followed after a bit and continued yelling, I continued crying and yelled at her to get her to fuck off. My dad tried to brake up the fight and started telling us both to stop, he also told me to go on a walk with him, I said I did not want to but he kept persisting, he then made me and my brother go downstairs with him (My brother was caught in the crossfire of the fight as everyone was yelling). While downstairs my dad started asking me questions about how I knew I was trans while I was crying (I had responded “it just feels right” which is not a good response at all and didn’t help at all). My mom came downstairs soon after and continued yelling which did not help, my dad got her to stop for a bit and she went upstairs. After around 15 mins my dad, my brother, and I went on a walk where nothing really happened and I didn’t really talk to either. At the end of the walk I told my dad why I felt like I was trans (im not comfortable with my body and certain organs and being male doesn’t feel correct at all) and he said that I could be wrong and it is just teenage hormones and I haven’t considered other options (I’ve been thinking about this for around 6-7 months which is not long at all but my thoughts haven’t really changed) and that’s basically it.\n\n\nEdit: wow, I did not expect that many people to care this much, thank you. Also, I do not want to discourage anyone else who wants to come out, most people will be accepting and will love the real you.\n\nEdit 2: My mom tried to talk to me again, what she said basically boils down to last year being tough and I might be depressed but this is crazy and life altering in a bad way, my brain is still growing and changing and I am being affected by hormones way too much, and I am jumping into this too fast and labeling myself when I shouldn’t.",

We've been together over a decade. \n\nThis past summer my egg cracked and I realized I had been suppressing my gender my whole life. I came out to my wife, and she was absolutely shocked. We both started therapy. \n\nOver the course of the next few months, she started questioning her own sexuality. At first, she thought she might be demi sexual. She decided she doesn't care about the gender of a person, but rather she cares about their mind and her emotional connection to them. Because of this, our marriage could work as I transition, because our love was stronger than gender. \n\nThen, she slowly realized that she might actually be a lesbian. She started recalling memories of her childhood and teenage years of having crushes on girls, always being attracted to girls, always wanting to touch them and kiss them. But she was raised in a bigoted household and was a dutiful daughter, and so she suppressed all those feelings and convinced herself she was straight. \n\nThat's perfect for us, right?\n\nUnfortunately, with this newfound discovery, she started cheating on me with a woman. We are now getting a divorce. I'm devastated, and they're happy as two lovebirds. \n\nHer bigoted parents have told her she's going to hell for it, and say I'm mentally ill for wanting to be a woman. And they blame her lesbian relationship on me for coming out as trans, claiming that coming out was a rejection of her as a woman and that's why she started cheating. It's my fault she cheated and it's my fault it was with a woman. Her mom says she just needs a good fucking from the right man to set her straight again, and she needs to start seeing men to prove it to herself. She won't; she is firmly convinced she is a lesbian and she's ready to be her authentic self - just not with me. \n\nSo now I'm transitioning alone, and also going through a divorce, and also dealing with her parents and my parents who are fully against all of this. \n\nThis is so damn hard. And I wish I could just cry over it all, but my body and brain and \"boys don't cry\" upbringing won't let me. \n\nI could really use a hug. \n\nI could really use someone on my side. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for your support, everyone. This is truly a great community. I think my own replies to people are held up in the moderation delay, so I'm editing here to express my gratitude. I love you all so much. ",

I thought everyone else was asleep but as I was going back to my room I hear my mom talking, which I thought was odd. I quickly realized she was talking about me and she was talking to my older sister. I’ve only exclusively have been with women but lately I’ve been exploring my attraction to men. My mother mentions “what the fuck is that, like this isn’t her, she has never liked men. it’s honestly disgusting.” “I don’t think she even realizes how much she is forcing me to accept this. I hate it. This has never been her and when we talk she thinks she so smart and knows more than us about sex and gender when she can’t even have kids.” It’s so crazy to hear that but also they still use my preferred pronouns, a win is a win I guess. My sister replied with “If my kid came out as trans or whatever the fuck I’m sending them straight to boarding school and having the bible shoved down their throat so they figure that shit out.” “I’m not gonna deal with that bullshit, I gave you your name, and I had the gender reveal. I don’t give a fuck about their feelings they need to learn the truth and realize who they are is the genitals they have.” My mom agreed but was like oh well Cam is an adult so nothing I can do. My sister has one kid and is pregnant again and I am honestly just baffled. They’ve been “supportive” but apparently this isn’t the real me and the “woke” lgbtq has changed me so now I am just apart of the hive mind. I am a little sad but at the same time knowing both of them are narcissists and have bpd I am not surprised that they only consider their feelings and not their children’s. Thanks for reading my rant, I’d appreciate comments if people have counter points to what they said for me to add on top of mine when I confront them. Consolation is also nice because I’m not sure how to proceed with my relationship with them going forward. ",

    "selftext": "It's been a while since I made a post on here! I made my reddit account so that I can use it as a way to document my transition experience to hopefully reach those that may feel like they are alone in their experience in hopes to make them not feel so alone! To preface I'm 32 years old and I've been medically and socially transitioning for 22 months! I've had vocal feminization surgery 10 months into my transition and breast augmentation 19 months into my transition! Both have changed my life so much for the better! But I digress. In the last few months I've come to realize something! I realized that I achieved something that I had thought would only occur in my dreams! Ive realized that by switching to geico I saved 10% or more on my car insurance! Haha just kidding! I feel like that I'm finally at the point in my transition that no matter how I dress or look, whether I wear a full face of makeup or not, nobody questions my gender and automatically assumes that I'm a girl! I've had guys publicly hit on me...like to me it's so mind blowing! I just had a really awkward experience trying to get my name changed with the VA since my military profile was still under my deadname...the poor guy was so confused because he had initially thought that I was a spouse trying to change my name...the puzzled  look he had on his face when he saw my old military ID photo on his computer was definitely a Kodiak moment! This experience alone forced me to realize that I've achieved something that I had only ever dreamed about since I was 12 years old...I'm a fucking girl and because sees me as such! \n\nGiven the time frame of my transition and how i pretty much speed ran through my medical transition (though I am still waiting for my bottom surgery 😵‍💫) I had the unique privilege of quickly assimilating amoungst cis women within my community quickly enough where I still very much remember how members of my society use to interact with on a day to day basis as a guy, and so I am able to compare that to how members of society treats me now as a woman rather than a man! Short note, men are treated like shit but have unrealized privilege! For example, when people see me struggling with stuff because my hands are so full people watch instead of help [as a guy], but the moment a person sees me struggle with anything today as a woman, without hesitation I get help! People could give 2 shits about opening doors for me before, in fact it was expected that if was to go out of my way to open doors for other people! However today people [mostly men] literally goes out of their way to open doors for me and to ensure that I enter the building first! In fact there was a gentleman that was literally halfway walking through a door to a store and he walked out so that I may enter the building first before him...a very sweet gesture but in my head it was very silly and awkward to watch! In general, as a woman, I get treated so much better! \n\nNot only have I started to experience the wonderful side of society as a woman, but I've also started experiencing the scary side of society where I quickly realized that the male privilege that I so took advantaged of as a guy was no longer there for me! I can not longer walk around at night without at least another trusted person beside me! I get super scared of men approaching me in parking lots [in fact I know that men knows not to do this because I've had men trying to be as cautious as possible as not to make me feel scared or uneasy when they are approaching me]! It's just so wild having experienced society on both ends of the binary gender spectrum! It made me realize that the trans community is the ONLY community that will ever get to experience this first hand! \n\nAfter reflecting for sometime, I know now that  transitioning was the greatest decision of my life and I have never felt so at ease with my own identity! But I'm also privileged enough to have the level of medical access that I do and the genetic position to have dramatic changes to my body and mind just from taking estrogen! I started my transition with no hope of being the person that I am today! So a message to all my transition brothers and sisters hesitant to start because you're afraid of it not working...shoot your shot anyways, here's your sign! Thanks for reading! ",

Spent most of her life on some combination of drugs in an effort to treat a medley of mental issues like ADHD, bipolar, dyslexia, and others. I don't begrudge her or anyone for using them. But like many such stories of people who don't get the support they need when using them, they ended up doing her in. It's how I learned she made me her emergency contact. I got the call and told our mom. \n\nNow, in some ways, I regret doing that. Because my dad, her stepdad, is insisting on holding a catholic funeral for whoever he thought she was. She was very pointedly not catholic, and she was very adamantly Stefny, even in her last days\n\nMy mom disagrees with this, and I'm grateful for this small solace. She's gonna hold a private service with a local funeral home in remembrance of her daughter, not my dad's step-son.\n\nBut still, I want to take the nuclear option. I want to go up to the podium and call out all these jerks who will show up with their two-faced crocodile tears, their fake-ass grief for a \"man\" they never gave a shit about when she was alive. How repugnant it is, to hijack a woman's death for the sake of assuaging their own religious guilt complexes. I want them all to look in their disgusting hearts and find only the ugliness they espouse as virtue, incapable of seeing how vile it is they're doing this in \"honor\" of her in death when they were incapable of respecting her in life\n\nIt makes me sick\n\nIt makes me furious\n\nIt makes me want to blow up in everyone's face from the indignation\n\nBut\n\nI can't\n\nIf anyone else had asked me to stop, I wouldn't. But I will for my mom, who this is hitting harder than anyone for reasons different than mine. She lost her daughter. And while I lost my sister, I openly admit to not liking her as a person, and my grief is a mix of sadness, confusion, and rage at how inhumanely they are treating my sister, while hers is that of pure loss\n\nBut here I sit, unsure of what to do with this white-hot coal burning in me\n\nIt isn't right, it isn't fair, even with the second funeral behind my dad and his family's backs. My sister shouldn't have to go through with this disrespect in the first place\n\nBut I don't want to put my mom through any more pain than she's already going through\n\nI just needed to get this out there",

I'm so pissed off at this concept that Cass has put forward, what the fuck is in it for a doctor to tell a kid \"oh yeah you're trans\". And of course they had to pull out the Autism statistics. Being trans is hard enough without all the hate and yet people just don't understand us. It's so damn clear that this shift is going to further demonise us, and probably even allow for Conversion Therapy to \"snap us out of it\". The NHS is now prohibited from allowing kids to gain access to any kind of gender affirming care and I'm sure that adults are next. I'm considering going underground to stop the issue before it starts. If being outwardly expressive in anyway is gonna get me hate I'm not putting up with it. Good luck and stay safe out there my fellow shapeshifters.

    "selftext": "So to start off, I’m an EMT first responder 22 yrs old. I work for a private EMS company and everyone knows I’m trans. I’m very passing with my appearance and voice and supported by everyone within the company.\n\nToday I got paired up with a new partner, male 34 yrs old, 2 kids, not married, and had been with the company for about 2 weeks. Upon meeting him, he was very sweet and kind, we vibed together and is what I consider my ideal partner to work with. From the start he thought I was a cis woman and I usually don’t tell people I’m trans until I get comfortable with them and feel out their personality.\n\nThe shift was going great! We worked well together on our calls, he was referring to me as She/her and even calling me ma’am or mama(Spanish cultural thing) throughout the day. Once we got more comfortable with each other we started to share about our lives and he mentioned how he has 2 gay brothers and that they came out to him first and he would do anything protect them from homophobic ppl. It was very sweet and heart warming to hear, simply made me happy. \n\nHe then mentioned how one of his gay brothers got a BBL, had lip fillers, and dresses in the most revealing/feminine things. I proceeded to ask him “Do you think your brother may ever transition?” \n\nHis response “Tbh if they ever decided to transition I’d tell them not to. I mean no disrespect but this is my opinion. I think trans people are mentally ill. At the end of the day they will always be men, and have XY chromosomes. Notice how most of psychiatric patients we have are transitioning, depressed, and suicidal. Especially with the hormones they be taking. They will never be woman.”\n\nYou’d think I’d be upset but honestly I was  more entertained with his opinions. Especially with the fact that he’s telling me these transphobic things and has no idea he’s sitting right beside a trans woman. I don’t make any big deal of it, and continued with our shift curious to know how this plays along. \n\nThroughout the rest of the shift, I noticed he was flirting with me in small ways doing things such as a squeezing my arm or touching me in certain places, but not in an uncomfortable way, and making sexual jokes. Even telling me how he likes Gothic/edgy women(I’m pretty edgy myself) and making it very subtle that he finds me attractive.\n\nOne issue I have at my company as an EMT is that my legal dead name is still on the system we use and for documentation purposes. Towards the end of our shift, he proceeded to ask me “question, what’s you name btw. I noticed in the system, and some people referring to you as (deadname)” \n\nI was very tempted to tell him I was trans and see the surprise on his face. I wasn’t scared or intimidated for my safety, but I just couldn’t for some reason and ended up making a lie. I told him that “My parents wanted a boy and wanted to name me (deadname). After finding out I was a girl they decided to keep (deadname). I don’t like the name and chose Vanessa for myself and usually introduce myself as Vanessa and ask ppl to refer to me as that.\nHe believed the lie that I said, and we ended our shift on a good note. \n\nI wasn’t nearly as bothered or as upset as you think I would be. I understood that people like this exist, and I can’t blame them for their opinions, especially with how the world is deeply uneducated when it comes to the trans community. \n\nOverall, I think he was a great partner to work with regardless of what he said. Perhaps I may tell him I am trans in the future with hopes to change his view on trans people. But I had a great shift and it was very entertaining given the scenario and how men act overall with women they find an attraction to. \n\nA funny and interesting experience I wanted to share with you guys. Much love and stay beautiful y’all 🫶🌈🖤\n",

He will blatantly stare into my windows if I dare to open my blinds and has made hard eye contact with me as he does. :/ Today, he loudly shouted \"transexual\" as I was approaching/trying to unlock my door. It sounded like he said it as part of a conversation with someone else, but the only word I caught was that one because he *really* shouted it. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of catching my attention, so I didn't look at him when he did it. \n\nPart of me wants to hang a bigass pride flag in my window out of spite, but I'm a 120lb transmasc who lives alone, and I just feel too vulnerable for that kind of flex right now. I don't want to let this one asshole get to me, but he's made me feel less safe in my own home. I already ordered a window camera that should be delivered this weekend. Is there anything else I can do?",

She was using the wrong pronouns all the time (in my language almost every word is gendered) which was weird bc she never acted that way. I said that ive been thinking about going to sexuologist to get a diagnosis. She said that its a bad idea cuz \"90% of trans people eventually accept their bodies (my body isnt the only problem, which she seemed to not understand) and that all of her trans patients eventually turned out to not be trans\" (ofc if you keep telling them that they are not trans they will just fold under pressure, duh...). I also told her that i talked about it with my parents but they are busy and forgot to set up an appointment with the sexuologist, and as an answer she told me that theyre just dont want me to \"ruin my body forever\" and that they wanna \"protect me from hurting myself\". She told me that im prolly just a gay man, which really threw me off guard cuz im yet to be romantically attracted to a cis guy.\n\nShe also pulled the usual bigot bs type \"sui rates skyrocket in ppl who transitioned\", \"hrt makes you unable to orgasm\" etc.\n\nI also got asked a bunch of pretty private questions regarding my sex life (mind you im underage) and idk maybe its normal for psychiatrists to ask theese questions i was just a lil suprised.\n\nShe was also rude to my dad. I really dont like her bc she acts like a totally diffrent person everytime i see her and its creeping me out.",

Been dealing with chronic pain for a while but last night I collapsed on the floor and was unable to stand up, my legs didn't have the strength and my knees kept buckling. Went to the ER, first question before asking about any of my medical history was if my HRT was being managed correctly. I tried explaining my medical history and that I could ambulate fine less than a few hours ago, but my transition kept coming back up. I told several doctors and nurses that my transition is going great and my hormones are at normal levels for a cis male, and also testosterone builds muscle?? I've been on it for almost a year and a half, if that was a side effect I would have felt it a lot sooner. Also, why would it do the exact opposite extremely suddenly?? They just told me that I'm not actively bleeding out and dying, so they gave me a steroid shot and discharged me after I begged to stay and get more testing done. Tried sleeping it off and hoping they would kick in by the morning but nope, still can't walk. Having one of my roommates drive me to a different hospital an hour away in the morning. \nAnyways TLDR hospitals please get some sensitivity training, vent over hopefully I don't become paralyzed\n\nUPDATE: At a different hospital now, getting blood work and waiting for an MRI. I will be getting a lawyer as well after this visit so I can go back there and tell them that I actually had a very serious health condition and their negligence delayed me getting treatment\n\nLAST UPDATE: other hospital had no idea why I couldnt' stand, MRI came back with nothing and nothing on my bloodwork suggesting why. I did however have a blood glucose level of 284, so following up with my primary to investigate possible type 1 diabetes and also looking for a wheelchair or rollator to borrow until my legs decide to start working agian. Also lawering up, my work has an employee assistance program and I can get a free consultation. I want that hospital to foot the bill plus extra for making me have a panic attack and delaying me getting actual treatment",
