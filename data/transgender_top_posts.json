Rowling's continued anti-transgender comments, as well as her support for others with transphobic views.”\n\n“The actor, who earned a Tony Award nomination on April 30, said in a new interview with The Atlantic that he hasn't spoken to Rowling, 58, in years. Radcliffe starred as the titular hero in all eight Potter films, based on her bestselling novels, from 2001 to 2011.”\n\n\"It makes me really sad, ultimately, because I do look at the person that I met, the times that we met, and the books that she wrote and the world that she created, and all of that is to me so deeply empathic,\" Radcliffe said of Rowling and her controversial comments about gender.”\n\n\"Jo, obviously Harry Potter would not have happened without her, so nothing in my life would have probably happened the way it is without that person,\" he added. \"But that doesn’t mean that you owe the things you truly believe to someone else for your entire life.\"\n\n“Radcliffe also responded to Rowling recently writing on social media that he and his costars Emma Watson and Rupert Grint can \"save their apologies\" and she wouldn't forgive them for their differing points of view. Radcliffe told the outlet: \"I will continue to support the rights of all LGBTQ people, and have no further comment than that.\"\n\n“Radcliffe was among the first Potter cast members to speak out against Rowling's anti-transgender remarks back in June 2020.”\n\n“At the time, Radcliffe wrote in an essay for the Trevor Project that \"transgender women are women.\"",

    "selftext": "Putting a separate post here as much of the reporting on Tickle v Giggle has brushed what the case actually means.\n\nThe Federal court of Australia, building on previous cases like Re Kevin, has ruled that sex is not immutable and is changed when a person transitions.\n\nBut simply, trans women are not - according to the laws of Australia - “biological males who identify as women” the way TERFs claim. They are women.\n\nTo quote the court, “…the sex of a person may take into account a range of factors, including biological and physical characteristics, legal recognition and how they present themselves and are recognised socially.”\n\nIn addition to making it illegal for women-only social media sites like Giggle to exclude trans women, the decision rejects UK jurisprudence and may open the possibility for trans women to sue people who describe them as men for slander or defamation of character.\n\nConsistent with the Re Kevin decision many years ago, this makes clear that trans women who live as women (based on a majority of factors) are women and are female under the law.\n\nIt means that discrimination that separates out trans women from cisgender women for unequal treatment is clearly in breach of anti discrimination laws, reinforcing practices and attitudes that are far more progressive than what is found in the UK or US “red states”.\n\nThe ruling from the Federal Court applies to all Australian states and ends a painful period of uncertainty during which we were not sure if completely opposite jurisprudence from the USA or UK would ruin our lives.\n",

It was also meant to push Democrats to abandon what Willis describes as \"a pattern of ignoring and sidelining the trans community\" in the face of escalating conservative attacks.”\n\n“Just hours after Willis’s interview with The Independent, House and Senate negotiators revealed a bipartisan compromise spending bill that would ban military health insurance from covering transition care for children. On Wednesday, 50 House Democrats who previously denounced that provision voted in favor, and key Senate Democrats said they would reluctantly back it too.”\n\n“Now, with Republicans taking control of all three branches of government and both houses of Congress in January, Willis is gearing up for a fight – and she does not believe trans people can afford to take their cues from Democrats.”\n\n\"We have to be prepared to take care of ourselves, and speak for ourselves, and fight for ourselves, because there are not enough political leaders who are sticking up for us,” she says.”\n",

It did, however, reduce public acceptance of trans people across nearly all demographics. \n\n\"An ad campaign launched this year by Ground Media in partnership with GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy group, advocates for broad support for transgender Americans and their families.\"\n\n\"Transgender issues are among the least important issues driving voters to the ballot box, a recent Gallup poll found, and a similar focus on transgender athletes and health care in 2022 failed to translate to election wins for Republicans.\"",

That could even end up including classics such as Ovid's ‘Metamorphoses,’ Virginia Woolf's ‘Orlando’ or Armistead Maupin's ‘Tales of the City.’”\n\n“Unlike other, more detailed proposals in Project 2025, it's unclear exactly how this would be put into place.”\n\n“Perhaps, as with Trump's 2016 pledge [signing a pledge to crack down on porn], the vague proposal to ban porn may go nowhere in a second term.

    "selftext": "“Hundreds of thousands of transgender people could lose access to medical treatment or be forced to detransition under a little-known Republican effort to defund trans healthcare for both adults and children.\n\n“Since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives last January, GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill have quietly added a wave of amendments to ‘must-pass’ government funding bills that would ban federal money from being used for gender transition procedures such as hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery.\n\n“These riders vary widely in their scope and effect. Some target government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Others would revoke insurance coverage for transgender government employees. Still others would bar federal funding for any institution that ‘promotes transgenderism’.\n\n“Taken together, though, they would drastically curtail trans people’s access to medical care that advocates routinely describe as critical to their flourishing – much as the 1977 Hyde Amendment restricted abortion access in the wake of Roe v Wade.”\n\n“Last year seven out of 12 appropriations bills were amended in the House to restrict trans healthcare. . . .”\n\n“This year similar riders were stealthily attached to bills appropriating funds for the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Defence (DoD), and HHS.”\n\n“That last bill is particularly important because it funds Medicare, which provides health insurance to around 65m older and disabled people, and Medicaid, which does the same for roughly 85m on low incomes.\n\n“In June, House Republicans amended this year’s iteration of the annual National Defence Authorization Act (NDAA) to revoke coverage for trans healthcare under the Pentagon’s sprawling Tricare health insurance program, which serves around 9.6m current and former service members and dependents.”\n\n“These bills aren’t happening in isolation. In addition to the GOP’s broad-spectrum war against trans rights and healthcare, the Heritage Foundation – an influential hyperconservative think tank – has proposed sweeping efforts to push trans people out of public life as part of its ambitious ‘Project 2025’ manifesto.\n\n“Hence, if next year’s session of Congress opens with Republicans in control of all three branches of government, both [ACLU communications strategist Gillian]  Branstetter and [director of UC San Francisco’s gender psychiatry program Jack] Turban fear that withholding taxpayer dollars will only be the beginning.”\n",

'For example, if they have my name as a complainant, you know, I’m not complaining.'\n\nHis office created an online reporting tool to comply with Morgan Republican Rep. Kera Birkeland’s 'Sex-based Designations for Privacy, Anti-bullying and Women’s Opportunities,' or HB257.\n\n\"After being rushed through the Legislature and quickly signed by Gov. Spencer Cox in January, the now-law changes the legal definitions of 'female' and 'male' to categorize Utahns by the reproductive organs of their birth, and restricts which bathrooms and locker rooms trans people can use in government-owned buildings.\n\n\"The law goes on to require the state auditor’s office to 'establish a process to receive and investigate alleged violations of this chapter by a government entity,' and then notify that entity. If the violation isn’t resolved, the auditor is required to refer the issue to the Utah attorney general’s office, which can then impose fines up to $10,000 'per violation per day.'\n\n“'I would assume the Legislature probably didn’t think through what kind of public backlash might happen,' Dougall said Friday.\"",

It alleges that she was fired last year from her job on Liberty’s Information Technology help desk solely because of her gender identity, in violation of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964.”\n\n“Zinski, 30, says she was raised as a conservative Christian, attended a Christian high school, and took the job at Liberty hoping the university — which she had admired — would accept her even after learning of her transition. She had received a positive performance review after completing her probation.\n\n“’I was really hoping they would work with me ... that I could be myself,’ she told The Associated Press. ‘I was hoping I could advocate for queer people. We need Jesus just as much as anyone else does.’”\n\n“Within a few months of her firing, Zinski was able to obtain a similar IT help-desk job at the University of Lynchburg, a small, private university. It is affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination, and describes spiritual life on campus as ‘inclusive and open.’”\n\n“The next formal step in the case will be the filing of a brief by the ACLU of Virginia opposing Liberty Counsel’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.”\n",

The employee reported the supervisor’s conduct to the hotel’s front office and general managers, who said they would speak to the supervisor.\n\n“EEOC claimed the employee was told by hotel management the next day that the supervisor denied the alleged conduct and ‘needed more time to get used to’ working with a transgender co-worker. When the employee suggested a meeting to discuss the subject, management declined, and the general manager told the employee that the job ‘may not be a good fit’for the plaintiff and told them their services ‘were no longer needed,’ EEOC said.”\n\n“’Preventing and remedying discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals remain key priorities for the EEOC,’ said Kimberly Cruz, regional attorney for the EEOC’s New York District Office, said in an agency press release. ’Enduring harassment based on one’s transgender status is not and should not be a condition of employment.’”\n\n“This year also marked EEOC’s publication of the agency’s finalized harassment enforcement guidance, which was updated to incorporate the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 decision establishing that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity constitutes sex-based discrimination under Title VII. The guidance, which has been challenged by several state governments and religious entities, identified misgendering and similar conduct as examples of illegal harassment.”\n",

    "selftext": "“Former President Trump and Republican congressional candidates have blanketed the nation with campaign ads critical of transgender rights, painting their Democratic opponents as radical for supporting trans-inclusive policies.”\n\n“Splashed across those and other ads are the faces of transgender women, girls and drag performers, often without their prior knowledge or consent.\n\n“Gabrielle Ludwig, a biomedical equipment technician in her early 60s, is one of those women.”\n\n“The ads, which show Ludwig playing on the community college’s women’s basketball team, criticize the three Democrats for opposing an amendment to a 2021 COVID-19 relief bill that would have stripped federal funds from states, school districts and universities that allow transgender women and girls to compete on female sports teams.”\n\n“The ads weigh heavily on Ludwig, who has not played basketball competitively in a decade. \n\n“’I haven’t been able to sleep,’ she said in an interview. ‘I don’t want my family affected. I have granddaughters, daughters who are in college. I only did this because I love to play basketball. That’s all it ever was.’”\n\n“The ads, she said, have thrust her back into an unwanted spotlight. Comments left on her Facebook page disparage and threaten her, and a fear that she is being watched sets in when she leaves the house. Her employer is avoiding sending her to Ohio, where she travels at least twice a year for work, because of the ads. \n\n“’I fear for my life, for my family,’ Ludwig said. ‘There are trans people killed for no other reason than because they’re trans. By Trump coming out and using my image, I feel that he’s feeding the fire.’”\n\n\"Historically, the strongest and most successful arguments against the unauthorized use of images for political purposes are copyright claims, said Cathay Smith, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law and co-director of the school’s intellectual property law program. But that requires ownership of the copyright, she said, meaning the photographer must be the one to file the claim, or transfer the copyright to someone else.\"\n\n\"Political speech, which includes campaign ads, receives the greatest protection under the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. The Federal Trade Commission, tasked with protecting consumers from false advertising, can do little to intervene in political advertising that misleads audiences or includes false information.\"\n",

That backlash took off this week after a video surfaced from a family’s trip to the Story Book Dining at Artist Point at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge within Walt Disney World Resort.\"\n\n\"This story took on a new dimension yesterday when a father from a 'conservative Christian family,' demanded to know the biological sex of the person playing the Evil Queen from the manager at Story Book Dining.\"\n\n\"The man and his family were having dinner, and when it came time to meet the Evil Queen, the father told the waiter that he believed it was a 'drag queen' playing the character. He informed the waiter that he had spent a lot of money on his Disney World vacation this year and had spent tens of thousands of dollars over the years.\n\n\"He also told the waiter that it showed a lack of respect because having someone play a role whose gender identity did not match the character was against his 'family values,' and he did not want his child to be a part of that.\n\n\"He asked to speak with the manager, who assured the father that a woman was playing the role and that she had been 'so excited' to get the role of the Evil Queen.\n\n\"However, that did not satisfy him, and he asked if it was a 'biological male,' and the manager responded that she “could not answer that.'\n\n\"Despite the family’s outrage, most of the reaction on social media was positive. Several former cast members pointed out that most of the characters in costumes were played by women, including males.\"",

In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism and misogyny have diminished. To paraphrase a civil-rights advocate from an earlier time, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”\n\n“In the meantime, the federal courts have a role to play in upholding the Constitution and laws. The State of Florida can regulate as needed but cannot flatly deny transgender individuals safe and effective medical treatment — treatment with medications routinely provided to others with the state’s full approval so long as the purpose is not to support the patient’s transgender identity.”\n\n“Hinkle also asserted, “Gender identity is real.”\n\n“He had temporarily blocked the law last year.

Ron DeSantis for spreading lies about trans care for young people.”\n\nJudge Hinkle’s rightful ruling declaring the ban unconstitutional:\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.460963/gov.uscourts.flnd.460963.223.0.pd",

I’m tired of pretending to be a man,’ she said.\n\n“She also remains vocal about the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in present-day Russia, saying their rights are discriminated against and violated. ‘I hope my post will provide moral support to transgender people,’ she said adding that it is currently impossible for a transgender person to change the documents even after an official medical diagnosis confirming their gender identity.”\n\n“When asked what Alyoshina was hoping to achieve for other transgender people in Russia by coming forward with this statement, she replied: ‘I would like to convey the message: Don’t give up, keep fighting.

Skrmetti asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution, a question the Court has never answered.\n\n“A decision against the trans plaintiffs in Skrmetti, moreover, could potentially upend the entire legal framework protecting Americans from gender discrimination of all kinds.”\n\n“[T]here are two reasons to be pessimistic about Skrmetti. One is that after the recent election, anti-trans voices within the Court are likely to be emboldened, and pro-trans voices may feel like they have limited political capital. The other is that, while Tennessee’s law clearly discriminates on the basis of sex, the Court has only held that laws that do so should be presumed to be unconstitutional unless — as the Court put it in [United States v. Virginia (1996)] — there’s an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for the law.\n\n“It is possible that this Court will hold that a ban on trans health care meets this bar.”\n\n“Given the Court’s decisions in [Craig v. Boren (1976)], and Virginia, it should be obvious that Tennessee’s law draws distinctions based on sex and thus can only survive if the state can offer an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for it. Indeed, if the Court were to reject that conclusion, it would do considerable violence to the legal principles governing all gender discrimination cases.”\n\n“[I]t is exceedingly likely that the Trump administration will reverse the Justice Department’s position on this case once it takes power in January and formally withdraw its request for the justices to hear this case [leaving a private plaintiffs’ petition against the law, L.W. v. Skrmetti]. That means that if the justices want to hold on to the case past January, they will need to grant the L.W. Petition.\n\n“Realistically, none of these procedural maneuvers are likely to change much. It’s possible that the Court will delay oral arguments until all of this is resolved. But, if the justices want to resolve the issue presented by Skrmetti, there’s no reason why the Court can’t decide this case in its current term (which means a decision is likely in late June), regardless of how the procedural drama shakes out.”\n",

Boos could also be heard as the teenage runner received her gold medal at the University of Oregon’s Hayward Field in Eugene, the videos show.\n\n\"Gallagher’s win quickly went viral on social media, with some critics characterizing her participation in the girls’ division as unfair, arguing that those assigned male at birth are inherently stronger and faster than those assigned female at birth. Others hurled transphobic insults at the high schooler.\"\n\n\"The backlash following Gallagher’s win is the latest flashpoint in a yearslong and divisive debate over whether trans athletes, and particularly trans girls and women, should be allowed to participate in sporting events that match their gender identities. \n\n\"A majority of Americans, 69%, say that trans athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth, according to a 2023 Gallup poll of roughly 1,000 adults living in the United States.\"\n\n\"Cyd Zeigler, the founder of LGBTQ sports site Outsports and a longtime LGBTQ advocate, condemned the backlash against Gallagher’s win.\n\n“'For conservatives to attack her as a \"cheater\" and saying she couldn’t make it as a boy so now she’s a girl, it’s just disgusting,' Zeigler said in an interview.

The policy, school officials said, is intended ‘to provide support to students who express concern about their gender identity.’\n\n“‘The issue in the Wisconsin case is less about the underlying question of parental rights, and more about what plaintiffs have to show before they’re allowed to challenge government actions that may not have happened and may not ever happen,’ said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.”\n\n“Similar cases have made their way to the Supreme Court before. The justices in May denied an appeal from a group of parents in suburban Washington who made the same argument.

The group over-enunciates one bully’s name, joking he should be exposed. But they also express empathy for their tormentors – some later came out as queer and trans themselves. They direct more of their ire at the adults in their school system, who made Grimm’s life a living hell.”\n\n“In 2014, the Gloucester county school board voted to ban Grimm, then 15, from using the boys’ bathrooms, even though he’d been living openly as a boy for months and using the restroom without incident. The policy turned deeply intimate facts of Grimm’s life into a media spectacle. With the ACLU, he sued to defend his rights to use facilities that matched his gender, launching a groundbreaking national case on bathroom access. Grimm became an LGBTQ+ icon, celebrated by Laverne Cox at the Grammys and interviewed by Whoopi Goldberg on The View. He eventually won a landmark federal decision asserting trans youth’s constitutional protections against discrimination.\n\n\"Advocates hoped the victory would squash the conservative movement’s targeting of trans students. Instead, the climate for trans youth in the US has rapidly devolved as laws eroding their rights have been adopted in more than half of the country in recent years. Trans students have increasingly been banned from bathrooms and sports teams, barred from using their pronouns and names, and their existence has been ridiculed by Republican leaders and debated in news segments.\n\n“And while Grimm became a civil rights trailblazer, the case did not secure him stability or financial security. The Pride parade invites have stopped coming, and like so many other marginalized trans people, Grimm has faced significant mental health challenges and struggles with poverty. He recently lost his housing, and is now facing homelessness.\n\n“’I’m someone who has had worldwide visibility. I represent an outer crust of privilege most people will never see, and I cannot make ends meet no matter how hard I try,’ he says.”\n",

Women are not subject to criminal prosecution for obtaining abortions, but state law imposes penalties of as much as life in prison for those who aid in obtaining abortions.”\n\n“The lawsuit claims that the privacy rules ignore federal law that lets states view medical records ‘for law enforcement purposes.’\n\n“In a statement on Wednesday, Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, called the April rule ‘a backdoor attempt at weakening Texas’ laws.’ He added: ‘The Biden administration’s motive is clear: to subvert lawful state investigations on issues that the courts have said the states may investigate’”\n\n“The lawsuit filed on Wednesday also asserts that the rule covers ‘hormone and drug therapy for gender dysphoria, surgical procedures related to gender dysphoria, and gender experimentation.’ Texas bars minors from obtaining gender-transition surgery and related care like hormone therapy.\n\n“Whether Texas investigators have sought records of women who traveled out of state for abortions is unclear. But Mr. Paxton, a Republican, has demanded records on gender-transition care from organizations in Washington State and Georgia. In March, a judge temporarily blocked Mr. Paxton from forcing an L.G.B.T.Q. organization to turn over documents.\n\n“The Texas lawsuit could set off a protracted legal battle over both abortion and medical privacy rules. In June, the Supreme Court overturned decades of legal precedent that gave broad regulatory authority to federal agencies.\n\n“’Texas is arguing that the federal health agency doesn’t have the authority to determine what the scope of federal privacy is,’ said David Donatti, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which has been active in fighting the state’s restrictions on abortion.”\n",

The teen was eating while seated on the floor when Love allegedly stabbed the teen without provocation 18 times in the arms, shoulders, neck, face, head and legs with a butcher knife.”\n\n“The arrest affidavit states that when the victim tried to free herself from the attack, Love allegedly grabbed her and tried to pull and push her over the fourth floor railing where the victim would have landed on the first floor of the airport. The victim escaped and ran downstairs where she received medical assistance.”\n\n“Police officers took the subject into custody in the area where the stabbing occurred and recovered the knife.

But almost immediately, I was downvoted pretty heavily, which was disappointing. I know there’s a range of opinions, but I wasn’t expecting that reaction to something so simple and positive.\n\nIt made me think about how much progress we’ve made, but also how far we still have to go, even among fellow veterans. On that note, here’s something a lot of people don’t realize: the U.S. Department of Defense is actually the world’s largest employer of trans people. Despite the challenges we face, so many of us are proudly serving or have served, which I think is pretty amazing and worth acknowledging.\n\nI just wanted to share this experience and reminder that trans veterans are a bigger part of the military community than some might think. If you’re a trans vet too, just know you’re not alone – and Happy Veterans Day to all of us who served! 🫡",

He is afraid for her because he believes doing his job as a father — keeping his girl happy, healthy and safe — is going to become exeedingly difficult under the administraiton of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\n“His daughter ― a bright elementary school student, who likes riding her bike and playing with friends and hugs him every night when he returns home from work — is transgender. And Trump, who decisively won last week's election, has pledged to rescind protections for members of the LGBTQ+ community, especially those of transgender minors, adding fuel to what many believe is an already hateful environment.\n\n\"’It's my job to protect (my daughter) and now everything's so much more dangerous we don't know what's going to happen next,’ said the father, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears for his child's safety. ‘It's scary. It's terrifying.’\n\n“He added: ‘My daughter ... she's a regular kid. ... Her being trans is not the most interesting thing about her. ... It's just who she is and if not for the fact that half the country seems to think she's somehow a threat, I don't think we would even think about it that much.’”\n\n“The unnamed metro Detroit father of an elementary school trans child has done what he can to shield his daughter from hate. Father and daughter enjoy watching the Detroit Lions together, but to prevent his daughter from seeing the anti-trains commercials that played during football games, he recorded the games and watched on delay to fast forward through commercials.\n\n“Outside of immediate family, few know of his daughter's transgender status. To keep that circle small, the family moved to a new school district that seems trans friendly and where no one knew the girl. There, an administrator knows she is trans, but her teacher does not.”\n\n\"’She was a baby just like anybody else,’ the man said. ‘And we brought her home and we took care of her and she learned to walk and learned to talk and became this whole person. And just because she isn't exactly who we thought she was going to be doesn't mean her and that baby aren't still the same person. Where some people want you to see a threat, I just see my baby sleeping on me, my toddler setting up a birthday party for her stuffed animals, and my little kid going to her first day of school.

It focuses on one inmate, whom the ad does not name, who murdered a 33-year-old father of three in Los Angeles ‘during a drug- and alcohol-fueled rampage,’ as the Los Angeles Times put it in 2017. The ad ends with a female narrator saying: ‘Kamala’s agenda is they/them. Not you.’ Then comes Trump’s voice, affirming that he approved this message.\n\n“It’s certainly an attention-getter. And the Trump campaign must think it’s working for them, because the campaign has spent far more on that ad than any other. According to data compiled by AdImpact, in the last two weeks, team Trump has spent a little more than $17 million airing the ad. They’ve run it 24,000 times, and AdImpact estimates that it’s been seen nearly 550 million times. They’ve spent nearly $3 million running the ad in Pennsylvania, $2.4 million in North Carolina, $2.1 million in Georgia, and $1.7 million in Wisconsin. \n\n“There’s another ad on the same topic called ‘Access.’ The campaign has spent $12 million on it over the last 27 days. AdImpact estimates that this ad has been seen more than 400 million times over that time. And there are four more ads on the theme that add up to around $970,000. AdImpact says the Trump campaign’s total advertising spending comes to $66 million, so these six ads account for nearly half of that total. (Similar ads are running in Senate and other races, so the real total of Republican spending on this issue is far greater.)\n\n“Some Trump-affiliated PACs are spending a few million on border-related ads, but mostly, Trump is dumping his eggs into the anti-trans basket.”\n\n“So. Will it work? . . .it’s a twofer, combining two right-wing targets, and at heart it’s really an anti-trans ad. Murderers are a dime a dozen in this violent, gun-laden country. But a murderer who got a sex-reassignment operation, paid for by California taxpayers? That’s what the ad wants its viewers to be enraged about.”\n\n“[F]or most people, it’s just not a voting issue. So maybe these ads aren’t doing the damage the Trump people think they’re doing. Or maybe they do elicit a strong emotional response in the moment, but after people walk away from them, the message doesn’t stick with them, and it isn’t something they’re going to carry into the voting booth.”\n",

Sweet Briar’s leadership said the document requires it to ‘be a place of “girls and young women.”’\n\n“The phrase ‘must be interpreted as it was understood at the time the Will was written,’ Sweet Briar’s president and board chair wrote in a letter earlier this month to the college community.”\n\n“The new guidelines are facing criticism from some students and most faculty. They warn the politically fraught policy could repel potential students — not just transgender women — when women’s colleges have been closing, going co-ed or merging with other schools. Sweet Briar nearly shuttered in 2015.\n\n“Critics also question the board’s originalist interpretation of a will that explicitly excluded non-white students.”\n\n“John Gregory Brown, an English professor and faculty senate chair, said the reasoning for the transgender policy is ‘absurd.’\n\n“’Williams also wouldn’t have entertained the notion that somebody who was disabled would be a potential student,’ Brown added.\n\n“On Monday night, the faculty voted 48 to 4, with one abstention, to call on the board to rescind the policy, Brown said.\n\n“Sweet Briar has about 460 students — known as Vixens — and was established in 1901 on Williams’ estate, a former plantation in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.”\n\n“On Aug. 10, the Sweet Briar College Student Government Association stated the policy was ‘alienating, unnecessary, and it reflects the rise of transphobia in our country.’\n\n“Association President Isabella Paul, a senior who identifies as nonbinary, told the AP that at least 10% of students use different pronouns and wouldn’t fit in the policy’s description of women.\n\n“’And there are allies here who may identify as women but have friends and lovers and family members who are nonbinary, genderqueer and transgender,’ Paul said.”\n\n “Women’s colleges in the U.S. began to admit transgender women about 10 years ago, including Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and Spelman College, a historically Black school in Atlanta.”\n",

About one in four transgender students said they had attempted [killing themselves] in the past year, compared with 11 percent of cisgender girls and 5 percent of cisgender boys.\n\n“’We have 5 percent of young people in the country who, because of the way they identify around their gender, are stigmatized, bullied, made to feel unsafe, feel disconnected at school and consequently have poorer mental health and higher risk for [self harm] than their cisgender peers,’ said Kathleen Ethier, the director of C.D.C.’s adolescent and school health division.‘That’s just heartbreaking.’\n\n“The data come from the agency’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, a survey of more than 20,000 high school students conducted in public and private schools across the country every two years. The 2023 survey was the first to ask teenagers in all schools whether they identified as transgender.”\n\n“A 2022 report by the Williams Institute, an L.G.B.T.Q. public-policy research center at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimated that 1.4 percent of teenagers identified as transgender. But that figure was based on C.D.C. data collected from just 15 states in 2017 and 2019; researchers used statistical modeling to then extrapolate a national number.\n\n“”Data like this is exceedingly rare,’ said Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute and an author of the 2022 report. ‘It certainly fills in significant gaps in our knowledge about trans youth.’\n\n“Dr. Herman said the data seemed to align with trends the institute had seen in its own data: More young people identified as transgender than adults did, and that number grew over time. But she cautioned against drawing direct comparisons with her group’s prior estimates.\n\n“’If the age trend holds, we would imagine as time goes on, that younger age group might have more youth identifying as trans,’ she said. But that idea cannot be confirmed until the next batch of data from the C.D.C.’s survey, she said: ‘That is the gold standard for looking at something like that.’”\n",

The incumbent, Scott Martin, is vocally anti-abortion and the sponsor of a bill banning instruction around gender identity and sexual orientation in elementary schools.”\n\n“But Proffitt, a 56-year-old history teacher at a small Quaker school, still felt something could be done. He decided to run against Martin, winning a write-in campaign to become the Democratic nominee for state senate. After a personal tragedy, Proffitt wanted to center LGBTQ rights in his campaign—even in a reliably Republican district.\n\n“In 2019, Proffitt’s son George, who was transgender, died at the age of 20 from a drug overdose. George loved folk punk music and was active in the local LGBTQ community. He had struggled for years with depression and suicidality, but he seemed to be doing better before his death.\n\n“In the years since, Proffitt has watched anti-transgender rhetoric become increasingly visible in his community, as a national backlash towards trans people amplified and enabled sentiment that was already ‘endemic’ to Lancaster, he said. As my colleague Kiera Butler has reported, Lancaster County is home to a burgeoning Christian nationalist movement.”\n\n“It was in the wake of the [self-killing] of another trans young person in the area, that he saw no one running against Martin. At the time, he told me, the death left him ‘looking for something more to do in my life.’\n\n“Since then, he has campaigned fiercely on transgender rights, an unusual pitch against a conservative incumbent. But, Proffitt hopes, it will show Democrats they do not have to back away from talking about people like his son.\n\n“Transgender rights remain a ‘third rail’ in politics, he told me. ‘Don’t talk about it. Everybody just—wink wink—somehow knows you’re pro-LGBT+,’ Proffitt said. ‘I don’t think that’s working.’”\n",

All of them became law.”\n\n“Those laws supported by State Rep. Shawn Thierry “put a target on some families that are already extremely vulnerable and dealing with so much, living in a state like Texas,” Simmons tells The Independent.’\n\n“To know that this Democrat representative for a big blue district in a pretty blue city turned her back – that betrayed and hurt me,” she says. “But then knowing that people had to leave the state, it really sent me over the edge.”\n\n“So Simmons ran against her.”\n\n“On May 28, Simmons defeated Thierry in a Democratic primary election with 65 percent of the vote. Now the progressive candidate is widely expected to win in the mostly non white and heavily Democratic-leaning district in November’s general election.”\n\n“Simmons will join an incoming class of other recently elected LGBT+ lawmakers preparing for a GOP-dominated body that routinely legislates against them and their families.”\n\n“Texas Republicans outlawed gender-affirming healthcare for transgender teens, blocked trans college athletes from playing on teams that don’t align with their gender, and banned broadly defined “sexually explicit” books from school libraries.”\n\n“Thierry voted for all three.”\n\n“Supporters encouraged her [Simmons] to run after her viral opposition to Republican threats to public education, but Thierry’s vote to deny affirming healthcare to young trans people was something of a last straw.”",

It added that [it] used other ways to confirm the posts came from him, including that he posted to the forum that he was in Greensboro, which is where he lives.”\n\n“Robinson, who’s North Carolina’s current lieutenant governor, had been running as a staunch conservative alternative to North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, the Democrat’s nominee. He has a recent history of anti-transgender rhetoric, but he had a starkly different tone when he wrote in online forums.”\n\n“The Carolina Journal reported that ‘members of the Trump campaign’ have asked Robinson to withdrawal from the race over the article’s explicit nature.

She is running against Elias Haynes, who came on the board in December 2022.”\n\n“Simpson became involved in Gateway school district politics in early 2023 after Elias and Lindsi Haynes, a married couple, were seated on the board in December 2022. Soon after being sworn into office, the two joined with Cherrill Clifford in a vote to fire district Superintendent Jim Harrell.”\n\n“Simpson spoke at several board meetings at the time and helped out with the attempt to recall the Hayneses, which ultimately was unsuccessful. Unable to get either of the Hayneses recalled or to resign, Simpson said she decided to run for the position.\n\n“Simpson said she ran for a seat on the board to diversify the representation on the board.\n\n\"’I do think that it is good to have the representation of different viewpoints, because they did push for it. They're calling it parental rights, but it's a forced outing policy, and I'm definitely against that,’ she said.”\n\n“In response to those policies, the California Legislature passed AB 1955, which prohibits public schools from forcing an educator or other school staff to disclose a student's change in sexual orientation or gender preference without the students' consent.\"",

Tim Walz would be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election electrified Democrats and their allies across the country.”\n\n“Trans issues have emerged as one of the primary political targets of the Republican Party, and many of the party’s legislative accomplishments over the last few years involve the systematic persecution of trans people’s rights in red-state legislatures. Because of that, Harris needed to choose someone with a track record of handling the inevitable gender identity attacks. Enter Walz.\n\n“First and foremost, Walz was the creator of the 'weird' attack line that has knocked Republicans on their heels over the last month of the campaign. Branding Republicans and their gender-based obsessions with pregnancy and trans people as creepy and ’weird’ brilliantly defuses the emotional manipulation conservatives are trying to achieve. It is, indeed, weird to be worried about children’s genitals, it is weird to obsess over Olympic athlete’s chromosomes, it is weird to criticize women for being childless (but never childless men).”\n\n“Outside of his official record on queer and trans issues, I’m struck by how he talks about the trans people in his state. In a time when a lot of national level Democrats are afraid to even say the word ‘ trans’ or who speak in euphemisms with vague references to allowing people ‘to be who they are,’ Walz positions his support for trans issues as a matter of being neighborly.\n\n“’We are saying to our trans loved ones, friends, neighbors, and fellow Minnesotans: you belong here,’ he said in a statement after signing the aforementioned executive order. ‘You are safe here, and we want you in our community as your authentic selves.’\n\n\"It’s clear that he treats LGBTQ people with respect and dignity, worrying more about their well-being than political optics.\"\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "\"The Supreme Court on Friday rejected the Biden administration’s request to be allowed to temporarily enforce most of an April 2024 rule implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding, while its appeals continued.\n\n\"Friday’s ruling leaves in place for now decisions by federal appeals courts that barred the Biden administration from enforcing any portion of the rule, including three provisions that target discrimination against transgender people in schools. The Biden administration had not asked the Supreme Court to intervene with regard to two of those provisions.\n\nThe justices divided 5-4 on whether to temporarily bar the government from enforcing the entire rule. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They called the lower courts’ orders 'overbroad.'\n\n\"The orders came in two separate challenges – one filed in Kentucky by six states and one in Louisiana by four states. Both challenges focused on three provisions of the April 2024 rule that target discrimination against transgender people. The first provision recognizes that Title IX’s ban on sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity. A second provision at issue in the case makes clear that schools violate Title IX when they bar transgender people from using bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity. And a third provision defines 'hostile-environment harassment' to include harassment based on gender identity, which the states say could require students and teachers to refer to transgender students by the pronouns that correspond to their gender identity.\"\n\n\"In a three-page unsigned opinion issued on Friday afternoon, the court turned down the Biden administration’s request to be allowed to implement most of the rule. The justices first explained that they all agreed that the three provisions should remain on hold for now, 'including the central provision that newly defines sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.'\n\n\"Turning to the rest of the rule, the justices noted that the government can only prevail if it can show that it is likely to succeed on its argument that the three provisions can be separated from the rest of the rule and that fairness warrants a stay. But thus far, with a 'limited record' and 'in its emergency applications,' the justices concluded, the government has not given the court 'a sufficient basis to disturb the lower courts’ interim conclusions that the three provisions likely to be unlawful are intertwined with and affect other provisions of the rule.'\"",

But both received written warnings from the university in March that doing so violated a policy adopted in December by the South Dakota Board of Regents.\n\n“'I was told that I had 5 days to remove my tribal affiliation and pronouns,' Little said in an email to The Associated Press. 'I believe the exact wording was that I had \"5 days to correct the behavior.\" If my tribal affiliation and pronouns were not removed after the 5 days, then administrators would meet and make a decision whether I would be suspended (with or without pay) and/or immediately terminated.'\n\n\"The policy is billed by the board as a simple branding and communications policy. It came only months after Republican Gov. Kristi Noem sent a letter to the regents that railed against 'liberal ideologies' on college campuses and called for the board to ban drag shows on campus and 'remove all references to preferred pronouns in school materials,' among other things.\"",

Many starve themselves or develop other harmful eating behaviors to make their bodies conform to a masculine or feminine ideal. Studies estimate that 25% to more than 50% of trans people have had eating disorders, compared with 9% of the overall population.\n\n“Yet transition-related care is increasingly out of reach for minors struggling with gender dysphoria, the acute distress that results from a mismatch between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity. Most U.S. medical associations consider transition-related care to be essential for minors struggling with gender dysphoria.”\n",

That case is not expected to get underway until the summer of 2025, because [Officer Whitney] Schalk is currently on military duty.\n\n\"’The real case is the city of Defiance.

Although rumors suggested the player was transgender, this has not been confirmed. The athlete hit was uninjured, and her team won the game, but Trump used the incident to argue transgender athletes pose a physical danger to women.”\n\n“When Faulkner asked how he would enforce such a ban, Trump replied, ‘You just ban it. The president bans it. You just don’t let it happen. Not a big deal.’”\n",

He has investigated hospitals, LGBTQ+ organizations and providers of gender-affirming care, and has sought medical data of Texans who reside both in and out of the state. He has also likened gender-affirming care for youth to ‘child abuse’ in a nonbinding legal opinion, which Republican Gov. Greg Abbott cited in a letter instructing the state’s Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate parents who provide gender-affirming care for their children.”\n\n“Braden said it seems ‘fiscally infeasible’ for the department to roll back every legally obtained gender marker change on a state ID or license, but she expects that DPS will try to do so and that it especially will try to target people who need to renew their licenses.”\n",

About 37% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans strongly opposed allowing transgender athletes to play on the team that matches their gender identity.”\n\n“The BW poll shows that many Ohio voters don’t understand what it means to have protection for transgender and gender-nonconforming youth in schools, sports and bathrooms, said Madeline Korth, a therapist with NAMI Greater Cleveland who specializes in LGBTQ mental health.\n\n“’It’s framed as protecting children to not let transgender or gender-nonconforming youth play on sports teams or use bathrooms that match their gender identity, but what we know from the research — and certainly from my work as a therapist — is that it actually makes them markedly less safe,’ Korth said.”\n\n“When asked about laws that allow physicians to give gender transition medical care to someone under 18, overall nearly 60% strongly opposed it, while 7% strongly supported it. About 77% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats were strongly opposed.\n\n“When it came to allowing transgender athletes to play on the team that matches their gender identity, nearly 60% of overall respondents were strongly opposed, and nearly 7% strongly supported it.\n\n“Asked about allowing transgender people to use public bathrooms aligned with their gender identity, about 55% of all respondents were strongly opposed; about 11% strongly supported it.\n\n“When asked whether public schools should notify parents if a student identifies with a gender differ from their biological sex, about 30% of all responded said they strongly supported it; 18% strongly opposed it.

There are 26 states, including North Dakota and South Dakota, that have bans on gender-affirming care to minors, according to the Human Rights Campaign.”\n\n“Ahlin-Halverson said the Minnesota branch of the ACLU will focus its efforts on advocating for a gender inclusion bill that was introduced in the state’s last legislative session. The bill would guarantee student access to public school programs and extracurriculars regardless of gender identity. \n\n“’We think it would be an important protection for our LGBTQ+ in our school,’ Ahlin-Halverson said. ‘We will fight for the rights of any LGBTQ+ student who experiences discrimination in their school district.’\n\n“[Gender Justice’s Legal Director Jess] Braverman said they urge people to ‘read beyond the headlines’ on Trump’s administration before assuming their rights are gone. There is still an administrative process the Trump administration will have to go through, Braverman said, so people will not see their rights disappear immediately. \n\n“’Don’t just assume your rights are gone because that’s as good as them actually being gone,’ Braverman said.\"\n",

PFLAG is one of the oldest LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations in the U.S.\n\n“'It's not addressing any real problem in our community,' Ermels said. 'Instead, it's creating one, making people worried about something that just is not an issue.'\n\n\"Statewide advocates called the move one of the most extreme measures by a local government that further endangers LGBTQ+ participation in the public sphere. It follows a legislative session where lawmakers filed more than 100 bills that sought to regulate the lives of LGBTQ+ Texans. And it could lay the groundwork for a statewide version of the ordinance — similar to one that Texas lawmakers failed to pass in 2017.\"\n\n\"Under the amended ordinance, the city can seek fines of up to $500 and trespassing charges if a transgender person uses a restroom that matches the gender they identify as. The sweeping new terms also allow individuals to sue and seek no less than $10,000 in damages plus the cost of the lawsuit and attorney fees.\n\n\"The ban applies to 'any building, facility or space owned, leased or controlled by, or leased to, the city of Odessa including but not limited to community centers, libraries, airports, park facilities and administrative office buildings.'\"\n\n\"Brian Klosterboer, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Texas chapter, said the ordinance exposes the city to liability and 'puts a target on its back.' Unlike the legislature, which is protected by sovereign immunity and cannot be sued, the city is at risk of increased legal challenges.\"",

It was a text from a friend with reports of a new proposed state law, an early draft of what would become Senate Bill 254. The bill aimed, among other restrictions, to further restrict access to gender-affirming care. As Casey read, a wave of panic took hold. This was the news she had feared most. \n\n“After work, Casey’s head swirled. She first considered how she’d tell her transgender wife, Jamie, that their family of four would soon have to pack up their lives and leave the only place they’d ever called home. She then checked her bank account. She had about $3,000 saved. It wasn’t much, but Casey figured it was enough cash to quickly get her family across Florida state lines if necessary. \n\n“Over the next two months, Casey put her plan in place. She took on extra hours at work and listed their house on the market. The couple sold what they could — a camper, two canoes. When they learned the bill had been approved on Thursday, May 4, Casey didn’t hesitate. ‘I figured [Gov. Ron DeSantis] would sign it by 5 p.m. on Friday, so my goal was to be on the road by then,’ she recalls. \n\n“’We had about 24 hours.’\n\n“While  Americans today don’t typically uproot to protect their personal freedoms — taxes, sure — a wave of laws restricting interventions for transgender youth and limiting access to health care for adults has driven more people across the country to seek shelter in states with LGBTQ-friendly policies. \n\n“A recent KFF/Washington Post survey, for example, shows that one in four transgender adults have relocated for a more accepting environment. \n\n“’Calling this a new class of refugees is not overly dramatic,’ says Abbie Goldberg, the director of women’s and gender studies at Clark University, who has spent years surveying American LGBTQ families. ‘We know people’s sense of safety, value, and basic citizenship are profoundly impacted by legislative change. It feels like an explicit relegation to second-class citizenship.’”\n",

Musk claimed he was “tricked” into supporting his child’s transition and that the “woke mind virus” had effectively killed his “son.” However, Wilson’s own words and experiences tell a starkly different story—one that underscores the life-changing benefits of gender-affirming care and the importance of listening to transgender individuals themselves.”\n\n“Musk’s high-profile statements come at a time when several U.S. states and entire countries are pushing to criminalize gender-affirming treatments for minors, and some political commentators are suggesting that adopting anti-transgender stances could be electorally advantageous. Yet these positions fly in the face of established medical consensus and the lived experiences of transgender individuals like Wilson.”\n\n“Wilson’s story provides a powerful counterpoint to her father’s claims.

The theater company has been visiting Lakeland schools for 20 years.”\n\n“Arnold said she hadn’t reached out to MCT and had no plans to after parents in the audience approached her with their concerns.”\n\n“The mission of the theater group is to empower children and adults through theater education and performance, Morelli said. ‘We include everyone, and we prohibit any kind of unlawful harassment to our employees due to their identities. There is a reality that our employees are expected to do their jobs, and we ask that people not be harassed.’”",

While millions struggle under the weight of medical debt and economic precarity, our political class has masterfully redirected public anger toward a manufactured crisis: the supposed threat of transgender Americans. By scapegoating trans people, they divert attention from the systemic failures killing and impoverishing our neighbors. This phenomenon is what sociologists call displacement, where economic anger and despair are redirected onto marginalized groups rather than the systems and structures that are actually causing the suffering. While the threats to trans people are real and growing, the threat of trans people is a nonexistent distraction, and attacking us will do nothing to address Americans’ real material concerns.”",

The trend picked up steam, with brands like Verizon and Netflix working with Lebron on sponsored content, and celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Rodrigo and Gillian Anderson using the phrase in their own videos.\n\n“Last week, Lebron, who is trans, announced that the buzz around her videos had changed her life, and said she can now finance her transition due to her internet fame.\n\n“But it’s not all good news: Lebron posted (and then deleted) a teary-eyed TikTok revealing that she ‘didn’t trademark fast enough’. According to TMZ, a man in Washington state named Jefferson Bates filed to trademark ‘Very Demure .. Very Mindful ...” n an apparent attempt to cash in on Lebron’s success.”\n\n“’If I were her, I wouldn’t be worried,” said Alli Elmunzer, an attorney and founder of Influencer Legal, a law firm that helps content creators navigate trademark and contract issues. ‘It’s very clear that she was the first to use it – she should start monetizing it, because that only gives strength to her case of being the first.’\n\n“According to Elmunzer, Bates filed a $1bn trademark application, which declares an intent to use a trademark. ‘He’s saying he’s planning to use it, but hasn’t yet,’ Elmunzer said. ‘This gives [Lebron] a leg up, because when she opposes, she can say he’s not using it and she is, and she has all this proof.’\n\n“Along with that, US trademark law recognizes the first person to use a trademark, not the first person to file it. ‘I have no doubt that Lebron will be able to successfully oppose this, and there’s a pathway for her to get the trademark, but it will cost her time and money to get it.’”\n",

The goal is to protect students whose safety could be threatened if they live in unwelcoming households.\"\n\n\"Lawmakers approved the legislation along party lines after more than an hour of an emotional debate in which Democratic LGBTQ+ senators recounted stories about how they delayed coming out to their parents or were outed by someone else. They argued gender-noncomforming students should be able to come out to their families on their own terms. But Republican lawmakers said the state shouldn’t dictate whether school districts can enforce so-called parental notification policies and that schools have an obligation to be transparent with parents.\"\n\n\"The bill now heads to the state Assembly, where it would need to pass in committees and on the floor before it can reach the desk of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose administration has fought school boards over the notification policies.\"\n\n\"State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, who is lesbian, said on the Senate floor Thursday that she was outed to her mother when Menjivar was 16 years old.\n\n“'I came home to literally all my things on the front lawn, because I was kicked out,' the Democrat representing the San Fernando Valley said. 'That’s what happens when parents don’t accept queer kids.'\n\n\"Menjivar then went back into the closet so that she could continue living at home, she said. She didn’t come out again to her mother until she was 25 years old. Her mother is still not accepting, Menjivar, now 35, said.\n\n“'There are many queer kids in California who have these stories,' she said.\"",

Ayala Senior High School in San Bernardino County, has endured bullying ranging from name-calling and teasing to being singled out and shamed by marching band administrators, according to the teen and his mom, who filed complaints that were largely substantiated in a district investigation. \n\n“Last month, the student said he hurt his back when another student knocked over a table for the campus LGBTQ club. His mother filed a police report, and the other student was arrested, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. \n\n“The incidents taken together illustrate an atmosphere of hostility toward the LGBTQ community within the Chino Valley Unified School District, said the student and his supporters. The district was the first in the state to introduce so-called parental notification policies, which require staff to report transgender students to their care providers; the district policy is not currently being enforced.\n\n“Though much of the rhetoric out of Chino has focused on transgender students, the teen — who is not transgender — and his supporters said the bullying directed at him underscores the wider repercussions of those policies, which harm all queer kids by promoting discrimination and hate and leaving kids feeling unsupported.”\n\n“[T]eachers, parents and other school staff said there are problems across the campuses with bullying directed at LGBTQ students, including frequent use of queer slurs. And they say the troubles are supported by a school board that frequently uses anti-LGBTQ language in discussing district policies.\n\n“[Chino Valley board of education president Sonja] Shaw has said that some students may be better served by ‘non-affirming homes’ that don’t support their gender or sexuality. Other board members have referred to the transgender community as a ‘death culture’ that needs to be stopped.”\n",

It stems from misinformation and lies about our health care, about our lives and who we are. It’s policies that go against the advice of the Alberta Medical Association and Canadian Paediatric Society.

She then encouraged the school board to pass a policy to ‘keep teacher’s individuality in the closet when it comes to age-appropriate sensitivity and controversial issues that don’t sit well with parents with young children.’”\n\n“Many parents have complained specifically about a classroom poster that referred to alternative pronouns, and comments the teacher made about it being OK for boys to wear dresses. Parents have implied that simply expressing alternative pronouns — the teacher uses they/them pronouns — is inappropriate for young children.”\n\n“The teacher remains on leave while the district investigates the complaints.”\n\n“In a letter that Superintendent Stacy Yao shared with parents around the time the teacher was placed on leave, Yao stated that instruction and materials addressing sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression are ‘not approved’ by the district for transitional kindergarten (TK). ‘Based on state guidance, these topics are not age-appropriate for TK students and are not taught,’ Yao wrote.\n\n“But state and local regulations suggest otherwise. State standards relating to gender in early childhood education focus on discussing common stereotypes and biases, and the role of gender in social and emotional development. School districts can also put in place policies that promote certain materials or curriculum.”\n\n“Parents can opt their children out of certain instruction, such as for sexual education or other sensitive topics, but gender is not considered in that category, said experts in academic policy.”\n\n“’We’re constantly talking to and teaching kids about gender — before kids are born, the second after they’re born,’ said Robert Marx, an assistant professor of child and adolescent development at San Jose State University. ‘Kids are being bombarded with gender, and part of the role of educators is to build on kids’ existing knowledge to help them understand misconceptions and provide them with accurate information — including that there are people in the world who use they/them pronouns.’”\n",

Mr. Weston brought the reporter into the sitting room, where he handed over a certificate recently signed by his doctor. The certificate stated, ‘This is to certify that Mr. Mark Weston, who has always been brought up as a female, is a male, and should continue life as such.”\n\n“Mr. Weston, born in 1905 in Plymouth, had been labeled a girl for most of his life. Throughout his sports career, he played in women’s leagues. But in early 1936, he began seeing a doctor about living as a man. He checked into Charing Cross Hospital for what turned out to be two sex-reassignment operations — one in April, another in May. Mr. Weston explained to the reporter, ‘I realize I am now in my true element.’”\n\n“When I first encountered this historical coverage of Mr. Weston, I saw that we had missed a chance to chart an alternate path — to organize sports without the regimes of gender surveillance that dominate it today. We still have an opportunity, though, to design policies that acknowledge male and female sports categories as imperfect and permeable and that place the humanity and dignity of athletes first and foremost.\n\n“Advocates of sex-testing policies cloak themselves in the guise of fairness; they exist, proponents claim, to exclude anyone with a perceived biological advantage in women’s sports. That group ranges from trans women, who are banned from most major sports even after undergoing a medical transition, to many cisgender and intersex women who have not undergone any medical transition but who have testosterone levels considered higher than normal for women. Yet little evidence supports the idea that these women have physical advantages, in strength or otherwise, over other women.”\n",

The following year, after same-sex marriage was declared legal in the city, Harris was involved in conducting marriages for same-sex couples, which she called ‘one of the most joyful’ moments of her career.”\n\n“However, while Harris’ track record spoke for itself, she was on shaky ground with the community during the 2020 presidential election over her history as a prosecutor and what some described as a misstep on trans issues and sex work.\n\n“American lawyer and queer rights activist Chase Strangio wrote in 2019 that he was not ready to trust Harris on LGBTQ+ issues because of her work as ‘an arm of the state fighting to lock people in cages and defending policies that destroyed lives and communities.’\n\n“He went on to claim: ‘Now attempting to position herself as a criminal legal system reformer and an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, Harris seeks to rewrite her past rather than own it.’\n\n“Those missteps included her support for a state decision to block gender-affirming medical care for women in prison in 2015. Years later, she claimed the move was approved without her consultation, and that she was forced to defend the state’s decision.\n\n“LGBTQ+ sex workers have also harshly criticised Harris for supporting a package of bills in 2018 that would have [in fact, did] shut down sites used by sex workers.\n\n“Courtney Trouble, a non-binary sex worker, said she felt Harris was ‘really proud’ of the work she had done in supporting the bills, and that was something ‘that really needs to be discussed with her’, adding: ‘If that’s how she feels about sex workers’ rights, then she has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be her supporters.’”\n",

Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) told The New York Times on Wednesday. ‘I don’t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don’t think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports.’\n\n“’Democrats aren’t saying that, and they should be,’ said Suozzi, who narrowly won reelection Tuesday.”\n\n“Suozzi had already exited Congress [in 2022] when a proposal to ban transgender women and girls from female school sports teams made its way to the House floor, where it ultimately passed along party lines. \n\n“Suozzi’s office did not respond to emailed questions about whether Suozzi would have supported that bill or whether he would support similar legislation in the next Congress.”\n\n\"Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) similarly blamed Harris and Democrats’ unwillingness to move on trans athletes for the party’s election night losses.\"\n\n“A spokesperson for the Congressional Equality Caucus [which promotes LGBTQ equality in the House] did not return an email or text message seeking comment.”\n",

Then you train some more, keep competing, keep winning, and if you’re good enough and lucky enough, you find yourself at the highest level of your sport, vying for gold medals against the best of the best.\n\n“But now, some transgender athletes—in particular trans women who have clawed their way to the upper echelon of their sport—are locked out of the competition. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, many sports now require trans women to have transitioned before puberty. At a time when gender affirming care is increasingly difficult to access, some elite competitions have flat-out banned trans women from participating. So while non-binary athletes like middle-distance runner Nikki Hiltz and soccer star Quinn are crushing it in Paris, it’s been impossible for most trans women to qualify. (Though the absence of trans women in Olympic competition has not stopped people from fixating on cis boxer Imane Khelif with bigotry and gender panic.)”\n\n“Cosmopolitan spoke with four trans athletes across different sports and countries about the increasing hostility, the tightening rules, and how the fight for inclusion has affected their training and daily lives.”\n",

The inclusive impulse on Day One is to have everyone in class introduce themselves and share their pronouns, so nobody is singled out. But many don’t think about pronouns. Even for me, as a nonbinary law professor who uses ‘they,” it’s never easy. Others must feel even more awkward when prompted to share their preferences. Hounded by the pronoun police and the gender warriors, what are we to do? My answer? Radical empathy.”\n\n“In whatever settings in which we find ourselves, should we police pronouns? My answer is a hearty no. The process of inclusion matters just as much as the result. To be inclusive, we must bring people in — not shame them into it.\n\n“When I start teaching a class, I don’t insist on pronoun identification. When I stand before my class with my mannish body in women’s clothes, students know the score. But I want to make it clear that my classroom is a safe space where people can identify, or not. Explicitly bringing up preferred pronouns can scare people away from sincere and open conversations about gender. Those will happen organically.”\n\n“Younger people shouldn’t have to go through the struggles that plagued me. When pronouns come up, that should be a moment for conversation, exchange and trust-building. People shouldn’t refer to me as ‘they’ out of fear, but out of understanding and respect. It is only through spreading this compassion that we can permanently shift how we understand gender. . . .  In the end, when we get weary, like Otis Redding says, we should all try a little tenderness.”\n",

One thing has become abundantly clear: providers of gender care also provide other types of essential care to the general population.  \n\n“While it’s true that a small number of provider specialists work solely at gender health clinics, the majority of people who provide gender-affirming care work in diverse fields of medicine, including pediatrics, adolescent medicine, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and endocrinology, and are critical to providing lots of other types of care to all types of patients. \n\n“For example, one family medicine provider in the Midwest which provides gender-affirming care is also a key provider in a rural medicine clinic that serves multiple counties. That provider delivers babies, prescribes antidepressants, diagnoses acute health incidents and provides general primary care to people of all ages. Should the state pass a ban and cause this provider to move to a permissive state, the entire patient population will suffer. \n\n“Even someone like a pediatric endocrinologist typically has a large patient panel of youth with diabetes or thyroid conditions. When these providers leave a banned state because they feel targeted and cannot provide this medically necessary care the state loses these critical services. This leaves a large patient population without an essential healthcare provider. \n\n“An increasing number of clinicians are moving to other parts of the country due to gender-affirming care bans and the politicization of medicine. Laws banning essential care for transgender patients interfere with providers’ medical judgment and ability to make healthcare decisions with patients and families. Additionally, providers must take on heavy administrative and financial burdens to stay up to date on the legal landscape. Together, these conditions often are the cause of medial brain drain.”\n\n“Health care is one of our most universal needs as a country, but the bans on medical care for transgender youth are making it harder for all children and adolescents, trans or not, to access the care they need. We all need access to well-trained and compassionate healthcare providers. “\n",

Of those enrolled in school, nearly a third (29 percent) reported attending a school with at least one anti-LGBTQ+ policy. Queer youth ages 13 to 17 reported higher rates of attending a school with at least one anti-LGBTQ+ policy (43 percent), compared to those ages 18 to 24 (16 percent).\n\n“Queer students attending a school with a high number of anti-LGBTQ+ policies reported higher rates of recent anxiety and depression (78 percent and 67 percent), compared to their LGBTQ+ peers at schools with fewer (70 percent and 56 percent) or no anti-LGBTQ+ policies (63 percent and 49 percent).\n\n“LGBTQ+ youth at schools with a high number of anti-LGBTQ+ policies also reported higher rates of seriously considering [self harm] in the past year (55 percent), compared to their LGBTQ+ peers at schools with fewer (43 percent) or no anti-LGBTQ+ policies (35 percent). Furthermore, they reported higher rates of attempting [self harm] in the past year (24 percent), compared to their LGBTQ+ peers at schools with fewer (13 percent) or no anti-LGBTQ+ policies (9 percent).\n\n“More than 550 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in 2023, and 80 were passed into law, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Just over halfway through 2024, 527 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced, with 44 passed into law. The majority target transgender children, with many restricting their bathroom usage.\"",

Andy Beshear had vetoed a series of bills from GOP lawmakers to prevent transgender girls from participating in school sports and ban gender affirming health care for transgender youth.\n\n“The all-Republican legislature had overridden the vetos. But his opponent in the state’s 2023 gubernatorial election, Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron, had seized on the opportunity and leaned into anti-trans messaging in his campaign. Cameron began arguing that Beshear supported a ‘radical gender ideology.’\n\n“The rhetoric was working. Internal polling from Beshear’s campaign found that voters who otherwise were inclined to support the Democratic leader were wavering. Beshear’s team knew they needed to respond – the question was how.\n\n“National polls showed that while many Americans favored protections for transgender people against discrimination, support for policies that allowed people to use bathrooms and participate on sports teams that matched their gender identity were mixed, even among Democrats.”\n\n“Thomas J. Billard, executive director of the Center for Applied Transgender Studies in Chicago argues that LGBTQ+ advocates and politicians are in a ‘losing rhetorical position,’ on the issue, because explaining the biology behind gender and sex is complicated, particularly in the context of athletics. \n\n“Instead, he said political figures should seek to reframe the issue in the context of empathy for children by emphasizing inclusion.  \n\n“’When we're talking about trans participation in school athletics, we're talking about telling this six-year-old kid that they can't play a game with their friends,’ Billard said. ‘That is to me, where opposition to these bans is headed.’\n\n“Still, he and other advocates USA TODAY spoke to said they worried that Democrats who are typically supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, including President Joe Biden, may shy away from addressing anti-trans rhetoric in campaigns altogether because of fear about the counter messaging challenges.”\n",

The former president’s proposed ‘plan to protect children from left-wing gender insanity’ includes ordering federal agencies to end all programs that ‘promote … gender transition at any age’; revoking funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to youth and subjecting them to US justice department investigations; punishing schools that affirm trans youth; and pushing a federal law stating the government doesn’t legally recognize trans people.”\n\n“Trump has also pledged to rescind federal LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination policies, which could mean a loss of protections in housing, healthcare, employment, education and a range of federal programs. He has promised new credentialing for teachers to ‘promote positive education about the nuclear family, the roles of mothers and fathers’. The Republican platform calls for advancing a ‘culture that values the sanctity of marriage’.”\n\n“Project 2025, the rightwing manifesto authored by Trump allies, is even more explicit, saying Biden-Harris pro-LGBTQ+ policies should be replaced by ones supporting the ‘formation of stable, married, nuclear families’ and ‘heterosexual, intact marriage’.”\n",

'They speak to the same kind of oppressive forces, and so I’m very concerned.'\"\n\n\"Klemer, who is serving her first term as a city councilor, said she felt the resolution was an opportunity to make a difference in the city, and related it to her own experience coming out as gay in the 1980s.\n\n“'The first thing I was told was, nobody needs to know, don’t tell anybody,' Klemer said. 'It’s a lousy way to live, and I think we should all be able to come out and be who we are and not have to hide.'\n\n\"Several members of the local trans community also attended Thursday’s meeting to speak in favor of the resolution. Mariel Addis, a resident of Florence, said she transitioned from male to female in 2016, right before Trump was elected president for his first term.\n\n“'Word on the street for trans folks was, get your paperwork done, driver’s licenses, passports, birth certificates and whatnot just in case Trump won the election, which of course he did,' Addis said of her experience. 'The Trump administration didn’t personally impact me greatly, but I wouldn’t say so much for people that were in the military that happen to be transgender. But at this current point, I’m very concerned about the status of trans people in this country.'\"",

Justin Sparks, R-Wildwood, said he’s heard enough complaints from constituents that he’s calling for investigations and holding a press conference Friday outside the gym.”\n\n“Montano has been a daily gym-goer at Life Time since joining Sunday. She said in an interview with the Post-Dispatch that she met with the general manager on Sunday because she wanted to know the center’s policies regarding transgender members.\n\n“Montano said she began transitioning about two years ago and has been taking medications for the past 12 months.\n\n“She said she has largely had positive interactions with other gym members. She met with a personal trainer, swims in the facility’s pool and uses the cardio workout equipment. Many people have gone out of their way to make her feel welcome, she said.\n\n“The lone exception, she said, was a confrontation with a woman in the center’s sauna on Monday.\n\n“’She kept telling me that I was a man, that I didn’t belong there,’  Montano recalled.”\n\n“Natalie Bushaw, a spokesperson for Life Time, said the center recognizes ‘that there are varying opinions regarding locker room access. As a company, we are committed to following the law in every area we operate with respect to public accommodation.’”\n\n“Ellisville Police Capt. Andy Vaughn said the department is not investigating.\n\n“’To my knowledge, no law has been broken,’ he said.”\n\n“Sparks said he wants the Missouri Department of Revenue to investigate how, and when, Montano’s driver’s license was changed.”\n\n“He said he also reached out to Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey for an investigation. Bailey’s office did not respond to interview requests.\n\n“Sparks on Thursday posted a nearly six-minute video on Facebook voicing his complaints. In response to Sparks and others on social media, some Life Time users said they were canceling their memberships and encouraged others to boycott the center, saying it needed ‘the Bud Light treatment,’ referring to the backlash the beer brand received after a promotion involving Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender woman.\n\n“Montano on Facebook referenced the press conference Sparks is planning, saying a ‘mob of hateful people’ would appear to ‘show me how much they hate me for existing as a trans woman with rights.’”\n",

At the same time, more than six in 10 U.S. adults oppose laws banning gender-affirming care for minors.\n\n\"There are significant demographic differences in Americans' views of the morality of changing one’s gender. Majorities of political liberals (81%), Democrats (72%), those who do not identify with a religion (67%), those who do not attend religious services regularly (59%), young adults aged 18 to 29 (56%) and college graduates (53%) believe changing genders is morally acceptable. Less than half of their counterparts say the same.\n\n\"While slightly less than half of women believe in the moral acceptability of changing genders, they are significantly more likely than men to think as much (48% vs. 39%, respectively).\n\n\"These subgroup readings, from Gallup’s annual Values and Beliefs poll, conducted May 1-23, are not meaningfully different from the two prior readings in 2021 and 2023.\n\n\"In recent years, lawmakers in many U.S. states have attempted to limit or ban access to gender-affirming care for minors. These treatments generally can include psychological counseling, puberty blockers or hormone treatments.\"\n\n\"Gallup gauges Americans’ support for laws banning such care for minors with two questions, each asked of half of the total sample. One question asks about bans in general terms, on 'treatments and medical procedures,' while the other spells out some of the specific treatments that could be banned, such as 'psychological support, hormonal treatments and medical surgeries' to help minors align with their gender identity.\n\n\"The two question versions yield statistically similar results. In both cases, a little more than one-third of U.S. adults favor laws banning gender-affirming care, and just over six in 10 oppose such laws.\"\n\n",

Tim Walz as left-wing radicals whose administration would initiate a seismic cultural shift meant to undermine conservative values, especially when it comes to advancing protections for transgender Americans.\n\n“It’s a strategy meant to excite conservative voters and win over parts of the center, but surveys suggest it risks backfiring, with LGBTQ people and their allies using threats and misinformation spread as a rallying cry to drive voters to the polls for Democrats.”\n\n“’This is your Trump campaign mode, that is speaking viscerally to the Republican base and trying to paint a reality that does not necessarily exist to try to mobilize voters,’ said Gabriele Magni, an assistant professor of political science at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.\n\n“But Magni said the tactic may have an unintended consequence that could end up hurting Trump and helping his opponents. \n\n“’If we take a look at surveys that ask voters what their priorities are, trans rights are usually not very high,’ Magni said. ‘There is a group of voters for whom that is a very high priority, and it’s not just transgender folks, not just trans voters, but it’s also their families, whose lives have been impacted by the decisions made by different states in the last couple of years. These voters are highly motivated to show up.’”\n\n“A staggering 94 percent of LGBTQ voters surveyed by the LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD in January, when President Biden was still the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said they are highly motivated to vote in November’s election, with 84 percent indicating they are ‘definitely’ voting. More than half — 53 percent — said they would oppose a candidate who ‘speaks frequently about restricting access to health care and participation in sports for transgender youth.’”\n\n“While it represents a tiny fraction of the U.S. population — estimates range from 0.5 percent to around 1.6 percent — the political power of transgender Americans is growing.\n\n“A ‘Trans Folks for Harris’ Zoom call organized by Advocates for Trans Equality raked in more than $26,000, [executive director of Advocates for Trans Equality, Rodrigo] Heng-Lehtinen said, and more than 50 transgender delegates voted at last week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Seventeen percent of delegates identified as LGBTQ, according to convention officials. \n\n“Democratic leaders in public statements and conversations on the convention floor promised to protect LGBTQ rights, though transgender issues were rarely talked about outright, and a trans speaker was notably absent from the stage. Anti-transgender rhetoric took on a much more prominent role during July’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where prominent GOP figures railed against trans peoples’ pronouns and criticized the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports.”\n ",

These policy and legal campaigns over the last four years have served as a testing ground for the messages in the ads.”\n\n“These ads [are] also evidence of how quickly anti-trans politics have gone mainstream in recent years years, driven by Republicans but on Democrats’ watch. \n\n“Over the last seven years, the number of people who say a man or a woman is defined by the sex assigned at their birth has actually increased, according to Pew Research Center.”\n\n“’Already half the states have passed some kind of anti-trans legislation, specifically dealing with kids. So you already have a ripe environment for this issue, for a political constituency already engaged around this,’ Jones told me. ‘And it’s making it harder for Democrats to try to find their footing and a response.’”\n",

His proposals would terminate Medicare and Medicaid funding for hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to trans youth, attempt to charge teachers with sex discrimination for affirming students’ gender identities and order federal agencies to 'cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.' Trump also pledged to ask Congress to halt the use of federal funds to promote or pay for gender-affirming care, without distinguishing between care for adults or minors.\"\n\n\"In the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a purported roadmap of executive actions that a future Republican president could take on various issues — including abortion access — several of the policy suggestions align with Trump’s promises to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Project 2025 advocates for the deletion of the terms 'sexual orientation and gender identity' from all federal rules and for prohibiting teachers from affirming trans students.\n\n\"One of the more extreme proposals in Project 2025 equates the act of being transgender, or 'transgender ideology,' to pornography, and declares that it should be outlawed. The conservative think tank recommends that educators and public librarians who spread the concept of being transgender should be registered as sex offenders, and that telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate the spread of ideas about transgender people should be shuttered.\"",

The Cupertino Education Association says it wants to protect the identity of the teacher to prevent further harassment.”\n\n“During the meeting, multiple people claimed the teacher told four-year-old transitional kindergarten (TK) students that it was OK for boys to wear a dress and had inappropriate materials in the classroom. The union says the teacher has not veered away from the approved curriculum and is simply being inclusive. Still, some parents voiced their opposition.”\n\n“About 35 people spoke at the meeting in person and called in. Sophi Scarnewman, a CUSD parent and the sister of the trans teacher at the center of the controversy, showed up to the meeting and talked about the methods her sibling uses in the classroom.\n\n\"’It’s just a drawing of children with different pronouns next to them. That’s what the drawing is. People are making so much more out of this than it truly is,’ said Scarnewman.\n\n“Both teachers and parents asked the district to create a clearer policy about gender issues in the classroom. The district says that because this issue was not on tonight’s agenda, they will not make any decisions about policy.\"",

Tim Walz, who’s emerged as a top contender for Vice President Harris’s running mate, helped turn Minnesota into a refuge for LGBTQ Americans, signing laws that shield access to gender-affirming health care and abortion, ban conversion therapy and make it illegal for libraries to ban books solely because they have LGBTQ themes or characters.\n\n“Under Walz’s leadership, Minnesota has solidified itself as a liberal stronghold in the largely conservative Midwest, though the governor has long supported progressive issues like LGBTQ equality. \n\n“In 1999, Walz, then a 35-year-old social studies teacher at Mankato West High School, advised the school’s first gay-straight alliance (GSA), a student-led club supporting LGBTQ students and families. Later, in 2006, Walz ousted a longtime Republican member of Congress in a largely rural district, running on a platform that included support for same-sex marriage, which the state banned in 1997.”\n\n“Walz, who has served as governor of Minnesota since 2019, in a March 2023 executive order made the state among the first to protect seekers and providers of gender-affirming health care from prosecution by states with bans in effect. The following month, Walz signed legislation safeguarding access to care. \n\n“On both occasions, Walz held signing ceremonies at the state capitol in St. Paul, where he was flanked by supporters. While signing his executive order, Walz held the hand of 12-year-old Hildie Edwards, a transgender girl who testified in support of the state’s trans refuge bill in February.”\n\n“’He’s very open-spirited, very generously spirited. He asks questions about you, and he remembers the answers. He encourages me,’ said Minnesota Rep. Leigh Finke, a Democrat and the first openly transgender person elected to the state’s Legislature. \n\n“Finke, the author and primary sponsor of Minnesota’s trans refuge bill, said Walz was a source of moral support last year, when Finke was the target of a nationwide pressure campaign led by far-right conservatives, who falsely claimed the bill would allow children to medically transition without parental consent and promoted the baseless claim that Finke and other trans people were ‘grooming’ children to abuse them.”\n",

Paxton in the complaint called Lau 'a scofflaw who is putting the health and safety of minors at risk.'\n\n\"Lau and UT Southwestern did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the gender-affirming care law in June 2023. The law states that the medical license of any doctor providing drugs or surgery for the purpose of gender transition to minors must be revoked.\n\n\"Lau wrote almost all of the prescriptions shortly before the law took effect in September 2023 so that her patients could fill them later, according to the complaint, but Paxton said that counted as providing banned care after the law took effect. He also said that Lau wrote two illegal testosterone prescriptions while the law was in effect.\n\n\"Paxton further claimed that Lau falsified records to conceal the fact that her patients were transgender, violating Texas's business code.\n\n\"The lawsuit seeks money damages and a court order preventing Lau from violating the law in the future.\"",

While she was leaving the bathroom, Walztoni says his daughter said that she was surrounded by that student and two others, who began following Sovereign down the hall, and when she turned around to ask them to stop, she was punched in the mouth.\n\n\"During the attack, according to Walztoni, Sovereign’s jaw was broken in two places. She had a compound fracture and lost teeth, leading to reconstructive surgery. Walztoni says the students responsible should face criminal charges.\n\n\"'There has to be repercussions for their actions. And if they are not charged for some reason, which is our fear, then that is just going to further escalate their behavior because when you get away with stuff, you continue to do stuff,' he said. 'There needs to be some kind of punishment and there needs to be some serious discussion as to whether those kids should be able to come back to the same school.'\n\n\"He also says he was notified about the incident from a social worker at the school and was told by school officials to notify the police, adding that he was displeased the incident 'wasn’t treated as an emergency.'\"\n\n\"Minnesota state Rep. Leigh Finke, a Democrat and the first out transgender lawmaker in the state’s legislature, condemned the school and police for their responses to the incident. Finke said violence against transgender youth like Benedict and Sovereign will 'continue unabated until accountability and responsibility is accepted.'\"\n\n“'We want to see Hopkins High School and Minnetonka Police, and every school and police department in the future to do what is right and take immediate action, not because people are looking, but because transgender folks everywhere are entitled to live a life free of fear, and violence,' Finke added.\"\n\n",

They are looking for reasons to be optimistic, such as Sarah McBride’s election in Delaware, which will make her the first out transgender member of Congress. But most just feel gutted — in part because they believe Trump will carry through on his promises to strip away their rights.”\n\n“LGBTQ+ rights organizations have challenged the notion that voters found Trump’s anti-transgender message appealing, and polls have shown that many Americans support transgender rights. Still, the fact that such a message was so core to Trump’s winning campaign says something about the American electorate, according to transgender people and their family members.”\n\n“Erin Reed, a transgender activist and independent journalist who has written extensively about the trans community, said there is ‘a lot of despair’ out there among queer people.”\n\n“Those in the trans community are also worried that Democrats will abandon them now based on a perception that defending them is too costly politically, Reed said; they’re wondering, ‘How do we manage to not get thrown under the bus?’\n\n“Many Democrats have voiced solidarity with the queer community, and queer leaders and organizations are doing outreach to make sure queer people are OK and to push back against Republican narratives that dehumanize transgender people — which is all vital, but not enough, said Honey Mahogany, executive director of the San Francisco Office of Transgender Initiatives.\n\n“’I would like to see solidarity from other communities, assurances that we are all in this together and then collective organizing,’ she said.\n\n“Both she and Reed said transgender voices are too often left out of the discussion about transgender lives, and said that must stop.\n\n“Milo Easley, a senior at Redlands High School, agrees. He wants more people to talk about transgender issues — just not in the way Trump does, with ‘so much negativity’ and ‘a lot of fearmongering.’\n\n“He is trying to stay positive — including about the future, where he sees ‘a lot of room for improvement’ — but it’s tough.\n\n“[Avery] Poznanski also feels lucky to live in California, and to be receiving gender-affirming healthcare, but worries about young people in less-friendly states who don’t have access to such treatment.\n\n“But Poznanski is also hopeful and determined to live.\n\n“’Our existences are politicized,’ they said. ‘But just living is an act of resistance.’”\n",

Under terms of the settlement, both entities have been mandated to prevent discrimination and violence against transgender, gender non-conforming, nonbinary, and/or intersex (TGNCNBI) people.”\n\n“’I was abused because of who I am by those who were supposed to protect me, and I don’t wish that on anyone,’ said LeTray, who was represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union and Legal Services of Central New York.”\n\n“’I was lucky enough to survive this,’ she said. ‘But other trans people might not be as lucky.’”\n\n“’It’s our position that every county and every police department should have a policy like this,’ NYCLU staff attorney JP Perry said. ‘They really should be standard practice in this day and age in New York.’\n\n“The settlement comes as state lawmakers try to approve a long-stalled bill that would enact uniform training policies statewide addressing the treatment of trans, nonbinary, and intersex people in custody, but the legislation has not yet passed. \n\n“The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Julia Salazar (D), would require correctional facilities across the state to implement policies similar to those that Jefferson County agreed to adopt.\n\n“Salazar said a resurgence of anti-trans rhetoric, inspired in part by the Trump campaign and his Republican allies, has made reform even more urgent, and she had a message for people who support other fundamental rights like reproductive freedom but oppose bills helping trans and gender conforming people.\n\n“’These fights are inextricably linked,’ she said.”\n",

Skrmetti, is about whether bans on gender-affirming care for minors amount to unconstitutional sex discrimination. \n\n“The plaintiffs—three Tennessee transgender youth and their families—argue that the state law clearly discriminates based on sex because it bans medical providers from prescribing puberty blockers and hormone treatments to transgender youth but allows those same therapies for cisgender kids. (To put a finer point on it, under the law, Senate Bill 1, a minor assigned female at birth can take estrogen, while a minor assigned male cannot.) The Department of Justice argues that the Tennessee law violates equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n\n“But Michelle Banker, senior director of reproductive rights and health litigation at the National Women’s Law Center, said Tennessee is ‘just flat wrong on the law to be relying on Dobbs in this way.’ And the error can be traced back to Justice Alito himself.\n\n“In what essentially amounts to an aside in the text of the Dobbs decision, Alito wrote that state abortion bans don’t violate the equal protection clause, even though that was not an official question in the case. \n\n“’The [equal protection] discussion in Dobbs is what we call “dicta,” meaning that it doesn’t have the force of law because the issue wasn’t before the court,’ Banker said. ‘The court had no business making a statement about it in that case, and courts shouldn’t be relying on it now.’ (Unfortunately, it’s not the only instance of extraneous Alito comments setting a trap for people’s rights—the same can be said of the 2014 Hobby Lobby case about birth control.)\n\n“In this same section, Alito cited a 1974 case, Geduldig v. Aiello, which held that pregnancy discrimination didn’t violate equal protection. Banker said the reasoning Alito applied in invoking Geduldig has been ‘rejected over and over,’ but Tennessee cites it several times as well.\n\n“If the Supreme Court blesses this line of reasoning, states could use the precedent to attack other forms of health care. Banker said that Tennessee’s argument could have ‘really radical implications’—and pointed to birth control, as well as certain fertility treatments that would likely end up endangered.”\n",

The employees had challenged the denial of medically necessary treatment for their gender dysphoria under the state’s categorical exclusion of coverage for ‘gender reassignment or modification services or supplies.’”\n\n“Walker wrote in his ruling that health and pension benefits frequently represent a crucial component of an employee’s compensation, so the practical effect of denying or reducing such benefits on the basis of sex is to deny the employee an employment opportunity on the basis of sex. Walker found that the treatment of all medical conditions, including gender dysphoria, should be based on the unique needs of the patient rather than blanket exclusions.\n\n“The court will schedule a trial to determine the amount of plaintiffs’ damages.”\n",

In fact, of more than 20 issues the pollsters asked about, transgender rights ranked dead last in importance to voters overall.”\n\n“In other words, this is a nonissue.”\n\n“So what exactly is going on here? Is it as simple as demonizing a vulnerable group of people to score political points in a close race? Or is it something deeper?\n\n“’What Republicans are seeing or feeling is that people are anxious about the future,’ M. Gessen said in a conversation about the ads with a New York Times opinion editor last week.\n\n“”They’re anxious about their economic future,’ said Gessen, a nonbinary journalist who frequently writes about LGBTQ+ issues. ‘They’re anxious about their social future. And it can all be boiled down to this anxiety about one’s children — that one’s children are going to come home from school one day and speak a different language than the parents or use a different name and generally be a stranger.’”\n\n“There’s no law against lying in political ads, but I’m guessing Trump’s inane ramblings about school sex-change operations are too bizarre even for his ad makers. Picking on transgender incarcerated people and migrants must have seemed like the next best option. But the message is always about fear.\n\n“This presidential campaign is going to be over soon. But the damage Trump has done to transgender people — by fomenting fear, by scapegoating, by ‘othering’ — will most assuredly live on.”\n",

    "selftext": "“When the US Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule in May asserting that gender dysphoria can be considered a disability under federal anti-discrimination laws, it codified what the overwhelming majority of courts have found for nearly a decade. The new rule put states on notice: Discrimination against transgender people in employment, education, health care, child care, housing, and elsewhere may violate federal disability protections, and the Biden administration was prepared to fight it.\n\n“Now, in a lawsuit led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, 17 states are asking a federal court to strike down the rule in its entirety, including numerous provisions that have nothing to do with trans people. This isn’t a random collection of states; 15 of them have passed restrictions on gender-affirming care, and all have embraced myriad anti-trans policies.”\n\n“But gender dysphoria is just part of the 130-page federal rule. It also protects disabled parents’ rights in child welfare cases and prevents hospitals from using disability as a factor in determining who gets care in crisis situations, such as equipment shortages during a pandemic. It adds Long Covid to the list of conditions that may constitute a disability and strengthens protections against unnecessary institutionalization, requiring that care be offered in the least restrictive setting and, ideally, in a patient’s community.” \n\n“Striking down the entire rule would have wide-reaching implications for all disabled Americans and other marginalized groups who rely on federal agencies’ interpretations of decades-old laws to enforce their rights, says Mia Ives-Rublee, senior director of the Center for American Progress’ Disability Justice Initiative. \n\n“‘They’re utilizing LGBTQ issues as a wedge,’ Ives-Rublee says. ‘The attack is really about the regulatory process of the federal government, and this will impact almost every interaction that a disabled person has with the services and supports that they receive.’”\n\n“Ives-Rublee warns that the Texas suit is also part of a multifaceted attack on the power of federal agencies to interpret civil rights laws, including protections for pregnant workers and access to reproductive health care. This broad conservative effort to rip the teeth out of the administrative state was emboldened by a series of Supreme Court decisions last term, including one that ended courts’ expected deference to federal agency interpretations of vague laws.\n\n“Because the gender dysphoria lawsuit was filed in the federal district court in Lubbock, Texas, any appeal will go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, home to some of the most radically conservative decisions in recent legal history. If the 5th Circuit sides with the states in this case, it would create a conflict with the 4th Circuit decision that could force the Supreme Court, with its far-right supermajority, to weigh in. ‘I am almost 100 percent sure this is their intention,’ Ives-Rublee says.”\n",

Riley Gaines, a former swimmer turned activist, demanded that the women about to dive into that pool ‘stop participating in the farce,' while Martina Navratilova — yes, that Martina Navratilova — declared on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, that it was ‘quite frankly a mockery.’”\n\n“I came to the natatorium that day because I wanted to see the athlete who had inspired such anger for myself, and I first spotted her leaning over the edge of the pool with her arms in the water, working in the thankless but important job as a lap counter. Her teammate had fallen well behind the pace in the 1,000-meter race, but Meghan Cortez treated his arrival at the wall each lap with a rising level of encouragement.\n‘Keep going!’ Cortez shouted, her voice echoing above the din as she dipped her arms into the water to flip the counter. ‘You GOT this!’\n\n“When it was Cortez’s turn to swim, she tucked her wavy black hair under her Ramapo swim cap and stepped onto the platform. She couldn’t recover from a late start in the 200-meter intermediate medley, and after a seventh-place finish, climbed out of the pool and waited patiently to shake hands with her rivals.\nShe participated in four races that day, placing no higher than second, as Ramapo finished a distant third in the tri-meet with in-state rivals Montclair and Rowan. She chatted with parents between races, at one point giving them a better look at one of her many tattoos, and celebrated when her teammates clocked a noteworthy time.\n\n“It all seemed so utterly unremarkable, one of the thousands of sporting events that happen every day in this country that matter to the participants and no one else. This swim meet and every other competition for Ramapo this season would have been forgotten, but because of one simple fact, they became another flashpoint in our deeply divided society.\n\n“Meghan Cortez is a transgender woman.

I am an adult, and I know myself better than my state does, and I cannot stay silent about the very real harms that this law inflicts on transgender people like me.’”\n",

The foundation is the educational arm of HRC.”\n\n“Fifty-five percent of parents said their child had been bullied at school in the past year. Only 26.2 percent had a gender support plan for their child at school. However, of those who did, more than 90 percent said the support plan was very or somewhat helpful. \n\n“About one in five parents chose their child’s school or district based on policies regarding LGBTQ+ students. But about one in five also reported that their child’s school was not supportive when it came to restroom use, and a third cited lack of support for locker room use.”\n\n“And despite parental support, many trans and nonbinary children have experienced mental health challenges. Of the parents surveyed, 39.6 percent said their child had been diagnosed with depression, and 49.4 percent said the child was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Sixteen percent said their child had been hospitalized for mental health needs, and among those parents, 33 percent said it was related to their gender identity. Parents and caregivers had challenges too, with about 20 percent screening positive for moderate or severe depression.”\n\n“Children are coming out as trans or nonbinary at a young age, the survey notes. On average, parents and caregivers said their child shared their gender identity with them around 11 years old — and over half shared their identity before the age of 13.”\n",

    "selftext": "“Since Ms. Harris’s defeat, her campaign’s decision has landed in the center of a contentious debate over how large a role transgender issues played in her party’s losses around the country. Several prominent Democrats said Ms. Harris’s relative silence was a damaging concession to Mr. Trump — and evidence that the campaign was so out of step with Americans’ views that it did not appreciate the potency of the ads.\n\n“’Malpractice was committed by that campaign,’ said Ed Rendell, a Democratic former governor of Pennsylvania and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Rendell said he was so alarmed by the Trump attacks that he called top Harris campaign advisers, pleading for them to respond directly.\n\n“’They saw the ad, they knew it was being bought in heavy quantities,’ he said. ‘Where were they? What were they thinking?’”\n\n“That view has faced vocal pushback from some Democrats, particularly on the left, who warn against pinning Ms. Harris’s loss on her position on transgender rights. In a year when voters were so concerned about the economy and unhappy with President Biden, they argue, there is little hard evidence that transgender issues had a significant impact on the results.\n\n“’I never heard it anywhere on the campaign trail,’ said Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, a Democrat. Mr. Pocan said that scapegoating a small and vulnerable group was ‘the ultimate misdirection’  — and that the party instead needed to address its failure to deliver on the economic concerns of working-class voters.”\n\n“Mr. Trump’s attacks on transgender rights came from a familiar playbook. For nearly 50 years, Republicans have seized on divisive social issues that touch a nerve with the public but are often underestimated by Democrats. They typically focus on an issue that affects a small minority of Americans — but can be used to cast a candidate as out of touch.”\n\n“It is difficult to know how effective these attacks were. The issue was far from the top concern mentioned by voters in polls before Election Day: It trailed well behind the economy and immigration. In a Gallup poll, voters ranked transgender rights as the least important of 22 issues in the 2024 election. Only about 1 percent of Americans identify as transgender, according to Gallup.\n\n“But pollsters said it might have played a less obvious and still significant role: For one thing, Mr. Trump used it to reach his core base of voters, who turned out for him in strong numbers on Election Day.”\n\n“The attacks might also have had an impact on swing voters in indirect and subtle ways. Part of the Trump campaign’s aim was to portray Ms. Harris, whose election would have broken gender and racial barriers to the White House, as out of the mainstream, analysts from both parties said.\n\n“’That was the headline: That she is “other,”’ [Democratic pollster Cornell] Belcher said. ‘That entire ad says, “She is not one of us. She doesn’t share our values. She’s scary.” It’s not just transgender people: It’s all Americans who are not quote-unquote, traditional Americans.’”\n\n“For Democrats, a central question is how much these issues will be used by Republicans in future presidential campaigns — as well as whether they will prove to be effective as the issue becomes more familiar to Americans.”\n",

The story also notes Harris’ support of ‘taxpayer funding of gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners.’\n\n“The ACLU survey asked if candidates supported gender-affirming surgery for trans people who rely on state insurance — including those who are incarcerated or in immigrant detention.\n\n“Harris responded that it was important for all trans people to receive that care.”\n\n“Over the last few weeks, Trump has also spent much of his time on the campaign trail repeating false claims that children are undergoing gender-affirming surgeries at school and without parental consent — although there is no evidence of this happening anywhere.\n\n“But Trump isn’t the only Republican candidate pushing anti-trans rhetoric as a strategy to cozy up to conservative voters.”\n",

Bill Lee’s signature, Tennessee last week became the first state in the nation to establish the right of adults who claim moral or religious objections to LGBTQ identity to foster and adopt LGBTQ kids.”\n\n“In the days since the law became effective, the Department of Children’s Services (DCS) has shelved a 10-year-old policy that said children in state custody must receive care that ‘promotes dignity and respect for all children/youth and families inclusive of their gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation.’”\n\n“Tennessee currently has 8,854 kids in state custody — 6,686 of them residing in foster homes. Up to a third of all foster youth nationwide identify as LBGTQ — often kicked out of home or winding up in state custody as a result of mistreatment or rejection based on their gender identity, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“Jace Wilder, education manager Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization that has vocally opposed the law, pointed to his own tough childhood as an example of the importance of supportive adults in a child’s life.\n\n“Wilder, who is transgender, was raised, in part, by a friend’s parents after suffering abuse at the hands of his father, he said.

Department of Health and Human Services related to the placement of LGBTQI+ youth in foster care. Among the proposed rules for all foster homes is they ‘establish an environment free of hostility, mistreatment, or abuse based on the child’s LGBTQI+ status.’\n\n“In November, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti led a 17-state coalition opposing the rules, saying in a letter to the federal government that they would shrink the pool of available foster families and ‘further divert resources away from protecting foster children from physical abuse and toward enforcing compliance with controversial gender ideology.’”",

As a new psychologist, I’m proud to return to my home state and serve Kansans of all backgrounds, abilities and genders.\n\n“During my training, I studied bullying behaviors in groups of children of different ages. My team and I learned that preschoolers defined bullies as someone who ‘takes something that wasn’t theirs,’ like a toy. When researching middle schoolers, we found that bullying became more creative, like taking someone’s sense of safety through unkind words or even violence.”\n\n“On Oct. 12, The Capital Journal published an opinion piece by individuals affiliated with the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The story illustrated the important role sports play in the lives of girls and women. However, the argument for women’s equality was made at the expense of transgender and gender nonbinary individuals.\n\n“The piece, and the ADF, promotes bullying behavior by demonizing and discriminating against Kansans who don’t identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. The truth is, transgender girls don’t make sports less safe — but fear-based misinformation does.”\n\n“Supporting females in sports means making everyone’s participation a priority. Taking away someone’s sense of safety through policies and misleading editorials may empower bullies, but that fear only causes harm. We are most powerful when we uplift other Kansans, regardless of their gender identity.”\n",

Yet the jeers at Saturday’s meet were ‘a bit more severe,’ she said.\n\n“Garcia cheered and clapped for her competitors as they received their medals. When the announcer called her to the podium, the crowd fell silent and the other high school runners at the podium did not acknowledge her as they stood with hands clasped behind their backs.\n\n“As she accepted her gold medal, a voice in the crowd could be heard yelling, ‘She’s not a girl!’\n\n“Garcia expected the chilly reaction from the crowd, though she was ‘somewhat hurt’ her peers did not offer congratulations.\n\n“’I guess maybe I expected sportsmanship because I was cheering the rest of them on when they were called. So I guess I expected to get that reciprocated,’ she said. ‘But I didn’t get that.’\n\n“While the national debate continues to rage regarding the fairness of transgender participation in girls athletic competitions, Garcia said what’s lost is that the subjects of these controversies are often teenagers just trying to have fun in a sport they love.\n\n“I’m just a teenager. I wish people would remember that,’ Garcia said.”",

Susan Concannon learned that the state’s proposed gender-affirming care ban would gut mental health services for kids across the state, she knew she would have to break from her party. Concannon, a Republican who has represented Beloit and the surrounding counties in the legislature for 11 years, would have to change her vote and oppose the ban. \n\n\"Two hospitals — Stormont Vail in Topeka and Children’s Mercy in Kansas City — told Concannon and her Republican colleague Rep. Jesse Borjon that if the state banned gender-affirming care for trans youth, they would be forced to halt behavioral and mental health services for at-risk kids. The bill’s language was ambiguous enough to make the hospitals concerned that they would be held liable if they didn’t stop those services. \n\n\"Concannon had already been in conversations with parents of transgender kids, therapists, and medical providers about the harms of the bill. But she knew she could not allow mental health services for Kansas children to be cut.\"\n\n\"On April 29, Concannon and Borjon, who had both voted for the bill in March, voted against overturning Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of the proposed ban on gender-affirming care. Those two votes prevented Republicans from getting the two-thirds majority they needed to overturn Kelly’s veto. Conannon believes it was the right decision — but it has opened her up to more backlash than she expected. She’s received dozens of hate emails and text messages, primarily from people who don’t live in Kansas, alongside messages of gratitude from local clinics and hospitals.\"\n\n\"The accusations that she’s somehow harming kids have been hard for her to read. They’ve also made her think about the youth who would have been most hurt  by the legislation.\n\n“'If I’m hearing these kinds of responses from people for a week, I just can’t imagine what these kids have to deal with on a day-to-day basis,' she said.\"",

Some experts believe this is due to cases being caught at these later stages.\"\n\n\"Borowicz hopes to see more robust and longer-term research on the health of trans people, who often already struggle to access health care or otherwise have negative experiences with doctors who aren’t used to treating trans patients.\n\n\"They also called for more provider education about trans patients.\n\n“'Prostate cancer specialists need to think about all populations that may have a prostate,' said Borowicz.

She also said she had gone to the Russian Orthodox Church in the hope of finding “help and acceptance”, but faced “disgusting” treatment there instead.”\n\n“After the Russian Supreme Court deemed the “international LGBT movement” an “extremist organisation” in November, Alyoshina addressed the court asking the judges whether it was possible for her “to exist in Russian society as a trans person”, but they declined to respond.”\n\n“I’m at a point where I don’t have much to lose anymore,” Alyoshina told Novaya Gazeta Baltic. “Of course, I can force myself to become Roman,” she said, referring to her birth name, “but I’d be going against my heart”.",

The new regulations, which are slated to take effect Aug. 1, cover discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, a clause that has angered some conservatives.”\n\n“Texas will not allow Joe Biden to rewrite Title IX at whim, destroying legal protections for women in furtherance of his radical obsession with gender ideology,” Paxton said Monday in a news release announcing the lawsuit. “This attempt to subvert federal law is plainly illegal, undemocratic, and divorced from reality.”\n\n“The lawsuit, filed in the Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas, will almost certainly be heard by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who hears 95 percent of the cases filed in Amarillo. Kacsmaryk, the division’s only federal judge, has vocally opposed laws that protect LGBTQ people, including the Equality Act, which aims to make sexual orientation and gender identity protected classes.”\n\n“Kacsmaryk in 2016 — before he was appointed to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump in 2019 — filed a brief in support of the Gloucester County school board in Virginia, which had been sued by a 16-year-old transgender boy after he was denied access to the boys’ restroom at his school. The student, Gavin Grimm, argued that the school discriminated against him in violation of Title IX.”\n\nKacsmaryk in the brief, which was submitted on behalf of eight religious colleges and universities and nonprofit organizations, wrote that “the term ‘sex’ in Title IX must not be read to include gender identity.”\n\n“The Biden administration has frequently used the landmark 2020 Supreme Court ruling as a foundation on which to build policies that strengthen federal protections for transgender people. A rule finalized Friday by the Health Department that bolsters the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) prohibition of sex discrimination also relies on the decision.”\n",

[He]  detailed a plan in February 2023 to stop gender-affirming care. In August, his campaign surrogates doubled down on that plan, which includes:\n\n“Asking Congress to ‘permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these procedures,’ including via Medicare and Medicaid;\n\n“Signing an executive order instructing federal agencies to ‘cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age’;\n\n“Passing ‘a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states’;\n\n“Declaring that hospitals and other facilities providing hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries ‘will no longer meet federal health and safety standards for Medicare and Medicaid — and will be terminated from the program’;\n\n“’Protecting the rights of parents’ who won’t consent to gender-affirming care for their children;\n\n“Directing the U.S. Department of Education to inform states and school districts that they ‘will be faced with severe consequences,’ including civil rights violations, ‘if any teacher or school official suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.’”\n\n“Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to a list of questions asking for details on how his administration would adopt these proposals. But experts and providers described how it might play out.”\n\n“’What kind of coattails does he have?’ asked John Finn, a professor emeritus of government at Wesleyan University who’s studied sanctuary movements. ‘Do the Senate Republicans take control of the Senate? Do [Republicans] increase their House majority, do they stay with the precarious majority they have or do they conceivably lose? \n\n“’All of that would affect the Trump administration’s calculations about whether to proceed through federal legislation.’ A more effective approach might be through executive orders and regulations by federal agencies, he added.\n\n“Dr. Sheila Ramgopal is taking Trump’s pledge to put pressure on hospitals very seriously.\n\n“Hospitals receive a lot of federal funding, a lot of big grant money,” said Ramgopal, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and the CEO of the Allegheny Reproductive Health Center, which accepts Medicaid for a variety of gender-affirming services.\n\n“’They could even eliminate people who are paying out of pocket’ by threatening those facilities, they added.”\n\n“Dr. Andrea Fox, an internal medicine specialist. . . . believes the federal government could adopt similar legislation [to how the Hyde Amendment largely bans the use of federal funds for abortion] to ban the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care, which is offered by some [federally qualified health centers]. But she can’t imagine how it would enforce a ban on care that can include everything from hormone therapy to using a patient’s correct pronouns to ‘the kind of pictures you have hung’ around the office.   \n\n“’Who knows if they really have a plan?’ said Fox, who was the chief medical officer of a local FQHC before leaving her position this year. ‘Because they say they have a plan for doing all kinds of things, but they don’t.’”\n",

A recent Gallup poll found that voters ranked transgender issues as their lowest priority on a list that included the economy, climate change and national security.\n\n“’The election is overshadowed by corruption, authoritarianism, climate change, school shootings, the Middle East. The idea of trans rights just becomes small potatoes,’ Smith said. ‘I don’t want to say that for myself, because it’s a very important issue to me. But in the greater scheme of things for the average voter, even Republican voters, it’s just not resonating.’”\n\n“Smith said she was disappointed that Democrats hadn’t used the attack ads as an opportunity to double down on their support for transgender people and their rights. Most of the Republican ads have gone unchallenged, though in Texas, Allred responded to the Cruz ads with one of his own, claiming that he ‘does not support boys in girls sports’ — hardly the passionate support Smith and others were hoping for.”\n\n“Trump and other Republicans are 'trying to whip people into hatred and drive them to the polls,’ Smith said. ‘As a trans person, I really wish (Democrats) would at least say something to that.’”\n",

And I want to make something very clear — queer, trans and nonbinary people belong in sport,’ she said in a social media video. ‘And there is zero space in this league for hate, violence and bigotry.’\n\n“The Mariners (4-0) won a pair of home games last week against Canadian Bible College. After the first game, Mackenzie said, CBC coach Taylor Claggett yelled at a VIU staff member that Mackenzie — who led both teams with 19 points and 16 rebounds — shouldn’t be allowed to play against women.”\n\n“During the second game a day later, Mackenzie said she was physically targeted by her opponents and she later shared a video from the game where, away from the ball, a CBC player tosses her to the floor. Mackenzie finished with 14 points and four rebounds as her team won again.\n\n“’In terms of recovery, muscle mass, I’m at a competitive disadvantage,’” said Mackenzie, who said that she started transitioning when she was in kindergarten or first grade.”\n\n“’I believe all trans people should be included in sport. But it’s especially infuriating to me because I’m playing — and being forced to play — at a major biological disadvantage,’ she said. ‘I never went through a male puberty. I only went through a female puberty. And I don’t have ovaries, I don’t have testicles, so I have zero way of making any testosterone.’\n\n“Mackenzie told CP what she experienced last weekend is nothing new and that she’s been outed and attacked by players, coaches and fans across her basketball career. Last season, Mackenzie played at a college in Calgary and said the lack of support after a teammate’s transphobic comments prompted her to return home and eventually back to VIU, where she helped her team win a national championship in 2023.”\n",

He had been there for nearly eight hours, dealing with a last-minute legislative fight that no one had seen coming. At 4 p.m., a bill to aid veterans’ families by extending the window to alter death certificates had been amended to become anti-trans.\n\n“That sudden amendment had nothing to do with veterans or their families. It added a rigid definition of sex into the state’s already restrictive policy on how trans people can update their birth certificates, tying a measure harming a specific demographic to a piece of legislation meant to help people across the state. The amendment defined ‘sex’ as ‘the biological indication of male and female … without regard to an individual’s psychological, chosen, or subjective experience of gender.’”\n\n“In statehouses across the country, Republican lawmakers have been using this tactic for years. Legislation meant to benefit students, veterans and local industry has been changed on the floor, frequently at the last minute and without any chance for public comment. That’s on top of the bills that are gutted and replaced with anti-trans measures, a concerted strategy to pass anti-LGBTQ+ laws by any means necessary.\n\n“But something else is happening: As states try more extreme tactics to get anti-LGBTQ+ laws in the books, they are increasingly failing. Republican lawmakers have been refashioning state legislation meant to benefit everyone into bills that restrict the rights of a few. Increasingly, those bills are being pulled before they come up for a vote or voted down altogether.”\n",

Their gender expression made them a target and was used as a justification for their treatment by their bosses, coworkers and customers. Frequently, nonbinary people said they were passed over for raises and promotions, called slurs, and forced to work alone.”\n\n“About 3 in 5 nonbinary people have experienced discrimination or harassment at work at some point in their lives, like being fired, not hired, not promoted, or verbally, sexually or physically harassed. \n\n“About 1 in 5 nonbinary people reported physical harassment at work because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, with some survey respondents reporting being ‘assaulted,’ ‘attacked’ and ‘strangled.’”\n\n“For many nonbinary people, the worst experiences of discrimination and harassment that they face at work are linked to their multiple marginalized identities.

Chase Strangio is set to become the first out transgender lawyer to argue a case before the nation’s highest Court. \n\n“U.S. v. Skrmetti challenges a Tennessee law barring transgender youth from accessing gender-affirming-care. Strangio, co-Director for Transgender Justice with the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project, will be representing the Williams family of Nashville, two other anonymous families, and a Memphis-based medical provider to argue Tennessee’s law is unconstitutional.”\n\n“Strangio feels the weight of his responsibility—particularly given his personal connection to the subject matter of the case. ‘I have this deep, intimate and personal connection to the work that I do that can make it both harder, but also more significant, more motivating,’ he says. ‘I feel a lot of pressure, personally and on behalf of my community, to continue to figure out the best strategic decisions.’\n\n“TIME spoke with Strangio ahead of the start of the Supreme Court’s term in October. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.”\n",

The decision, which is expected by summer, stands to impact similar laws passed in half the country. \n\n“Last month, the justices at two consecutive conferences mulled whether to take up appeals from Idaho and West Virginia defending their bans on transgender girls competing on women’s school sports teams. \n\n“The justices took no action and did not relist the petitions for discussion at any of their December conferences, court dockets show, effectively placing the cases in indefinite limbo. Though the court provided no explanation, that pattern typically occurs when the justices have decided to hold a petition pending the disposition of a current case.\n\n“The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) did not object to the move.”\n\n“Both West Virginia and Idaho unsuccessfully cautioned the Supreme Court against waiting.”\n\n",

They now live independently without any financial support from relatives, working as a server earning $5.50 an hour plus tips.\n\n“’I’m living paycheck to paycheck,’ Merriss, who lives in an apartment in Cincinnati, told CNN. They manage to scrape by thanks to a housing assistance program, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\n“Merriss’ plight illustrates the harsh economic realities of millions of Americans who identify as transgender and/or non-binary. The evidence from research and surveys is unmistakable: People whose gender identity does not match their sex at birth are more likely to experience financial hardships than the general population.”\n\n“They deal with ‘lower employment rates, lower household incomes, higher rates of poverty, greater public assistance use, and increased likelihood of food insecurity,’ a 2022 study found.\"\n\n“A person’s family plays a crucial role in their financial health, economists say, even with something as simple as providing shelter in adolescence or early adulthood. That safety net is often non-existent for transgender people.\n\n“’It’s a lot about how you start out in life,” said Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. ‘We’ve found that trans people who had been kicked out of their homes or had family rejection experiences were more likely to be in an unstable economic position.’”\n\n\"Many parents also help pay for higher education. Research shows that’s simply not the case for most transgender and non-binary people. Merriss said they dream of attending college but have put that on hold to work full time.\"\n\n\"'Trans folks have been protected (at the workplace) under federal law for four years now, but it’s not clear how well that’s working,' Michael Martell, an economics professor at Bard College, told CNN. 'Trans people face stigma throughout their lives, so it’s certainly fair to say that labor market discrimination is a contributing factor to their disadvantages in life.'\"\n\n",

Trump and Republican candidates nationwide are putting transgender issues at the center of their campaigns, tapping into fears about transgender women and girls in sports and about taxpayer-funded gender transitions in prisons.\n\n“Since the beginning of August, Republicans have poured more than $65 million into television ads in more than a dozen states on these topics in some of the country’s most competitive races, according to a New York Times analysis of advertising data compiled by AdImpact.\n\n“The flood of ads in races for the House, Senate and White House inflame cultural divisions and cast Democrats as outside the mainstream. They are a sign that Republican strategists believe they have found a potent third leg for their messaging stool in 2024, along with the mainstays of inflation and immigration.\n\n“Republicans are returning to a message that was tried, mostly unsuccessfully, in the 2022 midterms, as they attempt to motivate their base and curb their losses with female voters repelled by the party’s stance on abortion.”\n\n“Up and down the ballot, Democratic candidates have mostly tried to ignore the onslaught, preferring to pivot toward more favorable policy terrain, such as abortion, rather than to be dragged into public debates on transgender issues.”\n\n“Privately, though, Democratic strategists concede that the transgender attacks are taking a toll in some races.”\n\n“Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, one of the country’s leading L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy groups, said Republican attempts to use transgender people as political tools had failed in key races in 2022 and 2023.

Although the agency says it is basing denials on pre-existing state statutes, transgender Floridians had previously been able to update their birth certificates for at least a decade. Now, they face an opaque process that seems designed to reject all applicants. \n\n“In 2023 and 2024, trans minors and adults who applied for amended birth certificates received denial letters from the state health agency’s Bureau of Vital Statistics. In those letters, reviewed by The 19th, the bureau says the paperwork that has long been accepted to update gender on birth certificates — like proof of clinical treatment and a legal name change — no longer works.”\n\n“The denial letters also offer conflicting requirements. One, from August 2023, states that for trans minors, ‘documentary evidence established prior to the child’s seventh birthday is required.’ In another letter, the bureau says that trans adults trying to update their birth certificates must provide documentation ‘established prior to the registrant’s 18th birthday.’ Many transgender adults did not know they were trans as children, or did not pursue gender-affirming care as children even if they did realize their identities — rendering either requirement difficult, if not impossible, to navigate.”\n\n“In January, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles told local officials that the state would no longer allow transgender people to update their driver’s license with their correct gender. That move was not prompted by any new law, and was simply based on a new agency policy. LGBTQ+ and legal experts believe the rule likely takes Florida out of compliance with federal law, which the state disputes.”\n",

The Sister Wives star got real on The Sarah Fraser Show, spilling the tea on the polarized reactions she receives about her transgender child, Leon Brown. And let’s just say, she’s not holding back.\n\n“For those who might not know, the Brown family catapulted to fame in 2010 with the premiere of Sister Wives on TLC. The show delves into the polygamous lifestyle of Kody Brown and his four wives—Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn—and their combined 18 children. The series has chronicled the ups and downs of their unconventional family dynamic, keeping viewers hooked for over a decade. \n\n“A few months after her spiritual marriage with Kody Brown ended, \"Sister Wives\" star Christine Brown found a new type of romance.\n\n“Leon, the only child of Meri and ex-husband Kody Brown, came out as transgender and queer in June 2022, rocking the world with their bravery and authenticity. Since then, they’ve chosen to step back from the family’s TLC show, but that hasn’t stopped people from weighing in—often harshly—on Meri’s social media.”\n",

The case considers the constitutionality of state laws that ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors. While the case itself addresses only a law from Tennessee, 26 states have passed similar laws that will be affected by the outcome.\n\n“A blanket ban on such care risks devastating effects for those youth who need it. But as the argument made clear, that is not all that is at stake. The case is also about women’s rights, and a fundamental legal principle that helped to secure them: Courts should be skeptical of laws that discriminate on the basis of sex.\n\n“With the defenders of Tennessee’s law challenging that bedrock principle, it is not only transgender equality, but sex equality more broadly that is in doubt. Depending on the outcome, Skrmetti could be the next Dobbs, adding another nail in the coffin to women’s legal freedoms — and freedoms we all enjoy regardless of sex.”\n\n“The Tennessee law — and trans discrimination more generally — is not only about discrimination against trans people, but about ensuring that we all keep in our gender lanes. As [U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth] Prelogar explained, the law here is ‘one that prohibits inconsistency with sex,’ requiring that children born as boys and girls ‘look and live like boys and girls.’ Tennessee’s argument would call into question the longstanding freedom we all enjoy to live our lives as we wish, regardless of sex.\n\n“Far from being a neutral law that applies evenhandedly to males and females, the law at issue here is of a piece with a gender hierarchy that prizes masculinity while narrowly circumscribing femininity. \n\n“Medical treatments that would reduce the fertility of trans boys and men threaten the idea of women being mothers first (and anything else second or not at all). A friend-of-the-court brief from leading conservative anti-abortion group, Alliance Defending Freedom, worried that, ‘If both a boy and a girl are considering a mastectomy, only the girl gives up the ability to breastfeed her future child.’  Scare tactics about girls renouncing maternity are part of anti-trans politics, with the cover of conservative critic Abigail Shrier’s book, Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters, showing a young girl with a blank space where her uterus would be. \n\n“These anxieties about women rejecting motherhood are the very same ones that motivate much of the opposition to abortion — and they are grounded upon the very same sex stereotypes that the equal protection clause is meant to abolish.”",

However, these ads are succeeding in a different, more harmful way: They are eroding public support for transgender Americans and their rights.\n\n\"Ground Media CEO David Rochkind told The Advocate in an interview that while the ads did not boost voter enthusiasm or mobilization for Trump, they did decrease public comfort with transgender people. 'We found that there is a decrease of 3.1 percent among those folks who say they would be comfortable accepting a close friend or family member who is transgender,' Rochkind said. He also noted a 3.7 percent decline in support for gender-affirming care for transgender youth. 'I find that incredibly damaging,' he added.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the most troubling finding from Ground Media’s study, which was released Thursday, was that the anti-trans ads reduced acceptance even among individuals who already knew a transgender person. 'We think if you just knew somebody, you would get it, you would accept, you would get over everything — these ads push back on that,' Rochkind said. This backlash among potential allies highlights how powerful and harmful the narratives in these ads can be, especially when targeting groups already leaning toward acceptance of transgender individuals.\"\n\n\"Despite the harmful social impact, the ads have yet to succeed politically. Ground Media’s randomized controlled trial, which involved nearly 2,000 people, revealed no significant increase in support for Trump. 'They’re not persuading people to vote for Trump,' Rochkind said, pointing out that the ads did not move the needle on voter choice, mobilization, or enthusiasm.\"\n",

At that point, the now notorious legislation was a novelty; the statute would force trans people to use restrooms and changing areas based on their sex assigned at birth in restaurants, cafés, gyms, and other public spaces. Republicans had introduced HB2 in response to a municipal ordinance in the relatively progressive city of Charlotte that granted trans people equal access in all areas of public accommodation—which critics alleged, without evidence, would result in predators ‘in dresses’ exploiting the rule to prey on women and children.”\n\n“It took the Republicans just 11 hours and 10 minutes to introduce, pass, and enact HB2—a speedy route to making North Carolina the first state in U.S. history to regulate public bathroom use based on trans identity.”\n\n“For a time, it seemed like. . .North Carolina would be an outlier in telling trans people where they were permitted to pee. . . The potential financial fallout, estimated to cost North Carolina $3.7 billion over 12 years, led to a compromise resulting in the law’s eventual repeal. A year after HB2’s passage, it was replaced with a law temporarily banning local municipalities like Charlotte from setting their own public accommodations laws until December 2020.”\n\n“But lest you think the bathroom bill is a thing of the past, it has recently witnessed a quiet reversal of fortune—with almost none of the public outcry that greeted HB2. . . Over the past 15 months, at least 12 states—to date—have enacted laws that bar individuals from using restrooms and locker rooms that don’t align with their ‘biological sex’ in either K-12 schools, prisons, or other buildings operated by the state government, such as museums, airports, and state parks.”\n\n“Of the bathroom bans currently in place, exactly half of them—or 6 of 12—specifically focus on regulating facility use in public schools. “\n\n“The shift in focus speaks to the larger rebranding of bathroom bills, which have piggybacked on the successful ongoing assault on the rights of trans youth and the weaponization of ‘parental rights.‘. . [T]he Bathroom Bill 2.0 has capitalized on a fallacious yet widespread panic about ‘grooming.’”\n\n“According to anti-LGBTQ+ conservatives, even basic support for trans youth, whether that’s allowing them to use the bathroom that’s most comfortable for them or respecting their pronouns, is tantamount to child abuse. By passing laws denying them those very privileges, Republican lawmakers across the country have claimed that they are actually protecting young people—that is, from the pernicious influence of liberalism.”\n\n\"Republicans are likely to keep pushing anti-trans bathroom laws in the next few years after largely maxing out on bills restricting trans youth access to gender-affirming medical care or sports participation (whereas 19 states passed gender-affirming care bans last year, just three have so far in 2024).\"\n\n\"With few other places for the anti-trans movement to go, LGBTQ+ rights groups fear that the probable expansion of bathroom bills will only increase hostility toward trans people as they go about their daily lives.\"\n",

The regulations, which do not address the more contentious issue of whether transgender athletes should be allowed on sex-separated sports teams, have already been temporarily blocked in 26 states. \n\n“With state and federal governments increasingly in conflict over the issue, it is easy to see how school and athletics administrators can feel confused when addressing the rights of transgender athletes. Being on the wrong side of the law, however, can have severe consequences for both the transgender athlete and the entire school community. The social and financial impact of such cases on a school district can be seen in R.M.A. v. Blue Springs R-IV School District, 2024 Mo. App. LEXIS 371.”\n\n“[W]hile the court may reduce the amount of attorney fees, the school district is still liable for more than $4.2 million, since the court left no doubt that the Blue Springs School District discriminated against R.M.A.\"",

Rather than going on to San Jose State for Saturday’s match, the school announced the contest is off 'due to not having enough players to compete.'\"\n\nNevada volleyball captain Sia Liilii told the Reno Gazette Journal on Oct. 15 that the team would not play San Jose State following reports there is a transgender player on the Spartans team. The woman has played at San Jose State in previous seasons, and there were no issues with her participation until right-wing activists became involved in recent months.\n\n\"Nevada initially said the school could not legally forfeit the game against San Jose State, citing state law that prohibits discrimination based on 'gender identity or expression.' But the school also said it would not punish players who did not want to play, leaving open the possibility the Wolf Pack would not have the minimum six players needed.\n\n\"San Jose State has not commented on the gender of any player on its team and has said it complies with all NCAA and Mountain West Conference policies.\"\n\n\"Nevada is the fifth school to forfeit a game against San Jose State this season, joining Southern Utah, Boise State, Wyoming and Utah State. All but Southern Utah are in the Mountain West. None of the other schools have given a specific reason, though it’s believed to be because of the possibility that San Jose State has a transgender player.

Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), who sparked a firestorm of criticism recently when he said transgender girl athletes have no place in women’s sports, insisted Democrats need to allow an open debate about how to defend against attacks from Republicans on transgender rights.\n\n“Other moderate Democrats also argue the party has become complacent — that leaders need to respond to GOP criticisms more directly and address the fact that some Democratic positions on transgender issues, including minors seeking gender-affirming treatment, do not align with the majority of the country.\n\n“The group of about a dozen moderates are particularly peeved about House leadership’s handling of GOP-pushed votes on transgender issues over the past two years, saying leaders should not have whipped against GOP-led measures like legislation banning school athletic programs from allowing transgender athletes in sports. They also say leadership should have had a clear explanation for why the party opposed those votes, one that would make sense to constituents in purple districts.”\n\n“’There is no poll result that could make me turn on marginalized people,’ said progressive Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.). ‘What I challenge us to do is find maybe better or different ways to protect folks, and better and different ways to lift up the messaging that we need that resonates with the people who need to hear and understand this message. But throwing anybody in our coalition under the bus just simply cannot be the answer.’”\n\n“Many liberals have blamed their election losses on deeper problems, like Kamala Harris’ shortened campaign and struggles to differentiate herself from President Joe Biden, as well as the demoralization of the Democratic base. They also cited advice her campaign received to adopt ‘Republican-lite’ positions, according to preliminary analysis and talking points prepared by progressive staff obtained by POLITICO.\n\n“’Harris was counseled to position herself closely with conservatives in the political establishment and a wing of the billionaire class, with limited effectiveness. Harris campaigned four times in October with Liz Cheney, more than with any other ally. She appeared with Mark Cuban more than UAW’s Shawn Fain,’ the memo stated. ‘We did not offer a meaningful contrast to Republicans celebrating billionaires and corporations — instead, the Republican-lite advice yielded no electoral benefits.’”\n\n“Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.), the first openly transgender member of Congress, had more blame for Republicans than her own party, accusing the GOP of using transgender issues to distract voters from problems that affect them more directly. She pointed out that she ‘didn’t run on my identity, but my identity was not a secret’ and she performed well in her election — though Delaware is a solidly blue state.\n\n“’Donald Trump was trying to divide and distract from the fact that he has absolutely no policy solutions for the issues that are actually keeping voters up at night,’ she added. Transgender issues are deeply personal for other House Democrats, too; some have openly transgender children or family members.”\n",

Man, have I seen a lot of these films over the years. How many terrible TV shows and documentaries and feature films and well-meaning ‘Special Reports’ have there been this century, each of them placing a vulnerable ‘Baby Trans’ in the bright light of the media before they’ve found their footing? There’s even a transgender drinking game: One shot if there’s footage of a trans woman looking wistfully into a mirror, as sad piano music plays; two shots if a right-wing ideologue is brought on (for balance, of course) to denounce ‘rapid-onset gender dysphoria’ or ‘gender ideology.’ And just drink the whole bottle if an ex-wife is shown saying something like, ‘I’m sorry, but she’s just not the man I married!’\n\n“’Will & Harper,‘ which hits Netflix and select theaters on Friday, is different. In its playfulness, and its decency, and, above all, its testimony to the transcendent power of friendship, it’s a film that is bound to open some hearts and — who knows? — maybe some minds as well.”\n",

The crowd booed. When the screen cut to a TikTok video of a drag queen, the crowd booed even louder.”\n\n“Though transgender rights are not top-of-mind issue for most, they are effective as a wedge issue for those who are still weighing their options, Republican campaign officials and political strategists said. And it is particularly effective, they argued, with culturally conservative suburban women and with some Black and Hispanic voters who may consider Harris too liberal.”\n\n“”One Fox News poll from September found that voters trusted Harris over Trump to handle transgender issues by 16 percentage points. But there are some signs that the attacks have Democrats on the defensive.\n\n“Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who faces an uphill battle to hold on to his seat in red Ohio, released an ad on Sunday in which a narrator directly rebuts a flurry of recent GOP ads that say he supports transgender athletes. Democrat Colin Allred, who is trying to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in red Texas, did the same, saying in one ad that he ‘does not support boys in girls’ sports.’”\n\n“Anat Shenker-Osorio, a Democratic strategist and messaging researcher, studied the effects of the Trump ad that accuses Harris of wanting to fund gender transition surgeries for illegal immigrants in prison, and saw that it moved about 1 percent of voters — potentially significant in an election that could be decided by just thousands of votes in a handful of states.”\n\n“In the crucial Montana Senate race, which could decide control of the chamber, Republican candidate Tim Sheehy stresses that ‘boys are boys and girls are girls’ in his stump speech, a line that may have more resonance in a red state where Republicans have battled with Montana’s first transgender lawmaker over transgender issues in the past few years.\n\n“’Donald Trump and Tim Sheehy are trying to fearmonger about what health care a small subset of Americans might be receiving and that does not resonate,’ said Montana state Rep. Zooey Zephyr, the first transgender woman elected to the Montana legislature. ‘We’ve seen this does not work.’”\n",

Legislation passed last year protects the privacy of patients accessing gender-affirming care and shields medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas.”\n\n“Minnesota’s relatively strong job market and economy are a draw for those seeking access to care, and the high cost of living for ‘shield states’ on the east or west coasts deters people from states with lower median incomes, Rohn said.”\n\n“Housing is a considerable obstacle for many transplants — the housing crisis in the Twin Cities affects everybody, but the absence of a dedicated LGBTQ+ shelter is a risk for anyone relocating without guaranteed access to housing, Charley [who requested his last name not be used] said.“\n\n“‘And you can’t sleep in your car,’ Charley said. ‘I talked to a transplant last year who was talking about doing anything to get out of Texas and mentioned in February living in a car.’”",

Horne. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of two prepubescent transgender athletes to challenge the Save Women’s Sports Act, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2022.”\n\n“At one point, there were at least two: the pair of students involved in the lawsuit. The two trans girls were 11 and 15 years old when the suit was filed in April 2023. They have identified as girls since they were 5 and 7 years old, respectively, and were on puberty-blocking medication after being diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to court documents. The 11-year-old had been playing girls’ soccer and basketball with no objections from her school. The 15-year-old was a member of her school’s girls’ volleyball team but was barred from competing due to the law.\n\n“Though Republican lawmakers claimed in their statement that ‘boys have physiological advantages over girls’ even before puberty hits, federal judge Jennifer Zipps disagreed when granting a preliminary injunction against the law last year. ‘Transgender girls who receive puberty-blocking medication do not have an athletic advantage over other girls,’ she ruled. Additionally, the three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the Save Women’s Sports Act doesn’t prevent transgender men from playing in men’s sports and targets only transgender women.” \n\n“Whether the U.S. Supreme Court agrees to consider the Arizona law remains to be seen. The high court receives more than 7,000 cases a year and only accepts 100 to 150 of them, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n\n“But if the court does take up the question, the Republicans defending the law have some homework to do. Before decrying the threat transgender athletes represent to girls’ sports, they might want to figure out how many such athletes there really are.”\n",

Under the Tennessee law that is now being challenged before the Supreme Court, they are barred from doing so to allow an adolescent to identify, live or appear in a way inconsistent with the person’s sex assigned at birth.\n\n“The question before the court is whether a law that prohibits such medical treatment is discriminatory under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Our position, and the position of the United States (at least until Jan. 20), is that it does.\n\n“ My presence at the Supreme Court as a transgender lawyer will have been possible because I have had access to the very medical treatment at the center of the case. Though some doubt the lifesaving properties of this care, I know them personally. And so do my clients.”",

I was a teenager once; I know it’s a tough spot,’ Holahan told WGAL. ‘But I also think windows aren’t a solution. I think if it was a real issue, it wouldn’t just be gender-inclusive restrooms.’”\n\n“The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania condemned the installation of the window, calling it ‘discriminatory.’”\n",

The Cowgirls also played against the Spartans last year, though Fleming did not participate.\n\n“University of Wyoming spokesman Chad Baldwin did not offer a comment when asked Wednesday why the Cowgirls, after participating in games involving Fleming in 2022, changed course this year. When the university announced Tuesday that it was forfeiting the game against San José, it did not offer an explanation.”\n\n“For some, the controversy involves the safety of UW’s Cowgirls. Fleming can spike the ball at an estimated 80 miles an hour, according to a lawsuit her teammate Brooke Slusser joined against the NCAA over allowing trans athletes.\n\n“If true, the claim would place Fleming among the world record holders, which are currently held by athletes out of college. The women’s world record is around 70 miles an hour, while the fastest spike recorded for men in the Volleyball Nations League was about 84 miles per hour. \n\n“Fleming’s stats show she didn’t compete against Wyoming in 2023. Fleming was a leader for kills in both games against UW in 2022, though she had fewer kills than teammate Amethyst Harper in Laramie. UW lost both games 1-3.”\n\n“In response to UW’s decision Tuesday, San José State University released its own statement saying, ‘It is disappointing that our SJSU student athletes, who are in full compliance with NCAA and Mountain West rules and regulations, are being denied opportunities to compete.’\n\n“’We are committed to supporting our student-athletes through these challenges and in their ability to compete in an inclusive, fair, safe and respectful environment.’\n\n“San José State is scheduled to play Colorado State University on Thursday evening in Fort Collins, which will serve as the annual inclusive excellence game.\n\n“’This game is a collaboration between the Office of Inclusive Excellence and Athletics, with a special highlight on DEI efforts and history in the world of volleyball,’ according to CSU’s website.”\n",

President Trump is for you’ — Democrats are now debating how much the issue of trans rights hurt them and how fast they should retreat from it. Which is remarkable, because throughout her brief campaign, Kamala Harris was all but silent on the subject. It’s not clear how much further Democrats could actually retreat.”\n\n“The party’s decision to focus on the issues that matter to most voters, especially reproductive rights, and set trans rights aside is based on a misconception. The two issues can’t be separated, because trans rights don’t just resemble reproductive rights; trans rights *are* reproductive rights.”\n\n“Trump’s and Vance’s politics are coherent, and their legislative agenda is clear: Roll back trans rights, lesbian and gay rights, reproductive rights and women’s rights, all in the name of making America great, straight and white again. It’s entirely possible that Harris’s evasions on the issue of trans rights helped cost her the trust of voters, and by extension the election. But the price trans Americans will likely pay if we are abandoned by the Democratic Party as a small and unpopular constituency may be much higher.”\n\n",

We’re there for each other, win or lose,’ she said in a statement. ‘Not being allowed to play on my team with the other girls would disconnect me from so many of my friends and make school so much harder.’\n\n“The suit says both girls have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, feelings of distress due to a mismatch between their birth sex and their gender identity. Both have been taking puberty-blocking medication to prevent bodily changes such as muscle development, facial hair growth or a deepening voice that might add to that distress.\n\n“The lawsuit claims the New Hampshire law violates constitutional protections and federal laws because the teens are being denied equal educational opportunities and are being discriminated against because they are transgender.”\n\n“Turmelle is entering her first year of high school at Pembroke Academy and says she’s looking forward to trying out for both the tennis and track and field teams.\n\n“’I’m a transgender girl, I’ve known that my whole life and everyone knows I’m a girl,’ she said in a statement. ‘I don’t understand why I shouldn’t get to have the same opportunities as other girls at school.’”\n",

Officers noted that the victim’s eye was bruised and swollen. \n\n“Witnesses corroborated the account, and one of the suspects, Michael Boykin, fled the scene but was later linked to the incident.\nA security officer familiar with Boykin reported that he has a history of physically assaulting members of the transgender community in the area.

    "selftext": "\"For Lizette Trujillo, there were multiple reasons it was worth making the 2,000 mile-trip from Tucson, Ariz. to the nation’s capital for the Gender Liberation March to fight for bodily autonomy. \n\n“'It's really important because, yes, I'm the mother of a transgender child, but I [also] had an abortion at 22, had a miscarriage at 40. Having bodily autonomy and access to care that is widely necessary for you is really, really important,' says Trujillo, 44. 'And the thought of my child, my son, not having access to the care that's necessary for him, is something that is terrifying.'\n\n\"Trujillo is one of some 2,000 people who gathered in Washington, D.C. on Saturday in a march uniting activists for both abortion rights and transgender rights. The march comes as more than 650 anti-trans bills have been introduced across local legislatures in 2024, according to the trans legislation tracker, and amid a recorded rise in anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes. At the same time, abortion rights have been curtailed in multiple states since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Some 14 states currently have a total abortion ban in place, and the issue is set to be on the ballot in 10 states come November.\"\n\n\"For the organizers of the march, linking the two issues was an intentional strategy.\n 'The idea was to bring together the energy stoked in the fight for abortion access and reproductive justice after the Dobbs [v. Jackson Women’s Health] decision, and also the energy put into fighting for queer and trans folks who are facing attacks on access to health care,' Raquel Willis, a transgender activist and co-organizer of the march, told TIME in an interview ahead of the march. \n\n\"Eliel Cruz, a co-organizer, argues limiting access to abortion and gender-affirming care are part of a larger connected push to reinforce gender binaries and discriminate against people based on their identity.\"",

The trend of describing yourself as ‘very demure’ has been so astronomical that celebrities like Lady Gaga, Penn Badgley and even the President of the United States, Joe Biden, have used it! \n\n“Within a week of posting her first ‘demure’ video, Jools amassed over 100 million likes across social media.

This virality has been life changing for Jools. ‘One day, I was playing cashier and making videos on my break, and now I’m flying across countries to host events, and I’m gonna be able to finance the rest of my transition,’ Jools said in a recent TikTok video. \n\n“Jools, a transgender Latina, being able to now finance her transition is huge news for someone like her.

It’s already happened. Algerian boxer Imane Khelif was terrorized at the Paris Olympics. After South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said at the Final Four that she has no problem with transgender female athletes, the cesspool that is the right-wing internet combed through the Gamecocks roster and theorized about who might be transgender.”\n\n“Worse than these modern-day inquisitions are the resolution of them.

Wade, eliminating the federal right to an abortion, Mike Bonanza launched Elevated Access.\n\n“As the need has grown, so has Elevated Access. The organization has continued to enlist volunteer pilots and offer free flights to patients who need reproductive health care, such as abortions and gender-affirming care, but who don’t have access to it where they live, whether due to bans or lack of resources. Elevated Access completed 400 flights in its first 18 months, according to Bonanza. In the past 12 months, it’s made that total 1,200.\n\n“Now, Bonanza and his few staff members are preparing for the results of the November elections, which could have an impact on their work. For Bonanza, there is a ‘best-case’ scenario that sees Vice President Kamala Harris ascend to the presidency, and a ‘worst-case’ that sees former President Donald Trump return to office.”\n\n“’Trump winning alone doesn't necessarily do all the bad things that could happen. Harris winning doesn't mean all the good things will happen,’ Bonanza said. ‘So, a likely scenario really is some form of what we see today, where it's going to vary wildly between states no matter who wins, at least for probably the first year to 18 months [of the next administration].’”\n\n“Bonanza isn’t quite sure what will happen to Elevated Access in the longshot event of a national ban. While the organization currently enlists its volunteer pilots and other allies through aviation conferences and media coverage, their efforts have remained domestic. He insists that if abortion is somehow outlawed nationally or otherwise restricted, his group will continue to do what they’ve done in the face of increasing state bans, which is ‘get creative.’”\n\n“Even under Harris, Bonanza explained that ‘there's always going to be people that don't have transportation, don't have the funds they need to pay for the care they need, don't have housing and other things they might need in order to get care from the right provider.’ Part of this is due to ‘the state of the American health care system’ and lack of universal health care, but ‘that's not something we're gonna fix in the next two to four or even eight years — it's going to be a long process.’”\n\n“[E]ven if President Harris is able to [legally protect] abortion, gender-affirming care, and all the possible scenarios that we would support, legalization does not equal access.’”\n\n“Beyond the election, Elevated Access is preparing for the U.S. Supreme Court’s impending ruling on gender-affirming care and the constitutionality of state restrictions for youth. Bonanza, who is not just the executive director but also a pilot, has personally flown both transgender adults and youth to receive treatment.”\n",

Later, they joined in, showcasing their own style.”\n\n“Inter-LGBT President James Leperlier was more circumspect, arguing that France still has significant strides to make in inclusivity.\n\n“’We know in the LGBTQ community in France we are far from what the ceremony showed. There’s much progress to do in society regarding transgender people. It’s terrible that to legally change their identity they are forced to be on trial,’ Leperlier said.\n\n“He also highlighted the disparity in acceptance, saying that the community is not visible in other official ceremonies and “has difficulty being heard.’\n\n“’If you saw the opening ceremony last night you’d think it was like that normally, but it’s not.

In early August, they will be joined by US 1,500-meter runner Nikki Hiltz, who qualified for the Games in spectacular fashion, bursting past the leaders of the pack in the final stretch of the race.”\n\n“Now Hiltz will be running for their community in the Olympics, and very much against the grain when one considers the retrograde approach that the transphobic World Athletics, the global governing body for track and field, has taken when it comes to trans participation. \n\n“In March 2023, it issued new guidelines that, in essence, banned transgender women athletes from participating in World Athletics events: The group ‘agreed to exclude male-to-female transgender athletes who have been through male puberty.’”\n\n“World Athletics is headed by former Olympian and International Olympic Committee member Sebastian Coe, who emphasized the desire to assure ‘the integrity of the female category in athletics’ and stated, ‘We will be guided in this by the science around physical performance and male advantage which will inevitably develop over the coming years.’ \n\n“Implicit in his official statement was a two-prong admission: (1) This policy targeted trans women, and (2) there is currently no scientific consensus—rooted in systematic, independent research—that justifies the exclusion of trans athletes. It’s just a vibes thing.\n\n“What about the International Olympic Committee? Back in 2021, months after trans athlete Laurel Hubbard represented New Zealand in weightlifting—and the world kept on chugging along—the IOC issued a ‘framework on fairness and non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex variations’ that, on its surface, sounded promising.”\n\n“But then, cowering behind a wall of nice-sounding words, the IOC did not defend or protect transgender athletes. The self-proclaimed ‘supreme authority’ of the Olympics punted responsibility to international sports federations to craft their own policies. That’s exactly what the federations did, starting with swimming and athletics, which developed policies that violated the spirit of the IOC’s statement. Neither policy is rooted in independent science research. This bastion of ill-conceived chicanery explains why we will see no trans women athletes at the Paris Olympics, or any Olympics for the foreseeable future.”\n",

    "selftext": "“On December 4, 2024, the US Supreme Court will hear United States v Skrmetti. The case raises the question of whether a state law that prohibits medically necessary gender-affirming care for transgender people violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection guarantee, which bars discrimination based on sex.\n\n“Skrmetti arrives five years after Bostock v Clayton County, Georgia, which addressed Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (the act). The act, among other prohibitions, bars employment discrimination based on ‘sex.’ Bostock held that the act’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination prohibits discriminatory conduct based on transgender identity or sexual orientation. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which oversees and enforces Title VII, has extended Bostock’s holding to the terms and conditions of employment more generally, including employee health benefits.\n\n“The question effectively on the table in Skrmetti is whether Bostock’s definition of ‘sex’ applies in a 14th Amendment equal protection context and therefore prohibits state laws that discriminate against transgender people where medically necessary gender-affirming health care is concerned. If the Bostock definition applies (and logic would seem to dictate ‘yes’), then state transgender health care bans would lose the automatic legal presumption that state laws regulating health care normally enjoy. Instead, a state seeking to maintain such a law would carry the heavy burden of proving that its ban in fact furthers an important governmental interest and does so by means that are substantially related to that interest.”\n\n“Should the US prevail, it does not necessarily follow that Tennessee’s law would be overturned. Indeed, a more likely result might be that the Court clarifies the proper standard of review in challenges to state transgender health care laws and remands the case back to the lower courts for a full trial on the merits of the state’s claim. Its decision presumably would apply to all pending state transgender care ban cases, some of which display blatant evidence of animus toward transgender people. A Court ruling in favor of the US would likely also have important implications for the pending Section 1557 cases, since the definition of sex discrimination in a constitutional context inevitably would color how a civil rights statute would necessarily be interpreted.”\n",

There isn’t conclusive information as to Clark’s pronoun use, so HRC used they/them pronouns. Clark had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and was taking female hormones.\n\n“Clark died April 2, shortly after prison officials broke up the fight between Clark and the other inmates, according to The Shreveport-Bossier City Advocate (no relation to this publication), a newspaper in Louisiana. The Louisiana Department of Corrections declined to give the paper any details about the fight, beyond saying an investigation is ongoing and there may be criminal charges against some prisoners.”\n\n“Clark’s trans identity made them vulnerable in prison, Terrance Winn, who served time with them at Angola and is now an activist for criminal justice reform, told the Louisiana paper.”\n\n“Trans prisoners are five times more likely than cisgender inmates to be sexually assaulted by prison staffers and more than nine times more likely to be sexually assaulted by fellow inmates, according to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey. Other studies have shown harsh conditions for trans inmates as well.\n\n“’Yella was finally living their truth — something that everyone deserves to do, no matter their circumstances,’ Tori Cooper, director of community engagement for HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative, said in the press release. ‘Yet the circumstances of their death, and the harassment and violence faced while incarcerated, show that the system failed them as it does far too often for trans and gender-expansive people.’”",

Your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation. The school decides what’s gonna happen with your child.

It’s a string of whistle stops in Trump’s fantasyland.”\n\n“What makes this performance, which would render anyone in a normal election cycle unelectable, more demoralizing is the reaction of the press. It was pretty much: Nothing.\n\n“As far as I can tell, none of the major newspapers, nor CNN nor MSNBC, quoted his words or even paid them much attention.\n\n“The New York Times mentioned that the group’s event featured a panel discussion titled ‘Moms Know Best: Protecting Kids from Secret Gender Transitions in Schools’ and noted that Trump repeated the inaccurate assertion that an Algerian athlete who won an Olympic gold as a female boxer was a man, which has been disproved.\n\n“Of the rest of it, not a word.\n\n“Nothing that I could find in the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post and The Times published similar Associated Press dispatches from the Friday event. Neither mentioned the lines about schoolchildren kidnapped and given surgeries against their will.”\n\n“Within the journalism community, a debate is raging over whether and how the big news organizations should highlight Trump’s mental condition.

In one appeal that has been pending at the Supreme Court for months, a group of Wisconsin parents say their school district is violating parental rights by hiding transgender support plans – allowing students to change their pronouns and bathroom use without informing parents. Anti-abortion groups, meanwhile, have for years argued that parents must have a say in a minor’s decision to end a pregnancy.”\n",

The law clarifies that Illinois judges can instead issue the documentation necessary for the change.”\n\n“The change also allows foreign-born, transgender Illinois residents to circumvent documentation rules in their regions of birth that may not be as amenable to gender changes.

Reeves halts enforcement of changes to Title IX — the federal civil rights law preventing sex discrimination in schools and education programs that receive government funding — that were finalized in April by the Education Department in Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.”\n\n“The new rule, which covers discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity for the first time, had been set to take effect later this summer.” \n\n“Reeves, a President George W. Bush appointee, wrote in his ruling that the plaintiffs — the six GOP-led states, an association of Christian educators and a 15-year-old girl — will “suffer immediate and irreparable harm” if the rule is allowed to take effect.” \n\n“As [the plaintiffs] correctly argue, the new rule contravenes the plain text of Title IX by redefining ‘sex’ to include gender identity, violates government employees’ First Amendment rights, and is the result of arbitrary and capricious rulemaking,” Reeves wrote.”\n\n“His ruling comes days after another federal judge temporarily blocked the administration’s rule from taking effect in Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana, after the states sued the Biden administration in April. Lawsuits challenging the rule in more than a dozen other Republican-controlled states are still pending.” \n\n“Although Title IX is a federal law, each administration takes a different approach to enforcing its regulations, which schools are then required to follow as a condition of receiving funding from the government.” ",

Just 13 companies received a perfect score in 2002. By last year, 545 businesses did even though the requirements have expanded.”\n\n“Emboldened by a Supreme Court decision last year that declared race-based affirmative action programs in college admissions unconstitutional, conservative groups have won lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations. They’re now targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups, and widening their objections to include programs focused on gender identity.”\n\n“Dozens of legal cases have been filed against employers for DEI initiatives, including complaints that target hiring practices, employee resource groups or mentorship programs that plaintiffs say prioritize people of certain races or sexual identities while excluding others.\n\n“Most American companies launched a review of their DEI programs last summer in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard, said Jason Schwartz, co-chair of the labor and employment practice group at Gibson Dunn, a law firm that has helped more than 50 major corporations audit their DEI programs.\n\n“’The opponents to these efforts are winning the war of words, and they’ve got a lot of momentum in the courtroom, so I do think it’s a serious threat that needs to be responded to in a thoughtful way,’ Schwartz said.\n\n“But there’s also a flip side. Companies built DEI anti-harassment programs in part to mitigate potential legal risks that come with a toxic workplace, and ‘abandoning these programs in fact opens them up to risk down the road if employees feel discrimination or harassment,’ said Eric Bloem, vice president at the Human Rights Campaign.”\n",

Dan Sullivan (R), who introduced Arkansas Act 372, said at the time that the law protects children and doesn’t harm librarians unless they’re doing something awful.”\n\n“But others say bills like Sullivan’s are ideologically driven censorship cloaked as concern for children, noting that as book challenges spiked to historic highs over the past two years, the majority of objections targeted books by and about LGBTQ people and people of color, including ‘All Boys Aren’t Blue’ by George M. Johnson and ‘Gender Queer’ by Maia Kobabe.”",

She spoke to reporters after a loss to Colorado State on Oct. 3 but would not discuss the suit. Attempts to reach Slusser’s attorney listed in the filing papers, William Bock, did not get a response. The Chronicle tried to contact several of Slusser’s former teammates and coaches, but none answered.”\n\n“To try to better understand Slusser’s actions, the Chronicle reviewed her court filing, her recent media appearances and social media posts by her and people close to her.”\n",

With substantial financial backing from a conservative network led by conservative legal operative Leonard Leo, the group has focused on opposing gender-affirming care, posing a significant threat to the LGBTQ+ community. But what is the group really up to?\n\n\"Leo, a key figure in the conservative legal movement, is known for his instrumental role in shaping the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority. According to ProPublica, Leo built the machine that remade the American legal system, advising former President Donald Trump on the nominations of now-justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. He previously helped pick or confirm the court’s three other conservative justices: Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito. Leo’s influence extends beyond the judiciary, as he now channels considerable resources into various conservative causes, including Do No Harm.\n\n\"Leo’s machine extended to influencing state-level judicial appointments and elections, utilizing groups like the Judicial Crisis Network to fund campaigns and advertisements supporting conservative candidates. This meticulous planning ensured a pipeline of conservative judges who shared Leo’s ideological commitments, significantly altering the judicial landscape in the United States, ProPublica reports.\"\n\n\"The rise of Do No Harm represents a new chapter in the conservative movement’s ongoing efforts to influence American politics and policy. An Accountable for Equality staffer emphasized that Leo’s involvement in this anti-transgender agenda is particularly alarming, as it weaponizes health care decisions that should remain between patients and their doctors.\"",

The school suspended him for a day when administrators later caught him using the boys restroom, and the principal warned that the punishment could escalate to expulsion if he did it again, according to the suit.\n\n“’I am bringing this lawsuit because rules like this are damaging to kids’ mental, physical and emotional health,’ Doe said in a statement provided by his attorney. \n\n“A provision in the state budget passed in June stipulated that public schools would lose 25% of their state funding if they permit students to use single-sex restrooms and locker rooms that do not align with their biological sex. The South Carolina budget rule conflicts with a federal regulation issued by the Biden administration under Title IX, the gender equity law, that requires schools to allow students to use the restrooms or locker rooms that align with their gender identities.\n\n“’At the end of the day, they have to follow the law,’ said Alexandra Brodsky, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Public Justice, which is representing Doe. ‘And the law says that trans students get to equally enjoy their education as their cisgender peers.’”\n",

The proposal would limit membership to ‘any male defined as a human being naturally born male, who remains and continually identifies as male,’ according to exclusive reporting by GLAAD.  \n\n“But on Tuesday, David Johns, NBJC CEO and executive director, called the proposal discriminatory, adding that it infringes upon basic human rights. \n\n“’These proposals starkly contradict the historical commitment to equality, justice, and the advancement of all Black people,’ Johns said. ‘By seeking to exclude transgender people, these fraternities are turning their backs on the very principles of brotherhood and inclusivity that they were founded upon and are a betrayal of the legacy of activism and leadership that these organizations have upheld for over a century.’\n\n“Alpha Phi Alpha would not be the first Black fraternity to pass such a proposal. In 2017, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc. decided to identify as ‘an exclusively male organization’ and limits its membership accordingly.”\n",

There was no new groundbreaking research study that came out — nothing has changed,’ they say. ‘If anything, the care has become more standardized, more guideline-based.’”\n\n“Erin Reed, a transgender journalist and activist, has closely tracked these laws as they made their way through state legislatures.\n\n“’I have watched thousands of hours of legislative hearings on this — there is probably not another topic that is currently receiving as much legislative time in the United States right now in statehouses across the country,’ she says.”\n\n“It’s also not coming from a groundswell of public concern, she asserts. . . . point[ing] to a NORC-LA Times poll released in June that found 77% of Americans agreed with the statement: ‘Elected officials are mostly using debates over transgender and nonbinary people to distract attention from more pressing priorities.’\n\n“There’s also a religious aspect to the push for these laws. ‘When God created us, he created us male and female, and that's it — there is no other choice,’ South Carolina House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, a Republican, told reporters in January. ‘All these other folks that want to change that from birth or change that through their life, we need to stand up against that.’”\n",

And has since dropped $65 million of anti-trans dialing up the volume on this issue.”\n\n“No child receives surgery at school to change their gender. More to the point, gender affirming care for minors is an incredibly complex and highly standardized process involving parents and doctors that rarely even involves surgery at all.\n\n“The reason that this lie about kids has become a talking point in the general election is because of a long-standing coordinated right-wing effort to spread vast quantities of medical misinformation about transgender people and make the debate over ‘gender ideology‘ a mainstream topic.”\n\n“Starting in 2021, after Joe Biden defeated Trump for the presidency, there was an explosion of anti-trans legislation introduced and passed in states across the country. These laws have become increasingly targeted and expansive—moving from policing transgender youth to transgender adults—and designed to push trans people to the margins of all aspects of society.”\n\n“The reason we've seen this dramatic uptick in both the scale and scope of anti-trans bills is because being anti-trans has now become a core pillar of the Republican Party political platform, and a litmus test for simply being a member of the GOP.”\n",

Texans had previously been able to change the listed sex by presenting the agency with an order from a judge. Now, drivers will not be able to change the sex on their licenses unless it is to fix a clerical error.”\n\n“In an attempt to learn more about how and why the change was made, The Texas Newsroom requested all the messages sent to the new internal email.\n\n“In response, the agency released more than 700 pages of emails.\n\n“It appears just one of the emails was an internal communication noting an employee had received a request to change the sex listed on a driver’s license. The rest, more than 80 messages, were from people critical of the policy change, including hundreds of pages of what look like spam.”\n\n“Johnathan Gooch, a spokesperson for the LGBTQ rights group Equality Texas, said members of the queer community online came up with the idea of spamming the agency after The Texas Newsroom broke the story about the policy change on August 21. While the email address itself was not published, and it was clearly meant for internal use only, screenshots of an agency message that included the address were shared online.”\n\n“It’s unclear whether the amount of spam the agency received affected its ability to track the new policy change.\n\n“The records show that in the days following the policy change, the Department of Public Safety was signed up for PETA’s newsletter and emails from the Krazy Coupon Lady. The address received emails from QueerMeNow, a gay pornography blog, and Lovehoney, a British company that sells adult toys and lingerie.”\n\n“Someone requested a quote to ship a 2024 Bentley Eight from Columbus, Ohio, to Huntsville, Alabama, from a logistics company. According to the company’s CEO, the requestor provided a number with a Florida area code and a familiar name: Greg Abbott.\n\n“A half dozen emails were just copies of the Bee Movie script.\n\n“One email read: ‘oh no someone is spamming your gestapo list wow.’”\n",

JD Vance, R-Ohio, as his vice presidential running mate Monday, sparking near-immediate backlash from some of the country’s largest LGBTQ advocacy groups, who called attention to his support for policies and rhetoric targeting the community.\n\n“Both the Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ rights organization, and GLAAD, a national LGBTQ media advocacy group, released lists of comments Vance had made and policies he had supported relevant to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. \n\n“HRC and GLAAD noted that Vance introduced a bill last year called the Protect Children’s Innocence Act, which would have banned transition-related medical care, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and operations, for minors nationally. The bill, which was never taken up in committee, would have charged health care providers who violated it with a class C felony, which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and also would have banned institutions of higher education and accrediting entities from providing instruction about gender-affirming care.”\n\n“During his Senate campaign in July 2022, Vance told Mission America, a right-wing Christian organization based in Ohio, that he would oppose the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill to ensure federal marriage protections for same-sex and interracial marriages. Congress passed the legislation in fall 2022, and President Joe Biden signed it in December, before Vance was sworn in in January 2023.”\n\n“Vance has also echoed false tropes increasingly used by conservatives to describe LGBTQ people and those who support them as ‘groomers.’”\n\n“Some gay conservatives voiced support for Vance. Log Cabin Republicans, the country’s largest organization representing LGBTQ conservatives and straight allies, praised him as an ‘incredible pick’ on social media.\"\n",

After all, isn’t conflict the lifeblood of political journalism? Aren’t culture-war issues the catnip of cable news?\n\n“Apparently not when it comes to anti-trans rhetoric.\n\n“While explicitly LGBTQ and progressive outlets were sounding the alarm, running stories with headlines like ‘Marjorie Taylor Greene and other Republicans attack transgender rights on RNC opening night’ and ‘Marjorie Taylor Greene launches attack on trans people at Republican National Convention,’ mainstream media outlets seemed to be reporting from an alternate universe.\n\n“Major newspapers and network news programs focused on the expected narratives: the horse race, the spectacle, talks of ‘unity,’ and the occasional policy mention. They dissected the stagecraft, analyzed the crowd reactions, and speculated about election strategies. But the persistent drumbeat of anti-trans messaging? Crickets.”\n\n“As we move forward in this election cycle, it’s crucial to hold not just politicians accountable for their words and actions but also the media for their selective hearing and reporting.

The 38-year-old Texas resident was in the midst of applying for a gender marker update—a process he started in May—when a new Texas policy barring transgender people from changing their gender markers on their state IDs went into effect on Aug. 20.  \n\n“The change, which was quietly made by the Texas Department of Public Safety without any notice, has left many in the trans community in Texas confused and frustrated. ‘It made me… disappointed in society,’ says Hervey, who was hoping to obtain a court order from a Texas judge to present to the Department of Public Safety, as per the previous gender marker update policy. ‘I don't understand [how] a person's gender affects the next person.’ Hervey says that during his virtual court hearing on Aug. 23, the judge advised him to put his pursuit of a gender marker update on pause, calling it ‘dangerous’ and saying that she wasn't sure what the state was going to do with the data it is gathering on people seeking these changes.\n\n“Trans Texans aren’t the only ones without recourse to get a government ID that matches their gender identity; Texas is one of a number of states that have or are considering similar policies. The ACLU legislative tracker found at least 16 bills introduced this legislative year in states from Florida to Iowa that would bar access for trans people to get IDs that match their gender identity.”\n\n“Proponents of the policies say state IDs should only reflect a person’s sex at birth, and have sought to remove nonbinary as a possible gender marker. But IDs are essential for transgender people to feel safe in everyday lives, advocates say. ‘We use our IDs for everything—to vote, to open a bank account—and having an ID that matches who you are is just so simple,’ says Johnathan Gooch, director of communications at Equality Texas. ​​This year the stakes could be particularly high: Joelle Bayaa-Uzuri Espeut, director at The Normal Anomaly Initiative, a Black LGBTQ+ nonprofit, says she’s concerned about transgender Texans being comfortable voting with their IDs in November.”\n\n“In Texas last week, the state stopped letting trans people update their gender markers on their birth certificates by modifying the birth certificate correction form, the Transgender Education Network of Texas first reported. The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed to TIME that it is no longer changing sex on birth or death certificates based on court orders due to ‘recent public reports have highlighted concerns about the validity of court orders purporting to amend sex for purposes of state-issued documents.’\n\n“Under the new gender marker update directive, the Department of Public Safety asked employees to send requests for gender marker updates to a specific email, according to an internal email obtained by KUT News, stoking concerns about the possible creation of a database of transgender people.”\n\n“’The surveillance is especially alarming because there was no notice of it,’ says Gooch. ‘So people who were already moving through the process to update their gender markers were involuntarily subsumed into this surveillance project by the Attorney General, having their birth certificates or whatever primary documents they were using to update their gender marker along with their court order and their driver's license, scanned and sent to this email address.’”\n",

Dodie Horton, R-Haugton, which limits discussion of gender and sexuality in public schools, to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign it into law. It passed on a 28-7 vote, with Democratic Sens. Katrina Jackson-Andrews of Monroe and Regina Barrow of Baton Rouge joining Republicans in support of the bill.”\n\n“Horton’s bill restricts discussion of gender and sexuality in schools, except for topics in approved curricula. This would allow discussion of a romantic relationship in a book but not mentions of a teacher’s family, for example.”\n\n“The measure is similar to a Florida law referred to by critics as a ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill. Horton’s proposal is much broader and would apply to K-12 grades, whereas Florida’s law applies only to early-grade students. \n\n“Florida recently settled a lawsuit over the law filed by civil rights activists. As part of the agreement, students and teachers are permitted to discuss gender and sexuality as long as it is not part of classroom instruction.”\n\n“Horton’s bill would not just apply to classroom instruction. It also prohibits ‘covering the topics of sexual orientation or gender identity’ during any extracurricular and athletics events, meaning it could potentially hinder student chapters of the Gay-Straight Alliance and other LGBTQ+ student organizations.”\n\n“A separate proposal, House Bill 121 by Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, is slated to be discussed by the Senate next week. It prohibits the use of transgender and nonbinary youth’s chosen names and pronouns in public K-12 schools without parental permission.”",
