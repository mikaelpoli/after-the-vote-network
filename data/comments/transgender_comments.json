There are plenty of trans folks who didn't transition until they were adults, but they were still trans kids, they were just closeted trans kids. \n\nDefining \"trans youth\" as only those that are fortunate enough to have supportive parents does not serve our interests. Once we expand that definition, we can expand the discussion to all the harm that so many cis people have already done to so many of us--for decades--by forcing us to wait until we were adults to transition. \n\nI was a trans youth. I did not have supportive parents. I was not able to transition until I was an adult. That did irreparable harm to me."

    "comment_body": "It's horribly ironic that a nation that makes so much noise on the theme of keeping children safe is actually responsible for such a lack of safety for children, and not just for trans kids in the US, but for so many children in so many parts of the world. This is a legacy of the lack of outrage following Madeline Albright's statement that the death of 500,000 Iraqi children as a consequence of US imposed medicine embargo was worth it.\n\nI was horrified, back than, at the lack of public response to that, as I still am. It seemed then, and now, to be a result of the fact that both of the only two parties are equally invested in maintaining their prominence, so that the sins of either one end up being glossed over, because the only alternative, ever, is the opposition.\n\nIt simply cannot be true that in a nation of at least 350.000,000 people, all of their interests are served by two parties, and there is a history of both of those parties working to prevent the influence of any other.\n\nRight now, the fact that this faux dualism is not enough to assure the rights of all citizens is made blatantly obvious by the lack of compassion on both sides for any of those whose lives do not fit the bland ideal American that suits the bland PR objectives of either party.\n\nThe fetishistic glorification of individuals at the front of political campaigns as saviors of the nation only ever lasts as long as it takes to get over the win or the loss of an election, and yet, due to the binary dualism of the system as it exists, resentments are never fully set aside for the sake of moving on and are instead invested in regressive argumentation on the merits of the one or the other at the expense of focusing on the fact that neither of the two parties are invested in anything other than the maintenance of their own institutional existence and the benefits they accrue.\n\nHow can anyone forgive the silence of the Democrats in the face of what is always being done to the minority communities in the country, simply on the basis that they are not the authors of the consistent Republican pogroms against minority communities, whether it's those who have no other choice than to live on welfare payments, whether it's immigrants or whether, as now. it's trans people? The bottom line is that both parties are failing everyone in the nation, both in current issues and by the machinations they employ to prevent the access of other parties or even independent candidates into the arena of political power. \n\nIt is that greedy withholding of access that has led to the horror that now holds sway. People have stopped thinking for themselves and that is the most un-American of all possible consequences of the Great Experiment that I could ever have imagined. It is repugnant to me that any child should have to say that they live in fear of losing their lives simply because they exist, and it is all the more repugnant that this girl is neither the first nor the only ten year old child in America and around the world who has to live in fear of losing their lives for no other reason than the fact that they exist.\n\nForget the Republicans, forget the Democrats. The litany of both parties' betrayal of their promises is long, so long that neither one has any credibility left worth the mention. Do your own thinking and figure out ways that you can make your world better, and bring all of your energy to that task, because there is nothing to be gained by expecting the politicians of either party voluntarily donating any part of the largesse that they hoard and defend towards the welfare of any of the victims of the bipartisan dearth of compassion and empathy that has long since become their hallmark. The silence of the Democrats in the face of the fact that the Republican's Project 2025 is a real policy that is already being enacted is proof enough of their complicit abandonment of the people.\n\nBy the way, self defense by any means is always valid. Premeditated assault is not."

They created laws that enabled violence against their scapegoats while harshly punishing the scapegoats for simply existing. \n\nIf we had the same happen today, I'm entirely convinced that the Republican party would behave exactly as their ideological predecessors.

As members of Congress, we are here to work and represent our constituents, not to argue about bathrooms. I am proud to be a member of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. I want you to know that I‚Äôll stand with Congresswoman- elect McBride and the transgender community as I continue to fight against sexual orientation-based and gender identity-based discrimination and advocate for the rights of all LGBTQ+ individuals. Should Rep. Mace‚Äôs bathroom bill or any related legislation come to the House Floor for a vote, I‚Äôm keeping your message and my commitment to fighting for the transgender community, in mind.    \n\nSo yea, she can pound fucking sand.\n\nMy Response to her following the vote on the NDAA:\n\n> Congresswoman Strickland,\n> \n> I just read today that you voted against medical care for Service Members' children who are Transgender by voting \"Yea\" for the NDAA with its Amendments. If I read the words correctly in your reply to me, you advocate for the rights of ALL LGBTQ+ individuals. Or did you only mean ones that are old enough to vote for you? Teenagers are especially vulnerable, and you have just helped to marginalize them even further. These young Americans, nay human beings, deserve the same dignity and respect that I do as an adult, and you have enabled your Republican friends in stripping them of that identity and have taken away something that helps them feel normal and above all, helps them feel like the person who they are meant to be. I hope you reflect on the lasting damage that you have done to these young women and men. Your district has part of JBLM in it. This vote definitely affects families who live and work there, teenagers that look up to me as a mentor and as a role model for serving as a Transgender Service Member.\n> \n> I will take a long hard look whether or not I will support you come 2026. I will not forget.\n> \n> ***Name Redacted***  \n> Soon to be retired Senior Non-Commisioned Officer in the Army to a Country that I barely recognize anymore"

Nobody saw them, but they were there.\n\nThis might seem hard to believe, given all the hatred we find ourselves surrounded by, but there are now countless others doing the same for us, also quietly. We might not see them. We might not know the good deeds they are doing. But they are out there. They stand with us. And they are ordinary people, like you and me.\n\nAmerica will eventually do the right thing. But it won't come from the government. It will come from ordinary people like us, people who know this is wrong and refuse to participate in it. Our government won't protect us, but our communities will. Have faith. It's admittedly in short supply these days. But we have far more allies than we realize."

Even if I do keep my job, shit like bathroom bans (which Nancy Mace is already pushing for the whole government) and the potential to legalize discrimination of LGBT people in government will make life on the job for me and all government trans employees much harder...\n\nThis has only been in US politics and has gotten to this point because the right wing needed a scapegoat to spread their politics to more people via fear and hatred (sadly its been an effective strategy for them), and we trans people being not widely understood by a large number of non-LGBT people sadly made a good scapegoat for them. It's sadly turned us into the most marginalized minority in the US as of late. Also sadly some parts of the Western world at large as there's several nations where the right-leaning parties of the world tend to follow what the right wing of the US is doing and sadly, they have with the trans hatred and anti-trans laws as well. This is always been true with the Tories in the UK and they have followed suit hard there sadly with things like the infamous Cass Review, puberty blocker bans, putting trans people in the wrong gender NHS wards, trying to make HRT very hard to get, etc.\n\nI just hope this crap doesn't get to Jim Crow levels of marginalization but I fear that's where were heading..."

Now that would totally make sense. But one should not feel the need to change their  gender and make irreversible changes to their body just because the society expects specific genders to behave, walk, talk, think or even feel, a specific way, and they want to behave, walk, talk a different way. \n\nThere are so many reasons why transgenderism is so confusing and does not make sense to most people. And most of them are not able to freely express thoughts or ask questions due to the fear of it being called hate speech.

I wish the situation were better than that, but this has been done before in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Russia.\n\nMany of us thought \"it'll be OK somehow\". Most detransitioned (yes, including passable post-ops who have to bind their breasts and shave their hair to sort-of-pass as their birth sex) as a condition of release from police detention. A few live in hiding with supportive family, parents, or friends, and don't go outside. Those who can have all left.\n\nWe're in a similar situation now to the first days of COVID when cruise ships were cruising and everyone was in a river called \"denial\". That won't stay for much longer, sadly."

Additionally, he and his party are already trying to erase us from public life by banning us from changing our legal documents, banning us from the military, teaching positions, banning books about us in schools, and insisting that trans kids don't exist (they do, we all used to be kids and we were trans back then, even if we didn't know it. I would have so much less self-loathing and body dysmorphia had i not been forced to go through the wrong puberty. That i did not get to go on puberty blockers hurts me every day, and it'll never not hurt). Finally, to ur point, do u honestly believe the president-elect and conservative party are going to classify us as either male or female based on our post-transition identities? When they say \"male and female only,\" they mean that even if u take hormones and get surgeries, ur still whatever u were assigned at birth. Why tf would we want that when the whole point of transitioning is to not be labeled as such?\n\n\n\n\n2) People are each at different stages of their transitioning journey and they don't always \"pass\" (which in our community means to be read as cis with no indication of ur transness) for various reasons. Perhaps someone has just started their transition and hasn't had access to hormones or surgeries yet. Maybe they can't afford to look the way they want to (because again, they're coming for our healthcare). And the sad truth is that for some trans ppl, they just won't be able to pass even with hormones and surgeries for one reason or another (genetic lottery usually). Trans ppl who don't pass should still get to use the restroom in public. There is no epidemic of creeps and weirdos invading bathrooms. That's a fabricated distraction they throw out to inflame ppl's prejudice."

Smart Blue states will simply refuse to put gender markers on drivers' licenses (Australia has done this for all licenses since the 1980s in most states, and everywhere for a couple of years now) which means those licenses can be used anywhere without the risk of being prosecuted for fraud by a \"red state\".\n\nHormones will be a problem, because the FDA under new management is likely to ban their use for adult trans women, and many of the medical bodies who currently support us might find senior members end up mysteriously in jail for all sorts of Federal crimes or become \"accident prone\" until they withdraw their support.  \n  \nThe best our allies in Blue States might achieve is to buy us time to leave.  \n  \nI hope we'll see some activism similar to what happened in Denmark during the Holocaust:  \n  \n[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/king-christian-x-of-denmark](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/king-christian-x-of-denmark)   \n  \nState governments that report every single person in the state as being trans, and stop putting pronouns on any state documents and order doctors to delete any relevant medical history will make a detransition mandate difficult to enforce and impossible with post-ops.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Federal government already has records of your being trans, things may not end well."

    "comment_body": "Why does the discomfort of a few prejudiced cis ppl get to dictate the safety of trans ppl? Why do we have to have empathy for their biased and discriminatory views but not for the trans women who would be forced to use the wrong bathroom? Forcing a trans woman to use the men's room puts her in the same danger u say these cis women feel, only this time there's an actual threat and not simply the feeling of discomfort. Again, there is no concrete reason to fear trans women in bathrooms, there's not a pattern of behavior that shows they cant be trusted in there. The media would not let us hear the end of it if there were. Furthermore, they used the same \"safety in women's bathrooms\" line about desegregation. White parents didn't want black girls in their daughters locker rooms and restrooms and they used the idea of \"safety\" as a cover for their prejudice. But was there an epidemic of black women assaulting white girls in the bathroom? No. And now it's seen as a black mark on the history of the west. Surely u could say the same \"the world doesn't revolve around u\" line about the minority of cis women who make a stink about trans women in the bathrooms? Isn't it selfish to prioritize their prejudice over the safety of trans ppl, who again, are statistically not a threat to them? I live in Los Angeles, literally nobody bats an eye at a non passing trans person in the facilities. Everywhere could be so accepting if ppl just chilled out about the bathroom thing and realized it's not as big a deal as the media makes it out to be.\n\nHrt (hormone replacement therapy) isn't like drinking or getting tattoos, it's more like getting chemotherapy or a prosthetic limb. It's not recreational, it's medicinal, so that's not an accurate comparison when we're talking about minors and hormones. Chemotherapy can have drastic effects on one's body down the road at any age. Do u think parents should have the right to deny their children cancer treatment just because they don't believe in it? I think children should have rights over their own bodies, whether they be cis or trans, but that's a different argument and not necessarily relevant, so I digress. Furthermore, cis children are allowed to have gender affirming care and nobody worries that they might regret it later on. Cis boys and teens with gynecomastia are allowed to have their breasts removed, cis girls are allowed to get breast augmentations before they're 18, and cis children of any gender are permitted to take puberty blockers as a way of treating precocious puberty. All of these procedures have drastic and permanent effects on their bodies. Why do we permit them for cis minors but not trans ones?\n\nAdditionally, while yes, there are a certain number of ppl who will begin medical transition who later realize it wasn't the right thing for them, u could find the same phenomenon of regret for literally every medical procedure. And in the case of gender affirming healthcare for adults and minors, the number of satisfied patients VASTLY outnumbers the amount of desistors. Of ppl who medically transition, between 95 and 99% report being much happier, less suicidal, and less dysphoric about their bodies. Only about 1% to 5% will stop their medical transition, and even then, most of them only stop due to external factors such as lack of finances or lack of familial or community support. Most of them eventually end up resuming their medical transition later down the road. So it's merely a fraction of the 1-5% of detransitioners who end up having been cis ppl who made a mistake. The regret rate for hip surgery is something like 20 or 30%, and yet we don't bar ppl from getting hip surgery just because 20 to 30% of patients regret undergoing it. It does not make sense to deny gender affirming care to the 95-99% of ppl, children and adults, who desperately need it and will have their lives improved by it simply because a fraction of 1-5% of detransitioners have regrets. (That's not to say we shouldn't also have empathy for the cis ppl who end up not being trans, they are as much a part of our story and community as any one of us. I have friends who fall into this camp, and yet they remain stalwart allies and advocates for us, even as they realize it ultimately wasn't what they needed for themselves.)\n\nI would argue it is ideological bias, and not facts of reality, that is the reason for the UK clamping down on gender affirming care for minors. Every major trans healthcare organization internationally, such as WPATH, has condemned the Cass Report for failing to include trans perspectives and for being overall less than scientific, and yet both the Tories and Labour continue to use it to justify their actions against our community. It's been debunked to hell and back, yet they still insist on it. That's not right.\n\nThank u for reading and listening, u sound very open minded and I honestly and deeply appreciate u taking the time to seek out our point of view on these things. I am very happy to continue our discussion either here or over DMs if u like. Also, happy holidays üéÑ"

Wonder why.      \nEDIT: the excuses and justifications Russia uses for it's genocide, annexation and war crimes in Ukraine are the EXACT same as Israel uses for Palestine. If you support Palestine but not Ukraine (or viceversa) you don't give a fuck about imperialism and genocide. Just \"team sports\" and contrarianism for it's own sake. Genocide denial is anti-left."

In 1933, the Nazis began their reign of terror by first attacking trans people.\n\nDonald Trump and a number of GOP leaders have praised Hitler and/or allied with modern American Nazis and embrace the push toward fascism.\n\nI don't believe history will exactly repeat itself, but being social and political \"untouchables\" is another piece to that puzzle.\n\nThe Democrats and Gay, Inc (HRC, NCTE/A4TE, etc) have all proven to us time and again over the last quarter century that they will not fight for us if it will impact their ability to fundraise and thus, their salaries. We need to gather what staunch allies we have, and loudly push back together before it's too late. We already know the other tactic doesn't work. We need to lead this effort and not depend on those who have more privilege. We need to reach out to the people remaining of movements like ACT UP and other trans-friendly civil rights elders and benefit from the lessons they had to learn and the mistakes they made. Oh, and by the way - approximately 0.3% of US residents (650,000-900,000 persons) were infected with HIV in 1992. But they gathered allies and were effective in their fight. Today, being HIV+ is no longer a death sentence and for many the fear of it barely impacts their lives. Their tactics worked."

The outcome was a black eye on the community, but a foothold on all which would follow in the 2010s (Nicole Maines, Gavin Grimm, etc.)\n\nThat McBride spent a stint working at the HRC is extremely on brand for her approach of capitulating so eagerly in this whole Capitol theatre. She is shameful and demonstratively oblivious of our own people‚Äôs history in, at the very least, the U.S. these last 35 years."

She managed to kick down an impossible door. I'm not that worried how she did it, I'm amazed she had the wherewithal and courage to do it at all. She has demonstrated absolute courage. Now she foregoes her personal comforts to insure her voice will still be heard. Zooey Zephyr spoke up loudly and was silenced. I want Sarah in the House, doing her job, and voting in their face. I want to make the haters share the House with a trans person and force them insult a trans person to their face. It's easy if there are none around. It gets much more difficult if one is sitting in front of you. I want the whole World to see just how vile these people are. She is taking the brunt the abuse and putting herself in harms way, like a soldier, and not complaining. And she's doing this for you. If the Republicans want to publicly embarrass themselves with flagrant bigotry, by banning trans people from the restrooms, let them. It is our job as activists to resist. Sarah is doing her job and making it \neasy for us to do ours. I would call Sarah a burr under their saddle at the moment with the potential of becoming a match in the powder keg.

As you know, the federal ENDA ‚Äî with or without trans people ‚Äî didn‚Äôt pass. *Bostock* was a remedial, juridical back-fill, yet the federal Equality Act to follow, building upon the case law of *Bostock* and including trans people where ENDA did not, languishes and basically lives in dead letter office. So it would be meaningful to expand on the state which, in 2000, some bill passed. did it get signed into law by a governor?\n\nIn any case, McBride is, charitably put, an empty pantsuit. Zooey Zephyr and Leigh Finke, meanwhile? They‚Äôre doing good work. City councillors like Andrea Jenkins have been doing the good work for *decades*. \n\nEvery trans person who went to court to advance trans civil and human rights? *They* did good work, often out of their own pockets and sacrificing against their own futures and careers.\n\nMcBride either knew what was required for the solemn responsibility of being a trans public servant and reneged, or she didn‚Äôt understand it at all. I‚Äôm disinclined to buy the latter.\n\nEither way, she still draws a paycheque. She still has her *en suite.* Her security is, largely, set."

It's incredibly common in both men's and women's prisons, perpetrated both by inmates against other inmates and by guards against inmates.\n\nIn other words, a woman raping another woman in prison is something people in our society have openly decided they're okay with... until they see a trans woman. Then, suddenly, they're full of empathy for how women in prison are treated, no one deserves to be raped, etc. She doesn't even have to rape someone - she's treated as if she's a guaranteed rapist the moment they find out she's trans and in a women's prison. It's disingenuous, and it's disgusting. They're so upset about theoretical rape, yet they openly laugh at real rape. If they actually cared about preventing people from being raped, maybe they'd advocate for prison abolition or at least reform. But they don't, they just want to portray us as evil rapists."

I dont understand legally how there can be any distinction made between a post op trans woman and a cis woman legally?\n\nI'm assuming the main roadblock here is that they both got bottom surgery/changed gender marker while ALREADY BEING prisoners in men's prisons. So they have all this documentation and paperwork referring to them as M. Even after bottom surgery, even if the birth certificates are changed, the prisons are not updating the gender markers I'm assuming? Which is likely very illegal.

Then, at a Walmart, a 20-something body slammed me into the shelves and shouted slurs as he ran.\n\nI was also sexually assaulted because I'm trans. Standing in line at a department store and a woman came up behind me, grabbed my chest, and told her friend \"See, I told you they're not real!\"\n\nI was also assaulted at a Drag Queen Story Hour. III%ers were outside waving signs with gay porn on them and the guy didn't like that I pointed out that, by their logic, they were the pedos for doing that.\n\nIn all of these situations, the police didn't do shit to help me. That also includes my three-half brothers who are cops in Sedro-Wooley and Anacortes. They also didn't do shit when my life was being threatened by someone who posted an image of our father's personal information next to his rifle. So we're not on speaking terms anymore with them."

So yes, the question is valid. Puberty isn't \"normal\" if it is causing the child clinically significant distress.         \n\nWe've been treating children with puberty blockers since the 1980s, and in the early 90s we began applying it to gender dysphoria as well as precocious puberty. So, again, *why* do we need \"further research\" on one to determine it is safe, but not the other? What is the appreciable difference between why it is perfectly safe for one group of children and not the other?         \n\nIt's a bit like saying \"We can set your broken arm if you broke your right arm, but we need further tests to see if it's safe to also set your left arm.\" It is nonsense."

He is a believing Mormon so it constrains the kind of opinions and life you're allowed to have. He also wrote a fable about a musician who is not allowed to write music. I think it started as a rant about readers complaining that writers' work is derivative and wanting to make the point that all art has influences or something, but by the end of the story it makes you wonder if he's maybe writing about something else entirely."

That was late high school/early college for me so it doesn't feel that far away, but I guess that *was* 20 years ago...\n\nAs I remember it, that conversation lasted in my friend groups until about when the Ender's Game movie came out, and then transitioned over the next year or two after that into the much worse conversation on that woman and HP in the lead up to Fantastic Beasts.

I know lots of people willing to protect trans persons and we will do so as absolute best we can. I know it does not help the stress of it all. And it certainly does not make this situation feel any better, but many of us are willing to go great lengths to help. I know I just literally cannot sit by while this happens. I have to be able to sleep at night and that means doing all that I can). My heart is with you and all trans beings right now. My door is always open. \n\nI also saw your comment on r/politics regarding a similar issue. \n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to be. If a cis ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person wants to come in and get their fucking viagra pills, absolutely nothing is going to stop them from doing so.\n\nThere is no ‚Äúon the coin‚Äôs other side‚Äù here. They will absolutely look at me in the face and say ‚ÄúNo estradiol and spiranolactone pills for you because there‚Äôs a dick between your legs‚Äù, and then when a cis woman has been prescribed this for their own menopausal issues, they‚Äôll smile and gladly hand them over the fucking bag of pills.\n\nCis people will be okay. Maybe cis women will be slightly less okay, but definitely not when it comes to having access to fucking estradiol. There will be absolutely no consequences for any of the people that fit inside the one fucking arbitrary box.‚Äù\n\nI cannot respond there because I made a silly joke about a ghost assassin which they took seriously instead of it being a joke against someone making an actual threat. Anyhow, I was deeply moved by your comment and I too see the same issues you listed. You are spot on. And something needs to be done.\n\nWhat comes to mind though is that people who do care (and there are quite a lot of us) may consider some workarounds here. Cis allies may consider getting prescriptions to accidentally leave in the homes of trans persons (it‚Äôs a crime to knowingly give over a prescription so I formally do not suggest doing that - formally on record). But all things considered, when the government is attacking a small group of human beings just wanting to live and be themselves, their best and true selves in a way that literally harms no one‚Ä¶ when the government is targeting people and their healthcare and identity in ways that many other nations consider criminal (and rightfully so), perhaps there are more ways we need to consider helping that aren‚Äôt truly so bad (those who helped the Jews in Nazi Germany were committing crimes by doing so, but history showed they were the heroes upholding morality). I pray it never comes to this somehow. It‚Äôs all so beyond belief that anyone would attack such a small minority group of human beings minding their own damn business. It‚Äôs mind blowing. But may we find ways to subvert these twisted attacks by a sick party obsessed with destroying the lives of others. \n\nMy friend group (trans and allies) are working overtime to come up with anything possible. We will not stop fighting for basic rights for all. And we will do all that we possibly can. \n\nSending love and light your way. May morality always prevail, even in the darkest of times."

    "comment_body": "Aside from how condesceing this comment is, I would like to ask one thing: what do you propose then? Clearly liberals are a great evil upon this country, so do you suggest communism?\n\nWhile we‚Äôre discussing the historical merits of certain ideologies, are you aware of the fact that communists have a far greater track record of facilitating fascism and extreme social conservatism than liberals? Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Winter War. Mao‚Äôs China. Pol Pot‚Äôs Khmer Rouge. An alliance with Idi Amin. Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, Enver Hoxha, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. I mean how is it that Vladimir Putin, the world‚Äôs number one fascist at the moment, was allowed to join the Communist Party and grow influential within it then? \n\nBecause it‚Äôs politics. Ask any non-queer communist this question and you‚Äôll see what I mean: ‚ÄúIf you could usher in a communist form of governance, but on the condition that the harshest anti-gay and anti-trans measures were implemented, would you do it?‚Äù I guarantee most of them would say yes. What about a question about something else, then? ‚ÄúIf you could remove Israel from the middle east and give all the land to Palestine in exchange for the harshest anti-trans and anti-gay laws in the US, would you do it?‚Äù If the person is not queer, they probably will say yes.\n\nBecause there is always an issue that someone cares more about. Liberals, fascists, conservatives, progressives, communists, anarchists. EVERYONE. Why is there a hatred only for one? Stop presenting liberals as some deplorables that cannot be trusted. \n\nSo now back to this bill. Do you imagine the DAMAGE that Trump is going to do to America‚Äôs global standing? This bill funds the military through 2025. It gives Trump one less year to fuck around with the military. This bill needed to pass. You give the GOP and free pass for weaponising this fact but not liberals for voting for it, when both are just playing politics. I don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm not defending liberals, but why such a hatred in here? I‚Äôm more progressive than them, but I believe most liberals are good people at heart. I can say the same for most progressives, but not for most socialists, communists, fascists, and conservatives. \n\nYou telling the commenter you replied to‚Äîever so rudely I might add, a fact that pisses me off and makes me want to be rude‚Äîto go read about political history when you know next to nothing about political theory is a bit rich, don‚Äôt you think? Liberals are not throwing us under the bus. Not yet, anyways. That would look more like them *proposing* anti-trans legislation to win over voters or advance a certain policy. I understand that you see the writing on the wall. But that plays into political theory too. You, and so many others, are striking pre-emptively. Abandoning reasonable politics for extremist ideologies that are so much worse and less likely to succeed. That means that almost every elected politician will care less about you, because your vote doesn‚Äôt matter to them. That‚Äôs politics. Go learn about that. You‚Äôll learn a LOT that didn‚Äôt get taught to you in school."

He would never be so much of a snob to turn the trans voters who would see theirselves voting for him away. He‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúWell, I fucking hate this person and they‚Äôre gross, but I don‚Äôt really care as long as it means I win.‚Äù In comparison, Democrats are not beating the coastal elitist allegations when they‚Äôre the ‚Äúfascist, but woke‚Äù party, but then they don‚Äôt even bother doing the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù part when they start driving us away from their base."

That's a pretty big deal. Biden stepped down after the primary elections/caucuses and before the convention with enough time to transition from the Biden campaign to the Harris campaign, and immediately after the Republican convention. It was calculated, and to think otherwise is foolish. Donors control the committee, the committee controls the candidates, and candidates who step out of line are replaced. There was no option for serious contenders in the 2024 Dem primary because the DNC did not allow there to be contenders. They backed Biden and Harris, who had the wrong message to voters. It got us stuck with Trump/Vance for 4 years or more, and we lost any semblance of LGBTQ+ and environmental progress for potentially decades because of it."

Still, there remained no legal way to enforce the bill regarding treating trans patients. \n\nIn your case, there is no way to enforce this new bill.

But I do think you need to know that Canada isn‚Äôt going to give any American refugee status, not unless there was a full-scale civil war or some other complete social collapse. It simply is not going to happen.\n\nTaking off for Canada in an emergency isn‚Äôt bad thinking but don‚Äôt plan on refugee status. You‚Äôd just be traveling on a visa and then maybe overstaying if need be and accepting the many risks that come with this.\n\nBefore we start talking about impossible dreams of asylum as an American (and they are impossible) please everyone make sure you‚Äôve researched possible legal avenues of migration to a number of different countries. I myself have the option to go to Israel, which disgusts me as an anti-Zionist but I know from research that this is the only realistic path out for me. Yours might be elsewhere.\n\nI don‚Äôt think most people will need to leave the country though. I really don‚Äôt. Putting yourself in a blue state will help for now, and planning in the meantime will give you an extra layer of protection. Imagining a scenario where you receive asylum is not helpful because it is not realistic. We need to be very, very realistic."

Basically as long as it doesn't get cloudy it's fine to keep using. So one vial lasts me much longer and I still fill the prescription every month as written and store the extra.\n\nThe Spiro and Prog I don't have a year, those are harder to do but I could mono therapy for a good while with just E in an emergency until I could source more Spiro, and Prog is purely optional it just helps breast development and sleep regulation."

I honestly think that a national ban on gender affirming care in the USA would be a valid reason to seek asylum in Canada. And as I said that may depend on who is in charge in Canada in the coming years. Part of the reason magas are so anti-immigration is because many immigrants from mexico just come for \" a better life\" or to earn money to send home and these aren't valid reasons to seek asylum. I'm not saying seeking asylum in Canada would be a walk in the park but at least there would be cause."

The first episode focused on ‚Äúthe coach‚Äôs kid‚Äù and depicted anxiety and feelings of inferiority and pretending to be ok when you aren‚Äôt. The second episode‚Äôs focus was on the umpire/teacher and his feelings of loneliness and regret for not taking the next step in his relationship. This episode also depicted online dating and rejection. The third episode dealt with another middle schooler who had financial worries in her single parent household. She has to find ways to earn money for her own dues to be on the team and acts like a parent and mature for her age. Showing exhaustion from trying to balance her life. PLUS, there was a depiction of a teenage party and the garage had a haze in it. You can‚Äôt tell me that wasn‚Äôt smoke of some kind. The fourth episode was about single parenthood and trying to balance everything and put on a happy face for everyone. Again there is the same party scene but when the mom shows up. And you cannot tell me that half the teenagers don‚Äôt seem influenced on something! One sounded like she was slurring her words. And there was mention of ‚Äúupstairs‚Äù at a party. So, their argument is even more bs because they are not ‚Äúletting these parents discuss certain subjects with their children on their terms‚Äù i.e. implied underage drinking, teenage parties, and potentially implications of Mary Jane."

Blue and pink stereotypical depictions of men and women enter and exit their respective bathrooms. The girl pulls out her phone, examining her reflection in the screen. She seems torn. Another girl pops up behind her, smiling widely, with two fluffy pigtail braids and glasses. She puts her arm around the first girl's shoulder, and they walk into the women's room together. Cut to the first girl washing her hands at the sink, and fixing her headband. Her pigtailed friend waves and leaves. She waves back, smiling, touching her face in the mirror. A little girl then enters, drinking a juice box and wearing a cast. There is something orange all over her face, hands, and cast (the juice?). She tries to reach the sink to turn it on, but she's too short. The first girl comes over to turn on the faucet for her. The young girl smiles at first, then gives the first girl a perplexed look. The first girl looks mortified, then gives an awkward smile and says something. The camera zooms in on her mouth. She frowns, clutching her throat, and looks back into the mirror. Her reflection shatters, breaking up into Picasso-like harsh shapes. The reflection's jaw sharpens like a Greek god. The cheekbones grow into harsh jagged edges. Her nose is a massive trapezoid, her brows angular and broad. It snaps into a stereotypical \"male\" bathroom symbol in bright blue in the mirror. She jumps back. It cuts a high angle view of the little girl, a massive broad shadow looming over her. Cut to a low angle view of the first girl, heavily shadowed, looking embarrassed and afraid. The bathroom behind her warps and spirals. She runs from the bathroom, crying, past the confused little girl. She slams the door and holds herself against it for a moment before taking off again, running past a crowd of people staring at her. She takes refuge in what seems to be a garage or shed, hands over her ears, full panic attack. Her phone buzzes. It's her dad. She answers, talking to him for a few moments, twirling her hair. Suddenly, her face splits again into the Picasso shapes. She tries to fake a smile for her dad, but her Picasso lips fly off her face. She quickly sticks them back on. Her whole face falls off, dropping to the ground in pieces. We can see her eyelashed eye blinking. She fumbles around to put herself back together when we see a shadow fall over her. It's her coach. He approaches her as she scrambles to replace her face, turning away from him in shame. He sits down with her, trying to say comforting things but she buries her face in her knees. Finally, she looks up at him with a slight smile and they fist bump. She giggles. End."

I will say that the episode (\"The Gatekeeper\") was pretty good, such ashamed it was blocked due to how the state of the US is going when it comes to LGBTQIA+ People.\n\nAlso want to clarify for anyone who still think Non Binary Folks are Woman Lite, is wrong cuz Non Binary People are under the Transgender Umbrella but not everyone who is Non Binary sees themselves as Transgender. \n\nAnyone can be Non Binary and doesn't matter what their Biological sex was, Gender Identity is not always align with sex and can show any forms of Gender Expressions and should not be pressured to showing Androgyny in order to apart of the Non Binary Umbrella."

When he tried to get trans kicked out of military, they stopped him on an issue he expected to be no big deal.  They didn't roll over and do what he said.  He has been gunning for trans ever since.\n\nAnd please don't tell me I'm overreacting, he destroyed my career trajectory with his BS and I have been watching anything with him and trans like a halo ever since.  I would love to believe he will walk it back, but that's not his style, not unless he can't make good on a promise, then he walks it back to save face.  \n\nWe don't have the same protections we did going into 2016 this time.

The \"resets\" work when the public has the memory of a fucking goldfish, and when they do it over the course of a decade.\n\nI think everyone should be familiar with the text \"they thought they were free\", which includes some *frighteningly* familiar passages of accounts of the march toward genocide in Nazi Germany: https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html\n\nOne relevant passage that I find very important personally: \n\n> \"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That‚Äôs the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked‚Äîif, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ‚Äô43 had come immediately after the ‚ÄòGerman Firm‚Äô stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ‚Äô33. But of course this isn‚Äôt the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\nthis is the prod->reset cycle that user ChefDear8579 was talking about. If they had started with \"tr***y healthcare is now illegal\" there would have been outcry, just like the MASSIVE outcry in the 2010's in response to proposed bathroom bans. Yet we got all the way here once they learned to take small enough steps"

Soon after that medical intervention means certain things are mandatory regardless of risk, personal situation, etc, and if you can't clear the checklist, you're locked out of everything. Soon after that medical intervention gets locked behind an increasingly restrictive checklist of requirements. \"Oh you're a lesbian trans woman? No you're not get out of here those don't exist you're just a sick man trying to prey on women.\" \"Oh you're a gay trans man?

I believe all the examples you quoted are under the five-year limit.\n\nThe new bill makes the changes of 1) Providing a section on the petition of candidacy to disclose the former names required by law and 2) Making the change that one need not be of the same political affiliation to make a challenge. It does not change the five-year limit.\n\nNonetheless, this law (both as-is and under the new bill) disparately impacts transgender/non-binary/intersex people (since it can force disclosure of a name that for the majority of cis people would not convey any sensitive information - but unless the deadname was gender-neutral would forcibly out a trans person)."

Those whose breasts were deemed big enough were allowed to keep their bras. Everyone else had to surrender theirs, along with anything else considered ‚Äúfemale,‚Äù such as women‚Äôs underwear and toiletry items.\n\n>Josie Takach, who is incarcerated in a men‚Äôs facility south of Tallahassee, said a male doctor told her to lift up her shirt, then glanced at her breasts and wrote something down without saying a word. When she tried to ask a question, a nurse ‚Äútold me not to ask any questions and to just shut up and do what I‚Äôm told,‚Äù she recalled.\n\nHow is this not a human rights violation? This should be seen as criminal activity at the highest level by the state of Florida. Ron DeSantis should be considered a serial sexual offender for greenlighting this."

Contrary to the medical mainstream, the bulletin suggests those seeking hormone therapy may have endured ‚Äúshort-termed delusions or beliefs which may later be changed and reversed‚Äù and recommended against providing any gender-affirming medical care unless extensive barriers are overcome.\n\nThat same day, at Florida Department of Corrections facilities across the state, transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria were rounded up and informed that FDC policy had been changed, ‚Äúup to and including hormone therapy.‚Äù They were specifically told that they would no longer have access to clothing and grooming standards that accord with their gender identity and would have 30 days to comply.\n\nTransgender women were told that those who did not cut their hair in compliance with male grooming standards would be forcibly shorn, and those who did not turn in their female undergarments and feminine canteen items would be disciplined. Transgender women were forced to have their breasts examined to determine if their breasts were large enough, in the eyes of the department, to require a bra.\n\n‚ÄúFlorida officials are waging a baseless campaign to dehumanize and degrade incarcerated people like our client,‚Äù said **Li Nowlin-Sohl, senior staff attorney at the ACLU‚Äôs LGBTQ + HIV Project**. ‚ÄúAllowing this policy to move forward threatens the basic human rights of transgender people in the state‚Äôs custody and the court‚Äôs order today affords the state‚Äôs policy more credulity than it deserves when the clear intent of the state is to ban this health care outright.‚Äù\n\nFuck these Florida fascists and¬† this¬† Corrupt Trump appointed judge,¬† [Allen Winsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Winsor),¬† for allowing¬† cruel and unusual punishment on the state‚Äôs incarcerated trans people!"

We're doing better than we were, say, 30 or 40 years ago but the current political movement is trying to set things back 50 or 75 years.\n\nI remember volunteering at a queer community center back in the mid-90s. That same year, the city legally allowed employers to fire folks if they were gay. This was also the same time the community center was having meeting on whether to stay an \"LGB\" community center or formally become an \"LBGT\" community center. That was when I discovered it was safer to be seen as a shy & awkward gay man than come out as trans & stayed in that closet for a couple more decades of utter misery & self loathing. I remember those days as I'm sure you do as well. Being so dismissive as to say \"we're doing fine\" is not only insulting but dangerous."

I *guarantee* you that there are white, racist parents out there who do *not* want their kids to be friends with or hang out with black kids at all. I've literally met some, sadly. So shouldn't Disney let those racist parents \"have difficult and sensitive conversations with their kids on their terms\" about racial issues, as well? *Hmm*?

That's the *only* difference. In a different time and place, the same cowards at Disney would absolutely be making similar excuses for cutting out stories featuring black characters, or strong/non-traditional female characters, or whatever else. They'll happily stand aside and say nothing while battles for human rights are fought, and then will run in afterwards, *after* the fight is won, to ride on the coat-tails and go \"oh look what supportive allies we're being!\""

I should note the reverse is also true for lgbt groups and progressive orgs, once the gays secured their rights there were no more excuses, it was finally trans time and the major work shifted to trans issues. Once again it is the rapid presence of trans people demanding access and rights that set all this in motion. We might call it a trans tipping point.

I don't know what to do, like I'm preparing, but i some stuff seems unpreppable (guess that's how genocides kinda go). Prolly gonna bug out if I don't have a formal move to sanctuary states, but this rhetoric and bad science is everywhere. Their next line is that our doctors and supportive therapists and families were abusing us to isolate us from support and them from their friends. Already attacked a gold standard provider and researcher for youth today with a destransitioner lawsuit and boosted slander. Fuck."

Like how Jim Crow was a blip or the Tulsa massacre omitted entirely. At least we have abilities for redundancies of our knowledge, but speaking these words gives me chills. Flashbacks of novels I've read but never wanted to live through, printed to warn of this. \n\nIt is truly unbelievable how easily people folded on everything, and will continue to outside the actual resistance movement. People want to believe whatever is easiest and live in fairy tales, even family members. We'll pay dearly and first, but they're creating their own hell as well. They'll scapegoat minorities until there's no more, or it somehow stops, and then people are stuck with nothing and an oppressive surveillance state wrapped around Christianity and a god King."

Ideally they would have a charter that no member of the party shall take any corporate funding (or whatever phrasing would best keep them from being bought), and use an angry, populist platform.

Trump has filed bankruptcy eight times walking away from billions in debt, but we draw the line at students? The law does not allow bankruptcy for students. Why not? Why can you owe billions like Trump did and walk away from it, borrow millions like MTG did and walk away from it, but if you owe $50,000 for student loans you're on the hook for life? People say we can't afford the money for that, but then $2 TRILLION by Trump for the very top added to the debt: no problem.\n\nAs for Trans rights, he should have finished those. If Trump undoes those that's on Trump, not Biden. Why Biden is scared of Trump so much is beyond me. Like the Infrastructure deal: he's afraid Trump will undo it. So? That's on Trump. Biden could have been on the right side of history, but once again proves why he never should have had the job."

Student loan forgiveness going into effect through existing programs isn't a thing Biden can really take credit for.  PSLF and other income driven repayment plans have existed for a long time.  They aren't new to Biden.  Suspending interest accumulation and payments during the pandemic was new and pretty great, and the potential $20k student loan forgiveness program he was proposing was pretty great, but it was blocked.  I don't think they were even able to reverse some of the changes that the Trump team made in his first term that attacked student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying Biden was a bad president nor am being critical.  I didn't agree with his position of Israel, but other than that he's been second probably only to J Carter and FDR.  My point is that it seems at times they try to give credit where credit isn't due and that doesn't help, and just makes it look like they're desperate to preserve his image when he's already done so many great things.  I'm holding out hope that he allies an extremely liberal presidential signing statement to effectively neuter section 708 of the 2025 NDAA that is going to be crossing his desk."

Andrew Cuomo was an abuser of women but got us gay marriage.\n\nMy point here is that we are not at the state of trans acceptance where any other issue can matter to you.  You're going to have to vote for politicians that wreck the climate, prop up the police, and nuke the middle east.  Because they're doing all those things while actively making it easier for us to exist.\n\nIn time, you can start voting on other issues.  Acceptance becomes normal as the past fades away.  In 1969, people were arrested nightly for being gay.  You couldn't hold hands with a same-sex partner in public.  Right here in the Greenwich Village.  In New York Fucking City.  Now, it's not like that, and it's because people voted for their rights above all else.  There are openly gay Republicans now and while I think that's pretty dumb, that's how little these rights matter today because they're the default and are taken for granted.\n\nTrans people are not yet in that position.  It's 1968 and we're still waiting for our Stonewall.  You can not vote, or you can throw your vote away on a third party, and it will accomplish absolutely nothing.  Or you can find the trans allies and support them, and let the winds shift towards acceptance.\n\nIt sucks to hear this but that's where we are right now.  Fix trans rights today, fix billionaires tomorrow.  You can't take on the billionaires if you're dead."

The current state of the world sucks so bad, and for us in the u.s. it's quickly getting worse.

We're less than 1% of the population, but no less feisty in fighting for our rights. \n\nThey need to take a good look in the mirror and ask themselves why they hate a good segment of the American population and are actively fighting to curtail their rights, by way of DISCRIMINATION BY FEDERAL LAW, IN VIOLATION OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT & Founding principles of this country. The rights apply to ALL, not just SOME Americans, not just Americans you find tasteful, not just Americans you agree with. \n\n\"For the children\" is just a convenient excuse to genocide the trans youth, when childhood is the most opportune time to change your gender. They demonize trans people, so they go after the youth first, they are the canary, and the canary is fucking dying hard. Then the adults, then they're gonna throw the age up, among other fascistic tyranny things. \n\nThis is fascism by the way, there is zero reason to attack this out group, zero reason to attack Americans' way of life, their liberty, their freedom. If they can do it to a trans person, they can do it to you. They've already done it to women, forcing them into Gestational Slavery against the 13th amendment. Abortion Bans are prima facie unconstitutional as involuntary servitude. We banned that, remember?"

    "comment_body": "I'm seeing some confusion in comments so to be clear: \n\n1) This isn't a guaranteed pass. While dems have been useless at blocking youth care bans, they have successfully gotten other adult care bans edited out from bills. \n\n2) If this does go through, this effects *medicare/medicaid* specifically. Not private insurance. \nNor is this a Hyde amendnent type deal, though we know they also want that in the coming years and this is the first step. (And Abortion providers have already been dealing with bans on federal funding for decades, and providers like planned parenthood have already begun providing hrt without federal funding. In local communities, I think we really need to start trying to put non-federally funded health care infrastructures in place like pro-choice activists have been working on for abortion for decades now.)  \n\n3) Obviously, diy is an option. But beyond that, I'd also like to point out that rx coupons exist and are often shockingly good at lowering costs. Even without insurance, HRT is often \"only\" around 20-50/month for pills or injections (gels tend to be considerably more) if you do price comparisons for pharmacies and check for coupons.  I'd *also* like to point out that many people's doctors have been preparing for this by coding their diagnosis as not gender dysphoria but a hormone imbalance, and that if your gender is legally changed on all / most documents and your doctor is chill, I would suggest asking them about changing your diagnosis."

Patients often pay in cash, either because they don't have coverage for abortion, or because they don't want an abortion on their medical record. In response, abortion funds were created to allow people who don't have insurance coverage or the means to afford an abortion on their own to have access‚Äù\n\nI think this confirms what I was saying.¬†"

Nonetheless, the result would be the government seeing you as your AGAB with (now having) a name more common for the opposite gender, not as your identified gender.\n\nWhat they've done in those school cases is require parental permission for ANY deviance from the student's legal name. If it's a nickname the student goes by at home, no problem besides the paperwork. If the student is cis but dislikes the name their parents gave them and prefers to go by something else, it would be annoying but probably not disastrous. If it's a trans student who isn't out to their parents, there's a big problem. (AFAIK no school has gone the route on being the judge if a name is \"appropriately gendered\" or not.)\n\nAs for organizations continuing to show your deadname even after you legally changed it, like the \"must use your legal name\" example in my last post, it depends on whether or not they'd do the same for a cis person who legally changed their name (which would include married or previous married names). Obviously, the privacy aspects are very different between trans deadnames and name changes related to marital status, but one way they can make it harder for trans people is to treat all name changes \"equally\" regardless of the privacy ramifications."

But here‚Äôs the top paragraphs:\n\n>For the last few years, the GOP has coalesced around an idea that would short-circuit essentially all trans health care in America: banning federal funds from going to businesses that provide health care specific to changing one‚Äôs sex or gender identity, including hormones and surgeries. It would essentially signal to the private sector that if it wants federal dollars, it needs to stay away from sex- or gender-affirming care, and bow down to right-wing pundits who aim to, in their own words, ‚Äúeradicate‚Äù and ‚Äúerase‚Äù this form of health care. \n\n>Language in House Republicans‚Äô most recent funding bill for the Health and Human Services Department would do just that ‚Äî ban money from any federal program to entities that do ‚Äúsocial transitioning‚Äù or drugs and surgery for ‚Äúgender dysphoria.‚Äù Gender dysphoria is the specific diagnosis doctors use to justify those medical interventions. This legislation has not gotten a vote yet and would need to be reintroduced next Congress to be considered. But it has been a top priority for Republican lawmakers in the House, and Trump himself has promised he‚Äôd ask Congress ‚Äúto permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these [trans] procedures.‚Äù\n\n>Bans like these can lead to the private sector discontinuing behaviors altogether ‚Äî and once they are in place, they are hard to get rid of: The Hyde Amendment, enacted in the 1970s, led to most abortions no longer being performed in hospitals, and is continually renewed each year. \n\n>Medical groups and civil rights advocates in D.C. tell Rolling Stone they believe that if a Hyde-level ban on federal funding were enacted, many hospitals will simply prioritize federal dollars over continuing this highly specialized form of medical care. So much medicine is performed through hospital systems and universities that this could mean ending access for many."

What about all of the other issues they moved to the right on? If they're willing to move back and forth then what do democrats really stand for?\n\nI voted for Harris, but I wasn't happy with what she had to say. In her interview to me she sounded like a republican light. When trump was being racist she didn't fight him on it. She missed every opportunity to stand up for civil rights. She didn't run a campaign of change, she ran a campaign of moderate stasis. A vote for Harris was a vote to keep everything the way it was and that is why democrats lost.\n\nUntil I see real change in democrats, instead of the spineless cowards we have now, I'll just vote for a 3rd party."

Thus these working class voters MAGA voters happily support the Republican Christian nationalist agenda to eradicate us. They are thus the main cause of our problems, so I hate them more than the amoral Dems\n\nThat said I agree we need a new party as none of the two main ones are worth a damn. However, Id becareful of plenty of leftist parties because many are transphobic as well. The Green party‚Äôs vice president, Buch Ware, had a similar opinion on trans people as much of the current GOP.

The election results and subsequent polling shows this was an extremely popular view. We‚Äôve had other extremely popular movements throughout our history, including the way our country treated our Native American friends‚Äô and neighbors‚Äô ancestors, the way the aids epidemic was handled, and the Japanese internment camps, which should strike particularly close to home here in Washington. Every single movement in our history that has targeted people based on who they are to harm or prevent their recognition as a complete and whole person deserving equal protection and equal rights under the law has eventually, rightfully, come to be recognized as an atrocity. There were those that stood against these atrocities because they knew they were wrong. There were many more that stood by or were complicit because they weren‚Äôt willing to oppose the popular view.\n\nTrans healthcare is often life saving healthcare. The regret rate for transition is lower than for nearly any other form of healthcare. In every place where transition related healthcare has been restricted, health outcomes and mental health of trans people has worsened even leading some to end their lives. Can you imagine knowing the people responsible for representing you either want you harmed, feel indifferent to that harm, or feel it is not worth even trying to prevent it?\n\nThe reality is that while Republicans are acting to harm trans people, Democrats have now decided that they don‚Äôt feel it is necessary to even try to prevent it, yourself included. I hope you can live with the knowledge of that choice, because many trans people, including trans children can‚Äôt."

The reporting suggests Democrats arent willing to go much further than words and statements to defend trans rights, and the best thing we can do right now is reach out to Senators immediately to make them feel the pressure and prevent a surprise like the 81 Dems on the House version earlier this week."

They might oppose the bill on paper, but they are also clearly signaling to reporters that if the issue is forced on them (eg, choosing between not passing the bill in time or passing a bill with the provisions) that they will vote for the provisions in order to pass the bill.\n\n>And we should not assume that our voices have no impact, or that all hope is lost. Seth Moulton, one of the first anti-trans Democrats after the election, appears to have learned this lesson already. After a large pro-trans rights office outside his office last month, Rep. Moulton appeared to walk back most of his comments and voted ‚ÄúNo‚Äù on the NDAA bill in the House this week. Similarly, H.R. 9495, which would have allowed Trump to shut down non-profit organizations with little accountability, lost significant support in the House from Democrats after constituents flooded their phones and emails with opposition.\n\n81 Democrats in the House is more than 1/3 of House dems. It only takes 20% of Senate dems voting yes for this bill to pass, and we cant just wait around hoping that they get the message. Manchin and Sinema are basically guaranteed to vote for it, so there's only 7 votes to spare. People have to mobilize and contact them immediately.\n\nAdditionally, the threat is very real. I was surprised by the 81 Dems this week. I dont want to be surprised again. This article was prompted by the commentary on the Independent article by another trans journalist who works there which interpreted the reporting as Senators backing the bill (including those who signed the letter):\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/iododds.bsky.social/post/3ld7mv5hgwk2s\n> BREAKING: Key Senate Democrats told my colleague \n@ericmgarcia.bsky.social\n they'll back a \"must-pass\" military spending bill that restricts trans healthcare.\n\n> It's a sign that Dem resistance on trans rights is already waning ‚Äì even before the GOP takes control. www.independent.co.uk/news/world/a..."

Regarding trans people specifically, what they want is elimination.  The culture war has to do with the aggressive propaganda and the anticipated effects to communities we can expect from the passage of legislation.  The process is to effect the culture, which in turn effects the politics, which in turn effects the legislation, which in turn reinforces the culture.  And the machine turns.\n\nThe republicans, conservative strategists, and conservative influencers rely on an old and highly manipulative communication strategy called [Accusation in a Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusation_in_a_mirror).  This strategy, which is aided by the pro-conspiracy culture that has been amplified in conservative circles, is the keystone of their tactics.  The most effective way to address manipulation is to call it out (not to the manipulator directly, but) to all the witnesses of the act."

That's a wild reading. \n\nEach one had to discover transness for themselves, though, frequently thinking they or a few others were the only one, on account of the centuries of erasure and suppression. They were usually surrounded by cis people, with cis people telling them that they were unthinkable. \n\nThat's how I grew up. That's how most trans people in my generation and before it grew up. We had to free our minds of cissupremacy without a lot of clear paths or possibility models. \n\nBut trans kids growing up now *know* they're not alone and aren't even rare, that they are more common than doctors and lawyers combined, almost as common as redheads.\n\nAnd that's new. If you think that trans kids in the 90s, 80s, 70s, 60s, 50s, 40s, or 30s had access to a large, organized community of millions of openly trans people, that's just not historical."

I've certainly got no interest in slandering the reputations of activists going back to Francis Thompson, and a neutral reading of what I said clearly is not that. \n\nBut we've never had a historical  moment like this one in the modern west, where a million trans people grew up with trans equality so close they could taste it and then had it snatched away, where another million and a half trans people had seen it come into being over the past 20 years, and where the last 500000 had watched trans people's situations change unbelievably much in their lifetimes, through multiple cycles of backlash and moral panic.\n\nThis is a recipe for something *different*. Conditions are not the same as they were in the past--largely *because* of generations of work *building* the political consciousness that now exists. \n\nDo you really think Rivera would find that a shocking statement?"

There are comparable numbers of out trans people now as there were out gay people in the early 2000s. We know we're here.

She dropped out after a few weeks due to heat stroke. according to wikipedia, when she dropped out, this happened:\n\n>When her withdrawal from the Citadel was announced, upperclassmen celebrated their return to an all-male school, with one cadreman leading the recruits in an altered marching song of \"Marching down the avenue. Now we know that Faulkner's through. I am happy and so are you!\"\n\nNancy Mace was the first female graduate of the citadel, which does say something positive about her; given the attitude towards women at the citadel, that she was able to make it through and still graduate is a positive thing to say about her.\n\nthat said, she still is a graduate of the citadel, which attracts right wing students, and turns them even more right wing."

If Democrats oppose it, the GOP will paint them as wanting to sterilize and do genital surgery on minor children. The GOP can propagandize moderates that this new ban is not about HRT, but just about genital surgery, and the crazy Democrats won't stop doing genital surgery on children. If Democrats support it, it puts a schism between LGBT community and Democrats.

While directly meaning something like ‚Äúsissy men‚Äù, it is contextually used in reference to specifically the k-pop aesthetic. To be more exact, the state is targeting a number of plastic surgery procedures intended to imitate European facial structures that have become a major fad across large swathes of Asia and have led to endemic body dysmorphia in the region. What is being banned is not a certain means of self-presentation, but the popularization of this plastic surgery/K-pop idol culture.\n\nFor future reference, a sure sign of a media disinformation campaign is the lack of linkages to first person sources. Note that none of these stories, (even NPR), link to an actual source. The progression of an organic story can usually be traced back to some primary source through citations and hyperlinks; as far as I can tell, this can‚Äôt.‚Äù"

There are multiple high profile examples of actors who go by \"stage names\" not because they wanted a new name, but because their own actual name was already \"claimed\" by another member of the Screen Actors Guild which has rules preventing two members from performing under the same name professionally (Emily \"Emma\" Stone and Michael \"Keaton\" Douglas being the two most notable examples I am aware of). I don't know if there is already a \"Nick Dumont\" in the SAG, but even if there isn't I imagine there are likely a few hoops to be jumped through when changing your professional name as an actor because of these rules."

It is choosing a side that is against people. And we all notice. We all hear about it, and those of us who loved his comedy feel hurt and betrayed. Something we loved now has that stain on it of it's creator being *against* us.\n\nSo many people imagine they are just living in a world where no trans people can hear them. They think they can be critical of trans people and the people who support us without actually having anyone be hurt by it. It's not true. We hear. We feel the hatred. \n\nAs much as there are people who don't support trans people who will welcome this sort of thing, they're not personally affected. They aren't going to feel better that someone is showing kindness to them, it's not personal. For us it's personal.\n\nSo that's the option. I know that to a lot of cis people, being trans seems weird or whatever. But it's a choice. It's a choice to say I support people and it's a choice to say I'm against people. This isn't a debate of ideas. It's a debate of whether to show kindness or hate."

They see TERFs as enemies, and rightly so, because TERFs want trans people to have fewer rights or to not exist at all. They are the aggressors, and you can't blame trans people for resisting an aggressor. Those two sides are not the same.\n\nAnd I certainly don't see trans people as my enemies. The category of \"woman\" isn't finite, there's plenty of room for all of us. The existence of trans women doesn't threaten my identity at all. Nor does the existence of trans men and nonbinary folx threaten my identity as a tomboy, because people can be cis and non-conforming too (or trans an non-conforming, for that matter). \n\nI guess what I'm saying is, his \"two sides\" are not cis women/people and trans women/people. The \"two sides\" are transphobes and trans people. And it is not necessary for transphobes to \"have all the rights and dignities that they demand\" for there to be peace. Quite the contrary - that's a prime example of the paradox of tolerance. And Stephen is *this close* to getting it in the first part of his statement.

It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders.

There's **so much more** to this than whether you can get HRT or not. One of Trump's first acts in office the first time was rolling back legal protections for trans people in housing, employment, and insurance. If HRT is available, but you can't take it without putting your home, healthcare, and income on the line, then it might as well not be available. Sure, some people will have good employers, insurance, and landlords, but not everyone will have all three. \n\n2. The military is one of (the?) largest employers of trans people in the country. Kicking trans troops out is not some minor deal.\n\n3. And most importantly, \"don't worry, they won't overturn Roe\" is exactly what people said to the doomers in 2016, and at the time I seriously believed they wouldn't.

If they don‚Äôt withdraw their rules, then the Trump admin can easily hijack all the work they‚Äôve done the last four years and pervert them to their own terms. By withdrawing them, the Trump admin has to start from scratch and do all the research and work themselves which is a lot!

For example, the law says that a business generally cannot discriminate against an applicant on the basis of religion, and must make reasonable accommodations. For example, an extremely devout Christian may request to have Sundays off. However, if an essential part of the role is working on Sundays (for example, working on an NFL camera crew), the business is allowed to reject an applicant for that reason.\n\nSimilar situation with trans athletes: schools generally cannot restrict trans athletes from playing sport according to their gender. However, in some sports (wrestling, for example), it may be the case that a legitimate study shows that trans girls who have not undergone medical transition are more likely to injure a cis girl in a bout (as far as I know, no such study exists at present, but this is just a hypothetical). This can be used as evidence that a restriction on trans girls who have not medically transitioned before competing in wrestling is necessary. However, it cannot be used as justification for a blanket ban because there's no evidence presented that trans girls who have medically transitioned are more likely to cause an injury.\n\n> We've seen the argument already that experiencing any amount of male puberty gives trans girls an unfair advantage\n\nThey can argue anything they want, they still need to show evidence for that argument to get any reasonable judge to take them seriously.

Same goes for people in legislative and executive positions.  There may be exceptions where a person elected to office DOES have experience in things like finance or medicine but anyone holding an office where they write, enforce, or interpret law should be deferring to expert opinion and expert testimony from experts in the field that the law impacts and should be taking these factors into account during ruling.\n\nThere are a lot of judges, legislators, and executives who have predetermined what they believe the law should be based on their personal opinions and not based on anything resembling reality or professional consensus."

We don‚Äôt know.

They're already pushing hard for the Kids Online Safety Act, which the Heritage Foundation fully intends to use to persecute us.  They've already betrayed us in several state legislatures.\n\nBiden himself randomly denounced GAS for adolescents (which is already extremely rare) mere days after visiting Stonewall on the campaign trail.  Harris, in an interview, refused to state that gender affirming care was a human right, and instead, openly told the interviewer that she would not fight for us.  This is hardly surprising considering the fact that, in 2015, she used the full weight of her office (CA Attorney General) to ensure that the state-sanctioned sexual torture of trans prisoner, Michele Lael-Norsworthy, continued, despite a judge's orders to the contrary."

Republicans have the upper hand and can force stuff along.  All they have to do is play for time and they can pass it.  On the flip side, the military is hurting, the soldiers and sailors have not had the luxury of having a job that keeps up with the recently fast advancing inflation rates.  Being able to pay off meals not to mention updating the housing situation is important.  For the democrats to try to push against that bill is a loose loose for every one in the long run.\n\nTrust me I hate it, at least they were able to pull out the part about limiting trans care for the active duty.  The children can use other insurances.  It's not a good thing, and it's expensive, but it's something.  For the adults, while using other insurances is an option, losing Tricare approval to continue transition would be akin to telling them that either we can detransition or get out.  So ya, this truly sucks and being around Christmas makes it an outright bad joke, but this is just the beginning of what we can expect to happen since the US decided to vote for Trump and for the Republican trifecta.  \n\nThat does not mean we should give up, women went through it, blacks went through it, gays went through it, now I guess it's the Transgender's turn to fight through prosecution and the unjust bias.  We got lucky before, skipping the major battles, Obama gave us a gift that just got pulled out from under us.  Guess it's time.\n\nSadly, I can't even blame the Democrats on this one."

The Democrats know that the spending is important to provide for those who serve and that with trump coming in, the Republicans are emboldened so there is no way they would back down.  That being said, the Republicans in this case had no reason to include the anti trans part in the first place.\n\nIt honestly hurts and to top it off, it targets the children of us serving to protect the country in a very direct manner.  Children whom already have a harder time due to having to move due to orders, who have to say good bye to their parents in ways that no child should have to.  It's just cruel.\n\nI'm beginning to feel that if they keep this up, they may end up working against themselves in the long run."

I even go so far as to say I think if you can afford it while in prison, then the prison should facilitate you getting the surgery. \n\nThe only line I'm not willing to cross is \"I don't think the government should pay for a surgery for a person convicted of a crime.\" Yes, many people are not in prison for good reasons. But many are. And just because that person is transgender I don't think they should have access to costly surgery on public dime. Personally paying for it, sure, no problem, work with them the way you'd work with someone who needs a non-essential but needed surgery. \n\nThat's pretty much the only line, and honestly, it's mostly because I think its' fair as a give-and-take to put a line up that gets us 95% of what we want.

Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies and voluntary free associations. A historically left-wing movement, anarchism is usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement (libertarian socialism).\n>\n\n>Although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for emancipation. Various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Paris Commune, the Russian Civil War and the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more, growing in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, anti-war and anti-globalisation movements.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut nice try tho."

Then, Musk comes along and tweets up a storm. Now, the Republicans back out. They come up with a less favorable deal, and Democrats sign it without a fight. Republicans currently control only the house. They don't control the Senate. They don't control the presidency. Signing the deal under these circumstances signals to Republicans that as long as they can control one of the house, the senate, or the presidency, then they can make whatever demands they want when it comes to the budget, a democrats will crave. Worse yet, it signals to Musk that he can do this again. As bad as a temporary shutdown would have been, I think caving could potentially be much worse for our country in the long run."

The youth turnout in particular was ridiculously high.

His very long track record in politics does not reflect well on him in terms of being progressive. If we look at his past, he was always centrist, and if anything often regressive. Not only that, but he had a supermajority in 2009 as vp. He didn't codify Roe vs Wade, and only warmed up to gay marriage in 2012.

Similar to his position on abortion, I think he's okay with the laws supporting trans people, but I think he personally doesn't for religious and moral reasons. \n\nAnd lastly on this topic of consequences. Do you think any moral decision is justified on the basis of it's consequences? Would you personally do morally unjust and obviously reprehensible things to a sentient being if it meant that 1000 people survive some catastrophic event? (don't want to name any specifics because I don't even enjoy talking about it)\n\n>Most gay and trans folks aren‚Äôt Marxist-Leninists, believe it or not.  The vast majority of them are pragmatic \n\nShow your work, you can't just make claims like this. How would you determine what \"pragmatic\" means in quantifiable terms poltically, and then prove it. You can't just say that. There's no pragmatic party, there's democrats, republicans, independents, and third party voters. \n\nI asked: \n\n>Show your work, please.\n\nyou replied:\n\n>I‚Äôm only making an informed guess.\n\nPlease be serious, you cannot just take the best case scenerio look at a complex situation and insinuate that it's the most likely situation based on zero data and a guess you're making.\n\n>As for Gaza, actually, Jewish people do have ancestral ties to that land and were there before Arab people were\n\nYep, there it is. Oh my gosh, I'm a bit too exhausted to have this conversation. Gazans also have ancestral ties to the land, and both their ancestors were there before arabs. I wish you were aware of this already. Jews were predated in the levant by the canaanites, and even further away by natufians, not all of those groups became jewish, and some jewish people converted to other religions. The conflict is in zero way helped by who had ancestors in the land 2000 years ago. There was an expulsion of jews in what is now referred to as israel and occupied palestine just under 2000 years ago. There were Jews living in Israel much more recently in mandatory palestine, in a pluralistic country. Instead of living in a state with a native indigenous population, over 50% of the land of palestine that belonged to native indigenous people was handed to a group that largely didn't live there for 2000 years. This largely European invading occupation then stole more and more land. Now they have stolen about 85%, instead of just a bit over 50%. Do you think Russia should own over 85% of Ukraine? \n\nI will say, for someone who hates marxist-leninists so much, you sure do exemplify why leftist ideologies are more ethical."

(See: self-defence laws for details)  Though quite a lot of places don't let you protect others from murder attempts under those laws for some reason.\n\nAfter establishing that trading lives for lives is something that we *are* comfortable doing as a society, we get into \"Is torture worse than murder?\" and \"How far in advance of someone doing something horrible can you take action to stop them?\"/\"Is it moral to murder baby Hitler if it stops the holocaust?\"\n\nAnd those questions have a lot of monkey-brain emotional stuff tied up into them that makes doing the cold math ***really*** uncomfortable.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into Utility Monsters.\n\n---\n\nAs for my personal opinion to the answers to those questions:\n\nI think murder is worse than torture, and I think murdering baby Hitler to stop the holocaust is a morally good thing to do (I am comfortable with the line there being blurry.

Harris's campaign took the absolutely boneheaded move of trying to convince people that Biden was good and the economy was good.  The median voter votes on feelings, not facts.  As soon as she was asked what she would have done differently than Biden and she said she wouldn't have done anything different, that clip of her shooting herself in the foot was put in front of a megaphone to show people - on the left and the right - how Harris was making it clear that her plan was to be four more years of Biden.\n\nNow, in terms of policies and data and statistics, you can make the arguments that Biden's policies were good or that inflation was going down or that the economy was healthy.  But based on Biden's unpopularity - again, on the left and on the right - people didn't *like* him and elections are ultimately a popularity contest.\n\nBeyond that, the Trump campaign ran on clear messaging that \"Everything is bad and we'll fix it\" and defined clear enemies that they want to \"beat.\"  The Harris campaign ran on messaging that \"Everything is fine actually and we'll make it marginally better but not too much better and we're going to compromise with Republicans as much as we can\" and just had a big tent that they picked up and moved somewhere else, expecting that formerly Democrat voters would follow them.\n\nIt's a popularity contest, and appealing to emotions wins elections, not facts or data.  You know how Trump voters wear Trump hats and put Trump flags on their trucks and outside their houses and Harris voters just didn't do that?  It's easy to look at tribalist behavior like that and be like \"yeah that's because they're a bunch of cultists\" but you know what cultists have in common that Democrats don't?  Cult leaders promise their cultists whatever the cultists want to hear and the cultists show up to drink the koolaid.  And in what is - and I cannot stress this enough - a *popularity contest*, riling people up gets them to the polls.  Promising more of the status quo isn't going to win you voters who want change, and in a year where incumbent candidates are losing elections all over the globe, Harris - despite NOT TECHNICALLY being the incumbent, and seeing a massive surge in voter enthusiasm after her selection despite the fact that she wasn't elected in a primary because there basically wasn't one - made a massively dumb decision to decide to paint herself as basically the same as the incumbent."

Around the same time, the Montana Department of Justice adopted a policy similarly restricting amendment of driver‚Äôs licenses. The plaintiffs challenged these policies in state district court, arguing that they violate various constitutional provisions, including the right to equal protection of the law.\n\nIn a recent Montana Supreme Court decision, two justices concluded that discrimination on the basis of transgender status ‚Äì as the state is engaging in here ‚Äì is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Montana Constitution‚Äôs equal protection clause.\n\nThe plaintiffs, two transgender women, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Montana, and Nixon Peabody LLP.‚Äù\n\nAnother recent win for my trans siblings in Montana!¬†"

Luckily I was fast enough to train with the guys, but when racing I always wanted to race with the guys too. I remember always being so excited when there were coed races cause then I'd get to race with the guys.\nBut then puberty hit and I got hella depressed. I could barely function. I wanted to chase my sports dreams so bad but as a guy. The moment I got top surgery and started testosterone I finally got to run as a guy and just train as a guy. And then I got to race as a guy. Granted in marathon and trail running since its not school sports it's way easier to do so. Idk if i would have been able to in school.\nAll to say that basically the reason I was so inactive for a while was cause of how bad my dysphoria and depression was. I would train at night and in early morning when it was dark so no one would see my chest. And I knew that I had to transition to be able to chase my dreams. But damn did dysphoria made it hard to survive let alone go and exercise. But damn I worry about my right to compete in sports every day with what's going on right now."

The stance for the next 2 years is going to come down to how the Senate reacts to this, though."

And of course the spineless mainstream either doesn‚Äôt want to poke the bear or wants all this rhetoric so they let it slide and let them control the narrative. \n\nMost of these people will understand why ‚Äúgay marriage is not real marriage‚Äù is homophobic, but not why ‚Äútrans women/men aren‚Äôt real women/men‚Äù is transphobic. They understand why ‚Äúthere are no gay people, just people who have same sex attraction‚Äù is homophobic, but not why ‚Äúthere are no trans people, just people who have gender dysphoria‚Äù is transphobic. Or maybe they do understand, and just don‚Äôt want to believe it. \n\nDiscrimination and rhetoric against us is not taken nearly as seriously. We are fair game, simply a debate for cis people to wrap their heads around. We are not a legitimate minority worthy of protection. We are an ideological conundrum. \n\nThe separation of us from our transness is very intentional and I know you also see it too. For as long as there is no trans person, there is no transphobia. For as long as we are just an ideology to be picked through, there is not a thought that can be transphobic. \n\nAnd as time passes GCs become more radical, you can see it directly with Rowling and the way she went from ‚ÄúI‚Äôd march with them if they were being discriminated against‚Äù to ‚Äúthere are no trans kids.‚Äù If you look on Ovarit you‚Äôll find they‚Äôre getting more radical‚Äîless and less qualifies as discrimination against us. Our mere visible presence in public is an outrage, a direct affront to them, and our being kicked out is fair game in their eyes. And every step of the way ‚Äúallies‚Äù deny their transphobia that we‚Äôve sounded the alarm on from day one, and cis onlookers get more disturbed by US calling out people like Stephen Fry than they do by Stephen Fry refusing to actually stand up to bigotry and cut off a clearly virulent bigot. Maybe I could‚Äôve given him the benefit of the doubt 4 years ago. Now? He is not our ally and it is insulting for him to claim such and that it is our fault we do not accept him as one. \n\nLong rant sorry I‚Äôm on school break and have been allowed too much thinking time‚Ä¶ TLDR: cis people spineless"

It's actually \\*less\\* bad than it was when the House introduced the bill, and cuts out the anti-trans provisions that made it into the Senate version. The caveat that it's only care for minors that \"could result in sterilization\" is at least up to interpretation by the doctors and TRICARE insurance underwriters, rather than a specific prohibition.\n\nThat said, look for it to be worse next year."

When I first attempted to transition in the early 2000s, this was sadly the norm. I can‚Äôt speak for Mexico in the current era, but much like Laverne Cox‚Äôs character in OITNB, it used to be that if you were trans, you knew a few things for certain‚Äî that you were already going to be pushed to the outskirts of society, you were probably going to lose everything anyway, and that you were going to need a tremendous amount of money for hormones and surgery that was all going to be out of pocket, and it would probably require going somewhere like Thailand or Sweden to get it done‚Ä¶ so why not become a career criminal and isolate yourself anyway?\n\nMaybe this doesn‚Äôt align with 2024 America, where in a lot of places you can just walk into the doctor, say ‚Äúgive me HRT‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the very real, sad and desperate truth that we used to face across the board, and many people around the world feel like they are pushed into.\n\nI stopped transitioning after about a year the first time because I saw it firsthand. I saw people selling drugs, selling their bodies, stealing credit cards, just to try to feel like themselves, and in return, they lost absolutely everything you can possibly lose. \n\nJust because this isn‚Äôt your experience with transitioning doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a very real problem got a lot of people."

The same can be said for this actress but in her defense we can always argue trans artists aren't always fully employed. However even at the age of 52 her IMDb shows she has 40 credits (this one included) under her belt so it's not like she doesn't get work.\n\nWhat would it take for anyone of us MtF or FtM (GNC/NB) to walk away from a bad script and paycheck?

You can't escape your past and yourself that easily.\n\nWas the trans character necessary to the movie? Not particularly, it could have worked with any character who gave up that life in hopes of living the life they always wanted. Then found out that it wasn't that easy.\n\nIn the beginning, when the main character yearns for the life they could have had, I really felt that.\n\nAlso, it was from a perspective of a totally different culture.

She's a woman with a past who is looking to reconcile what she has done in her previous life. If anything, her being trans is just a convenient plot device to get her out of the cartel.\n\nThe most offensive thing is probably the vaginoplasty song, and even that was more camp than anything else.

What is the reason? Why don‚Äôt you tell me why you think that number is higher?\n\nFurthermore, you simply cannot compare the poor white regions of america like Appalachia to the Black community. The historical levels of discrimination are nothing even close to the same. Appalachians were never enslaved, denied the right to work, or marry, or travel as a result of their race alone. They were never driven from towns or just straight up murdered for their race alone. Not to mention in your first comment you mentioned the police have trouble reporting hate crimes so the numbers are probably higher which would also apply to those communities, especially the ones that have far fewer officers per capita.\n\nFinally, sorry but if you‚Äôre not black I think it‚Äôs pretty lame to use black trans women to try to justify these concerns. They and us are very much part of the LGBTQ+ community but you are directing these concerns at a community that you are not a member of and again, if you‚Äôre gonna come here and vaguely make assertions about how it‚Äôs not because of historical discrimination that Black men are more likely to be violent then you‚Äôre just contributing to a line of thought that‚Äôs going to be turned around on black trans women."

(If you don't have a¬†*TFP*¬†subscription, the parts relevant to what I want to talk about were shared by¬†[Tennessee Holler on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thetnholler.bsky.social/post/3lea3tityok22).) According to the¬†*Times-Free Press*¬†story, Watson‚Äôs ‚ÄúChristian faith, he said, has led him to believe that God created males and females in His own image and that for humans to modify that is a dangerous proposition for society.‚Äù And then, God bless the Holler's Justin Kanew, you can scroll down just a tiny bit in the Bluesky post¬†and see a picture of a clean-shaven Watson, with his hair neatly cut,¬†*wearing glasses*.\n\n>Y‚Äôall, I have well-reasoned points to make and Bible verses to quote, and I can‚Äôt get to them because I‚Äôm still laughing about ol‚Äô Bo modifying his body and then complaining about how we can‚Äôt let other people modify their bodies because he‚Äôs a Christian. Bo, if God had wanted you to see, he would have given you working eyeballs! How dare you defy his plan for your body with glasses. Trust in the Lord and squint, you hypocrite.¬†\n\n>And this is why I‚Äôm kind of frustrated that Democrats dropped¬†[the whole ‚ÄúRepublicans are weird‚Äù thing](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/weird-is-a-rebuke-to-republican-dominance-politics), because these folks are weird. Most adults aren‚Äôt running around obsessing over other people‚Äôs genitals and what they‚Äôre doing with them. But we‚Äôve got these weirdos in the ruling class who are apparently all still emotionally 15, and they are obsessed. And it‚Äôs super frustrating that more people don‚Äôt view these immature fools as the emotional children they are. I‚Äôm sorry that, when you were first hitting puberty and all you could think about was other people‚Äôs junk and what you‚Äôd like to do with it or ‚Äî oh no! ‚Äî what they might want to do with it, that no one explained to you that part of being an adult was learning to channel your libidinal impulses so they don‚Äôt run your life.¬†\n\n>But this brings me to my last point. Transgender people in our state ‚Äî hell, in our nation ‚Äî are a tiny, precarious, marginalized group, many of whom are terrified that they‚Äôre not going to be able to get the medical care they need to be healthy. What kind of person takes this time to say, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôm totally targeting these people‚Äù? Anyone with an ounce of empathy knows that transgender people are vulnerable and frightened, and Bo Watson chose this holiday season to add to their fear."

Puberty blockers are a medication which *pause* puberty from starting for a couple of years. They've been used for the past 40 years to treat children with precocious puberty, but now that the GOP can link them to trans children, suddenly that's a problem.\n\nHow they work is your body sends a signal to the pituitary gland to start puberty, and the pituitary gland sends out other signals and hormones that start puberty. It's like turning the ignition on your car - once you turn the key, the engine starts.  \n\nWell, puberty blockers simply stop that signal from getting to the pituitary gland. The child continues to grow as normal, but their puberty is *paused* for a couple of years, until they stop taking the blockers. Once they stop taking the blockers, the signal gets through, the key gets turned, and puberty begins as normal.  \n\nThey do this because it allows a trans kid to *buy time* while they get therapy and get old enough to make the decision for themselves. It's also *safe* and *reversible* - stop taking the blockers, and puberty starts.\n\nIt's one of the safest possible treatments and one of the most conservative courses of action for trans kids. Trans kids aren't taking hormone replacement therapy or getting hormones. They just get to pause puberty for a little bit so they can buy time to be absolutely sure this is what they want.\n\nStop listening to the fearmongering bullshit that the right wing lies about. They're full of it. Trans and LGBT people [have been found all over the globe, in every human society](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/). Biology can be messy and it doesn't always fit neatly into human labels and categories; it's *much* safer to try and help the body match the mind than to try and match the mind to the body."

Nothing will happen without a fight, and a lot of people (including people in government) are ready to fight. \n\nNext, reach out to your local LGBTQ groups and state representatives.
