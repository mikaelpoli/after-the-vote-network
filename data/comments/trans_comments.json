I walked back in with her in tow and saw different fitting booths the girl that was in there was having a dress professionally fitted \"I guess\" she looked at my friends and went to say something to me and apparently my friend mouthed the words \"Don't you fucking dare!\"\n\nSo yeah Violently supportive people are the best"

This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (‚ÄúSOGI‚Äù), diversity, equity, and inclusion ‚Äî 5 ‚Äî Foreword (‚ÄúDEI‚Äù), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists. Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.\n\nPage 554  \nEnforce the death penalty where appropriate and applicable. Capital punishment is a sensitive matter, as it should be, but the current crime wave makes deterrence vital at the federal, state, and local levels. However, providing this punishment without ever enforcing it provides justice neither for the victims‚Äô families nor for the defendant. The next conservative Administration should therefore do everything possible to obtain finality for the 44 prisoners currently on federal death row. It should also pursue the death penalty for applicable crimes‚Äîparticularly heinous crimes involving violence and sexual abuse of children‚Äîuntil Congress says otherwise through legislation."

And this was a person trying to make money who was deliberately sexualizing their trans identity to appeal to chasers. I've also seen a couple of slightly lewd photos where a person was holding one or had it in the background. It is absurd to apply this to the entire trans community, I highly doubt he would've ever come across this unless he was specifically looking for trans porn or plush-related kinks/sex acts. Plenty of cis people sexualize stuffed animals or other child-associated things as well, no reason to pin this on the trans community unless you already think transition is a fetish thing. Also if they aren't exposing children/nonconsenting individuals to it there's really no reason an adult can't sexualize whatever inanimate object they want."

So, I would very much like to know where this idea comes from. What is the exact loosly worded search terms that can be entered to give you a perfect balance of innocently looking for \"normal\" videos, that also allows you to be shocked when something extremely neish and spesific shows up.\n\nJoking aside this is a very transhobic trope that's used to sexualise us while simultaneously accusing us of pederasty. If it was a careless comment then he needs to be told to have a serious think about the damage his lies cause. If there's any kind of pattern here then you really need to run.

No. A trans person doing porn doesn't define the rest of us. \n\nAlso, yeah your boyfriend has been searching for certain porn. He is actively seeking trans plushie porn. Trans porn has been on the rise for years because of people who want to define us exclusively as kink based sex objects for themselves. It is alot more popular in deep red states where anti trans sentiment is the highest. Those kinds of people get off on a power dynamic difference one has over someone not established as a full fledged human. Its the same people who get off to black slave porn because of the power dynamic mixed with bigoted superiority. \n\nThe plushie porn bit is a relatively small kink where women tend to grind on pillows or toys with faces. Not alot of darker stuff there. Blahaj would just be an iconic toy for a trans porn star to use  for it. \n\nIf you want to help him out of that hole he dug himself, start unpacking what kind of things he has been into porn wise. Porn can lead to an unrealistic view of sex and reality as a whole. It would be helpful to discuss with him his porn habits and how it is enforcing some dark thoughts and behaviors and that maybe its time to take a break."

Later, I got bumped up to 4mg per day, because my endo says that, regardless of levels, proper puberty is rarely sustained on anything less than 4mg. So now I'm on 4mg, and I have been for, like, eight months. Keep in mind, there are girls who are on 8mg and are still struggling to reach cis female levels. I am currently at FOUR THOUSAND pmol/L (that's 1100 pg/mL for our American sisters). I'm literally at cis PREGNANT levels despite being on a perfectly normal dose. My endo has no idea what could be causing it. And no, before anyone asks, I'm not consuming any grapefruit. Fresca was a sacrifice I simply needed to make in order to transition. lol"

Your body can actually be temporarily desensitized by high levels and you will actually see fewer effects from estrogen (less breast growth, less fat redistribution etc.).\n\nYou can do a whole deep dive on it but if your E levels get elevated your body will start releasing excess SHBG which binds to your estrogen receptors instead of estrogen and inhibits their effect. So your ideal E range is where it is highest without also having elevated SHBG which will be around the average cis female ranges that your doctor should be targeting. Just wanted to point that out because I think a lot of people tend to think more is better but that's not necessarily the case."

However, the relationship is a bit more complex than a simple ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù answer.\n\n_Grapefruit‚Äôs effect on estrogen:_\n1. _Inhibition of estrogen metabolism_: Grapefruit contains compounds like naringenin and furanocoumarins, which can inhibit the activity of an enzyme called CYP3A4. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of estrogen. By inhibiting CYP3A4, grapefruit may lead to increased estrogen levels.\n2. _Increased bioavailability of estrogen_: Grapefruit may also increase the bioavailability of estrogen in the body. This means that more estrogen may be available to bind to estrogen receptors, potentially leading to increased estrogenic activity.\n_Important notes:_\n3. _Individual variability_: The impact of grapefruit on estrogen levels can vary greatly from person to person.\n4. _Dose and frequency_: The effect of grapefruit on estrogen levels may depend on the amount and frequency of consumption.\n5. _Other factors_: Grapefruit‚Äôs impact on estrogen levels may be influenced by other factors, such as individual hormone levels, medication use, and overall health status.\n\nIn summary, grapefruit may have a potential impact on estrogen levels by inhibiting estrogen metabolism and increasing estrogen bioavailability. However, individual results may vary, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between grapefruit and estrogen levels."

As I've gotten older (tho I'm only in my 30s) and my estrogen has tanked over time, my mental health has actually gotten WAY better. But at the same time, the beard is legit detrimental to my life. There are days when I feel like I just can't even go out of the house because of it. It's embarrassing. It's such a conundrum. Like what if estrogen replacements make my mental health take a dive?

For women, estrogen levels typically fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle and decline with age, especially during menopause.\n\nA serum estrogen level of 60 pg/mL is considered low for a premenopausal woman. Here‚Äôs a rough breakdown of estrogen levels in women:\n\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Premenopausal women: 15-350 pg/mL\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Postmenopausal women: 0-50 pg/mL\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Menopausal transition: 15-150 pg/mL\n\nKeep in mind that these are general reference ranges, and what‚Äôs considered ‚Äúlow‚Äù can vary depending on individual circumstances.

And I think we as a community asking to be recognized for being different and usually demanding to be labelled specially in a box of our own are much too quick to judge people and throw them in the \"transphobic\" box.\n\nBasic human nature is to fear the unknown. You overcome these basic human instincts with exposure to learn what is harmful and what actually isn't. Almost never does this confrontation happen immediately and successfully. It takes steps to progress. Like learning to swim in deep water. You learn to float first.\n\nMy parents grew up in a generation that rejected, imprisoned, and institutionalized people who were different. Whether they agreed or not these things happened, and maybe our families reject or worry because they want us to fit in the \"normal\" box so we avoid the ridicule and harassment that has and still exists. So we can live an easier more peaceful existence. \n\nGiven time, ~1-2 years my family has come around, accepted me because I'm still comfortable in my life despite transition. \nAre they transphobic for taking time to address and confront a sudden earth shattering change that directly affects a close family member?\nI kept my name, but to those who change their names you use the phrase \"dead name\" \nYou've asked your family to kill that person in their minds.\nGive people time to adjust. \n\nThey don't get forever, but the more valuable they are to you, the long they should get to recognize you are still you. \n\nPatience is always better the Pressure ü©∑üå∏\nYour grandmother sounds incredible!"

I've worked hotel front desk (as my deadself) before and it's not uncommon to have someone present a spouse's ID while they are parking a car or something and yes, we are supposed to wait for that person to present themselves. I've only ever had one trans woman (that I am aware of) check-in, the reservation and ID were both in deadname, and that was the only name she gave. My extremely conservative co-worker was just beside himself rolling his eyes as I asked if there was a different name she preferred on the reservation. After some hesitation, she gave her preferred name and I edited the reservation and added in the notes \"she/her, verified ID is under legal name xxxx\" in case she needed to get a duplicate key.\n\nNot verifying ID correctly can get front desk in a great deal of trouble and we get tested by \"secret shoppers\" from corporate quarterly. So getting backup from her front desk manager was the correct move in the case of difficult to verify ID.  I usually worked evenings or overnights and wouldn't have that option, so I had to make those calls myself.\n\nHotels and the usual business traveler clientele skew very conservative so unfortunately I was never able to come out there. Even those that I thought were close friends and that I could trust became very hateful when the subject of trans people would come up. Fortunately my next job I was able to work as myself.\n\nSorry, I am hijacking your story. But I am so glad the situation ended up being positive."

You need to start working on that now, because expecting people to be cruel to you is hard to shake, even decades later.  \n\nSome older folks do this simply because they're shitty people, this isn't an excuse, but a lot of older folks think being queer or trans is a child thing.  That the whole reason adults are queer or trans is because they didn't have it beat out of them when they were younger.  They literally think hitting you will cure you.  And frankly, it's because they're stupid, sheltered, entitled, and mean\n\nPlease tell people.  Don't protect your abusers. Tell sympathetic family."

If there's some adult at your school with whom you can confide in I recommend going to that person and discussing it. They can help you make a confidential call to child protective services. \n\nHowever, that's a big step to take and you're all by yourself in this. Maybe try giving this website a view first - [https://lgbthotline.org/](https://lgbthotline.org/) \\- It has a hotline phone number for resources in your area that might be able to give you more direct support. It also has phone numbers and links to youth chat groups where you can connect with other people your age who I am sure have experienced this sort of abuse as well.\n\nI hope you get the help you need. Probably getting removed from the home would be your best option for you at this time but that could be too much to hope for. It also could lead to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. You are probably headed for a difficult couple of years and you need all of the help you can get. There's not much more I can offer but I wish you well on your journey."

I'd talk about how focussing on the outside means ignoring the person behind that shell, how forcing me in that role they wanna see is going to move me towards suicide. Because apparently their delusion of an ideal is more important than the actual person. Call me what you want, it's just showing the darkness and evil inside yourself. And you reap what you saw.\n\nAgain, I'd be dead if not for my HRT. In the end the only people in my life that matter rn are those who see the real me, who know me, who accept me for me.\nAnd those are the only people i will keep in my life and care for.\n\nSharp words...

If there is evidence of the grandfather assaulting a child physically (at least where I‚Äôm from) the cops will not hesitate to drag that person away. Maybe where you are that‚Äôs not true but as previously stated we don‚Äôt know where they are. \n\nDo I like cops, not particularly. I have been the victim of police violence and intimidation before. But I‚Äôve also had perfectly fine interactions and have gotten to see them handle some things that regardless of their personal beliefs are not something they can skip because they don‚Äôt like the victim. Maybe it‚Äôs different where ever you live but I can‚Äôt speak to that. \n\nOp seemed to be safe in their home just not if they had to be around the grandfather. They had removed themselves from his presence and the violence had stopped for the moment at least. Therefore the street is probably not the best option. Was it for you? No one knows but you. But you are not everyone else. I could survive in the wilderness for months but I don‚Äôt know if OP could so I wouldn‚Äôt tell them to walk into the woods for safety because they don‚Äôt have the training. I know they are probably using their phone to use Reddit so they can gather evidence. And even if that evidence goes to CPS (if they have that where they live) they can get removed from the home and brought to safety. \n\nThe system isn‚Äôt perfect but using that as a reason to avoid the system entirely just perpetuates that issues. So without knowing anything about OP the systems that keep people safe from violence are still the best bets vs being a homeless teen (I‚Äôm assuming teen) \n\nAnd since 99-100 of the time even with evidence cops don‚Äôt do enough? please post a link for the stats on this. I‚Äôd love to read all of the in-depth research you did beyond your own horrible situation in rates of police inaction in cases of assault. Oh and make sure you have the stats for wherever OP is from since that is what would be relevant. \n\nAs for the wine on your dress comment, I was so annoyed at your downplaying everyone‚Äôs life experiences without knowing them that I wanted to say something mean. Rather than being actually mean and saying something like ‚Äúf*ck you, you‚Äôre a f*cking  a$$hole, go play in traffic‚Äù  I decided to wish upon you something upsetting but more of a ‚Äúfirst world problem‚Äù than wishing harm upon you.

You will find community and friendship and love outside of your family as you get older as well. It does get better.

[WPATH guidelines have accounted for this for years now](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(17)30099-2/fulltext), and puberty suppression is recommended in tanner stage 2 of puberty"

    "comment_body": "Though the edit is in place, just some quick information.  In general, taking cross sex hormones suppresses, to some extent, your natural hormone production via a mechanism that is basically that your body recognizes that plenty of essential hormones are present and so it doesn't need to produce them at the same pace it might otherwise.  Many people, however, still produce a significant amount of hormones regardless.  As a result, many transgender people *also* take hormone-suppressing medication.  (For transfems, that is usually a drug called spironolactone, and its anti-androgenic properties are just one of the many effects.  I myself take it for *high blood pressure*, for example.)\n\nThe other thing I want to correct is the perception of what puberty blockers *are* and, importantly, *why they are used*.  To start, puberty blocking is actually an edge case use of that entire class of drugs and they are more commonly used to treat certain types of cancer, interesting reproductive issues, and so on.  Their function is multi-staged but to make it as simple as possible, they discourage the body from producing sex hormones.  The do so by entirely different routes than, say, spironolactone, but the result is similar.  \n\nWhat they are sorted, the reason why they are used for trans kids is the same as for cisgender kids suffering from precocious puberty:  they aren't *ready* for puberty, yet.  They are prescribed specifically to hold off puberty temporarily while the kid, their parents, and the doctors sort through the difficult question of whether they would be better served going through their natural puberty or one governed by HRT.  \n\nBuying time is *important* because until puberty, the secondary sex characteristics do not yet come into play.  As those characteristics develop, they are often *irreversible*, or can only be reversed by a difficult process such as surgery.  An example of essentially irreversible is anything to do with bone development.  Bones don't ungrow once they grow and methods of addressing this are so wildly invasive, difficult, and painful to recover from that doing so for gender affirming reasons is irrational to the point of arguable malpractice were it attempted.  (And only some bones qualify for this anyhow.  No doctor in the world is going to remove chunks of your rib cage to make for a smaller chest, for example, given the risk of complications that pretty handily include all kinds of unpleasant ways to die!)  Bones work the other way as well.  Once they stop growing, they cannot be compelled to do so again, so if you're 26 and standing at a stately 160 cm, no amount of testosterone is likely to make you taller.  In other cases there are options such a \"top surgery\", FFS, laser or electrolysis and so on.  Some of these are expensive, specialist treatments that are difficult (to say the least) to come by.  Going through the \"wrong\" puberty gives all sorts of problems that one might want to expensively and painfully correct somewhere down the line.\n\nAnd so enter puberty blockers.  Those buy time for softer social types of transitions:  new names, pronouns, wardrobes, hairstyles, and the like.  See how that fits, see how gender separates out former peer groups, and give the essential information required to make this difficult choice with some confidence that it is the correct one.\n\nWith all that having been said...Assuming I am reading this right, HRT other than puberty blockers were made illegal for under 18s in the UK a while back.  As such, adding a specific provision against puberty blockers is, while heartless and intentionally, also entirely *sensible*.  While there is a mountain of evidence for puberty blockers for trans kids, the evidence that supports that falls of quickly as they age out and no one is particularly eager to study a question like \"Is holding off puberty until adulthood a net positive for transgender kids,\" especially when current medical consensus would tell you that holding of puberty that long is almost certainly a *very* bad thing.  In effect, if you cannot actually take that other path, the argument for buying time is, well, *moot*.  Which is to say that, shitty as it is, this is more clarifying something that was *already* the case."

All that \"unites the community\" stuff only applies to the parts of the community that are most visible. The HOA members, the PTA, American Legion (fun fact: they were the militarized part of the Business Plot and it's really weird seeing them knowing that, it's like if in 2110 there's just a bunch of MAGA clubs and it's a normal thing), Kiwanis, all that stuff? Yeah, they're going to care, sure. And the parents of the kids in that specific school, or people who work in schools. They're also a tiny minority of the community. Most folks just move on with their lives.\n\nBut the rest of the nation? The rest of the nation doesn't care. The posting on social media is performative and obviously for their own aims, as this exact post is about. They don't care about the victims, they care about furthering their political goals or getting some internet points out of it. Otherwise, it's just another day in America. Happens all the time, it's just a routine part of being American at this point.\n\nIt ain't 1999, these ain't Columbine, we've done it so many times that it's no longer a unique occurrence. Everyone under 30 grew up doing active shooter drills, and a lot of people under 40 did them too. It was normalized to all of us from childhood, it became just another part of the news cycle. We tried caring. We tried getting something done about it. It failed, over and over and over again. Nobody will do anything about it, it keeps happening, we're too disenfranchised by gerrymandering and the electoral college and politicians taking massive bribes and the ridiculous number of ammosexuals in America, so to care is to just commit self-harm at this point. So people just don't care. There was a school shooting in America, a dog barked, water was wet, and time flowed forwards. It's just a fact of life, people who *aren't* trying to use it for some agenda go \"oh, huh, alright\" and continue on with our day.\n\nAcknowledging reality isn't disgusting because that reality sucks. It's just acknowledging reality. It's normal and routine for school shootings to happen in America. Nobody outside that one town remembers Apalachee High School now except true crime fans. It's been months, America moved on before September ended. The last time America cared was Sandy Hook. Once we realized that even the slaughter of elementary schoolers wasn't going to change anything, people checked out. No point in getting worked up or calling for change anymore, it won't happen. The worst possible outcome happened, and nothing happened. Be mad about the reality of the situation, not about someone acknowledging it."

It was totally false; if anything, there were a lot of whites (including German Americans) who were massive Nazi sympathizers. \n\nUnlike in Germany, the camps weren't particularly abusive, what was abusive was the loss of freedom, the unlawful seizure of their property (basically, when they were released, they had nothing, it was all taken), and many Japanese Americans were coerced into signing away their US citizenship--birthright citizens. This last thing was fought about after the war for many years and finally acknowledged to have been illegal. \n\nGeorge Takei's family was a victim of this and he wrote about it in his autobiography.\n\nIronically, the US really needed soldiers for the war effort and they mobilized Japanese American young men out of the camps to fight in the Western Theater where they were distinguished for bravery. It's not a dissimilar story from the African American experience in WWII. Movies and pop culture these days tend to completely gloss over the segregated armed forces of WWII. Captain America avoided the issue and pretended it didn't happen, for example."

Disney is the company that put in one line that implied Loki was bi in the TV show and sat there patting themselves on the back for it like \"wow we did bi representation\". Umm, no, you just did the bare minimum to pander to a group so starved for rep that a lot of them would congratulate you on it, and \"allies\" would laud your \"bravery\" and gush about how big of a step this is üôÑ\n\nI think isabela from encanto was confirmed lesbian but they never really did anything with that other than her saying she didn't want to marry the guy everyone wanted her to, and I'll be shocked if they actually follow thru with a lesbian relationship in the (inevitable) sequel. I'd bet my entire bank account that they don't have the balls to explicitly include a lesbian relationship in one of their movies. Elsa can def be headcanoned as aroace but nothing ever confirmed that. \n\nThe unfortunate conclusion is that they have a lot of talk and very little action when it comes to queer rep. They just want everyone to tell them how great they're doing for the measly crumbs they do give out. We need actual *overt* rep like this trans character would've been, especially in this political climate, but they're fucking cowards so what do we get? Erasure. We get told that our existence is \"too controversial\" to allow adding it to one of their movies. This would've been a huge win for us at a vital time, but sadly Disney are rainbow capitalists, and since our public approval is waning it's no longer profitable for them to represent us."

I had to fight all the way to HR to be able to have my hair any semblance of long. They told me I could either be fully in the male or the female dress code on any given day, but that meant if I wanted to keep my hair longer, I would have to wear the fem uniform on any day that I was in a location that had gendered outfits.\n\nAbsolutely trash company to work for. They used to be pretty decent, but they've just gotten worse over the years, with no sign of stopping.\n\nEdit: Also, the last time I worked there a few months ago, I had to get a manager to fight HR to try and get my actual name on my ID and name tag, because they wanted to only put my legal name on them. I haven't gone by my legal name at Disney EVER, not once since I started working there in 2016 before I came out. In 2021 they put my name on my name tag with no issue, but this time they refused flat out. Best they would do is a singular letter B, which is what my name starts with, as if that's somehow less ridiculous than having a name tag with a real name that is literally shared by a classic Disney character."

(Biological and legal changes)  How far you take each is purely up to you...but will need the support of doctors for the biological pieces and possibly prove to someone you are not crazy for doing so.  Its necessary and helps you to decide whether the path is the right choice for you or not.  (You don't want a whim or phase to impact the rest of your entire life.)\n\nBest of luck figuring things out.  Talk to others about it, join a support group...these things help."

I always wished I'd been a girl but I unfortunately have a very masc appearance (largish, moderately hairy). I accepted my fate as I knew that I could never be the girly I felt on the inside. I often say to friends that I'm a cute femme lesbian (although I don't really rule out any gender, but I definitely am more attracted to women) trapped in the body of a large masc man.\n\nHowever recently (as in just the last week or so) my lovely and very supportive friend encouraged me to just lean in to who I am. So I've been exploring that more freely (I've worn a bra and panties every day since) and it's been really liberating. I feel so much more confident and myself. I do have moments like last night when I was trying on some nightwear I'd bought myself and felt great but still hated what I saw in the mirror (the male me hates my chest for being too big, the female me hates them for not being big enough and we both hate my waistline ü§£). That's something that I know that I will be working on. But in terms of \"not being trans\" I'm kind of in the same boat as you at the moment - I won't ever be the woman that I feel inside. But at this point in time I'm referring to myself as gender fluid or bi-gender. I'm not sure if that will change in the future, but just do what you feel is you"

I recommend reading about or watching some videos from Chloe Cole.  In her case, it turned out to be a combination of autism and sexual trauma that led her to mistakenly believe she would be happier as a boy, but in her case surgery did not make things better and she ultimately de-transitioned.  Sometimes puberty can just be really difficult for people with female bodies, especially when they aren't looking for the kind of unwanted attention that comes with it.  Only you know your own personal situation.  So try to avoid echo chambers and explore all possibilities before settling on a single answer.\n\nAlthough I say all this with nothing but compassion, I will be surprised if this comment is not either censored or downvoted to hell."

After the 6 month checkup they asked how my progress is aligning with expectations. I said it was good starting out, but I'm ready for more or slightly quicker results than the past 6 months. 6mg E and 200mg Spiro now. I've seen a lot more in the chest area start. They want to discuss at my 9 month check up cutting back Spiro and adding Progesterone as they mentioned the peeing, other side effects, and Spiro at higher doses harder on the kidney's. My PP doctor is amazing and the sweetest person ever!"

Choosing a time they aren‚Äôt stressed or distracted by other things, and the mood is good matters. Maybe going out to dinner?  And when that time comes, approach them as an ally in your journey.  Not an obstacle to get past. Express your need for their love and support through this, and your desire for them to be a part of it.   And help them understand that this isn‚Äôt about changing who you are- it‚Äôs about becoming who you are.  Be honest and forthcoming. If it‚Äôs hard to discuss, say it.  If you can‚Äôt find the words, say that.  This isn‚Äôt about getting their permission to do something. It‚Äôs about helping them, understand who you are.  If they can understand that, and accept it, it will bring you closer than ever. \n\nFor me, imagining how I‚Äôd approach the conversation with someone I‚Äôm comfortable talking to, helps me structure a conversation with my parents.  Maybe if you have a family friend or relative you‚Äôre comfortable with there to support you?\n\nDon‚Äôt be discouraged if you experience some pushback in the start, that‚Äôs their job. it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre transphobic. It means they‚Äôre parents and they love you. It‚Äôs their job to challenge you when it comes to life altering decisions. Its their way of making sure you‚Äôre doing right for you.  They will fear the challenges youll be faced with by doing this. And keep in mind, this is new territory for them, just like it is for you.  They‚Äôll likely need your support to come to terms with this. There is no way for them to truly relate to what you‚Äôre going through, because they can‚Äôt.  Just like there‚Äôs no way for you to relate to having a child, and the constant struggle of accepting them, and protecting them at the same time.  It will require trust and understanding, both ways. \n\nHave reading materials, or links ready to help them understand what this really is, in greater detail, or to address the concerns you think they‚Äôll have. It will help assure them that you‚Äôve thought this through, done your research, and that you‚Äôve are on the right path\n\nI hope this helps."

Even in my thoughts I always see her as a woman. But for some damn reason, and it's not common, I will use the wrong pronouns. It eats me alive for days. I just blame 30 years of taking gender norms for granted due to ignorance and entrenching the dual gender speech patterns that I now have to undo. As does your mom. Maybe.

I was so scared to come out to him, but in reality he was one of the safest people who continues to treat me with love and respect. And he is by no means a woke king.

Take your proof that u changed ur birth certificate and ID and usually they will have to test ur blood and you can ask questions. I know it‚Äôs a hassle to schedule in person doctor visits but it is the most reliable when it comes to trans healthcare. A lot of online places don‚Äôt monitor the requests, it‚Äôs sent through an automated system and calculated based on what u submitted. It saw Legally Male and it‚Äôs programmed to respond accordingly. After you go to the doctor in person they can issue you a prescription card for refills (depending on the office u choose). I am also FtM and I go to a place in TX called Kind Clinic they are really helpful. I would see if there‚Äôs something similar near u."

Probably shouldn't be giving antibiotics away so willy nilly to cis women either, it's dangerous to the population at Large for sure, but if they're giving it to cis women, it's pure discrimination to not do the same for other groups."

I really don‚Äôt understand why people still have problems with any forms of homosexuallity now that it has been a thing for so long and the actual number of people that have indulged into the lifestyle is far more then those who have not."

Amongst tgirls it‚Äôs pure discreet jealousy as an internal feeling which they show or express by competition or hate towards the person that they are jealous of. In lamest terms tgirls that are envious to others will be very petty and do things to make them feel better then the ones they are envious of. It‚Äôs sick and very depressing when we have to deal with hate from the general population and when we get around other people that are like ourselves you have to worry about them hating on you too if you are prettier then them. When will it get to a point where all trans girls actually come together and see a sister in struggle and do something about it. When will it be a time where a business owner who is gay generously offers employment to other LGBTQ identifying individuals. And I‚Äôm talking at a mass rate not just one or two in a few cities but in all cities by the dozens. When will it be live shown not just said?? When will we become unified and actively participate in advocation for ourselves and others like us? Why do I apply for a job at McDonald‚Äôs a job any friggin one can do but I get there for an interview and am refused for no reason other then the apparent fact that I‚Äôm transgender. On the other hand it‚Äôs no one that I can tell to have something done about it and maybe  some other trans women that would help me expose this. I‚Äôm literally to the point of being done with this world.. I feel like the scum at the bottle of the barrel and don‚Äôt see a way to survive in this world as a transgender woman. I‚Äôm homeless asf don‚Äôt have no family no friends who are actually my friend and don‚Äôt know what to do. I try so hard to get a job but it‚Äôs hard and unforgiving. I haven‚Äôt made the best decisions in life considering the fact that I did 9yrs in prison but I‚Äôve changed and want to do the right thing and just work a job come home to my apartment and be happy. I am smart enough to be anything but to gay to be a frighin dishwasher or burger flipper. I‚Äôm so done sorry for interrupting everyone‚Äôs peace and day but this had to get off my chest‚Ä¶"

They have also learned to go their own way regardless of what the rest of the people around them are doing so in that sense most of the people that are not wealthy as others are typically ones who deeply care about how they are viewed and seen.. this is what cause people to act according to a script of what they and the culture around them views as cool or whatever term you‚Äôd use to describe it.  It all boils down to people caring about being cool or how they are seen and viewed. It‚Äôs someone for everyone a guy might not like one tgirl but there is one for him. Facts."

Everyone is connected and a part of the whole.?when someone touches a piece of the mobile it moves but all of the other pieces move in response to it. Or maybe it‚Äôs a breeze that starts the movement. When you family members hear all of this they will each respond in their own way. Some will be sympathetic to you and others may pile on with step dad. What is important is that what you did will get everyone moving and as they move they will need to respond to each other maybe you will hear from someone, maybe stepdad will have a moment of clarity.\nJust stay calm if you can, sit back and watch the show unfold.

    "comment_body": "I don't know how much this will matter to you. But, I'm also 27 and still in school, trying my best to figure out my life in the chaotic modern day. And I had a similar experience earlier this year. \n\nSomething I learned with relationships, specifically regarding my mom, is that you can only do what you CAN do to help the people you care about understand you. But they have to be willing to learn and accept your life, your view, your difference. Even if they don't 100% agree with it.\n\nYOU can't make them be the compassionate person that you might have dreamed they would one day become. It's on them to become that person. Because, in all reality, they should do it anyway because they want to be that person.\n\nI desperately wanted my mom to understand my struggle with my body and my gender. But she could never get out of her own fucked-up viewpoint to hear what I was saying. The big point I'm gonna bring up is me having kids someday.\n\nI have never wanted kids, not once in my life have I ever wanted to be a parent. And everyone in my family has known that, it's not something I keep secret. However, my mom decided to use it as ammunition to protest my transition. \"You'll never be a father if you keep fucking with your genetics!\" yeah, that's kind of the idea bitch!\n\nHer selfish ass started going for sympathy afterwards. Complaining to me and other family about how she was losing her \"son\" and that I'm so selfish for not wanting to continue the family legacy (Which is so funny to me cause her family legacy is just addiction and manipulation. That's one hell of a legacy to be rallying for.)\n\nIt came to a head in September, On my birthday, when her and I got into a physical exchange because I was wearing a dress at my own birthday. \"YOU SELFISH BRAT, \\*Deadname\\* do you understand how much this hurts me to see you like this\" was the inciting statement. Legitimately, the moment those words hit my ears it was like a switch flipped in my brain. I let loose two decades of pent-up frustration targeted at her. After that night I blocked her on everything. told my family I won't talk to her again until she learns how to actually love her child unconditionally.\n\nLike you, I started to question if I had done the wrong thing. Should I have just dealt with it like I usually did? Should I have been more considerate with the things I said? Should I have just walked away? I don't know and I don't care. I realized that I've been putting in ALL the effort, for years, to try to help her understand me. Never once has she ever shown any desire to get to know who I AM, instead she continues to live in this delusion of who she WANTS me to be. And every time I didn't fit into that mold (which happened a lot when I was growing up) It was my fault and I was ruining her perfect family.\n\nI've realized that life is too short and too obnoxious already to be wasting your time on people who won't even take a couple minutes to learn what size clothes you wear so they stop buying you pants that are too tight. There are people out there who WILL love you no matter what. No conditions, No requests, No asterisks attached to the end of the \"I love you\\*\" I know who those people are in my life currently and I'm much better off dedicating the time and energy I used to waste on her to them and continuing to find more people like them who will accept me as I am.\n\nI don't know everything about your situation. But I do think life as a trans person is hard enough as it is in the modern day. We don't need to make it harder for ourselves by trying to justify our lives to people who barely even see past our surface level appearance.\n\nI recognize this was a lot, It's 3:30am as I'm finishing this up so I don't know how much my message got through but I think you did the right thing. You fought for yourself, You were your own hero, and I hope you can move forward with your life with a little less weight on your shoulders not having to deal with that kind of \"Love\"."

She/Her is who I want to be, with all the burning desire of someone trying to *live*. But It/Its is the part of me that retracted into the depths, the part that shields me when I *can't* anymore and seperates me from my own flesh. She is who I want the world to see someday, the outer face that makes me happiest. It is what I feel like, broken, fluctuating, less than human but also more. Two halves of the same whole.

Instead of \"what intersectionality means\" I probably should have said \"why intersectionality is meaningful.\" \n\nI find lots of people understand the core concept of \"people can be more than one type of minority\" but don't often apply the idea that \"people who are oppressed in one way, can perpetuate oppression in other ways, including occasionally by attempting to overcome oppression.\"\n\nOne of the (many) issues with TERFs is that they see (a very narrow idea of) women's oppression as the only real oppression, and therefore anything they do to make space for themselves as inherently anti-patriarchy, when their rhetoric and actions instead often reinforces patriarchy either directly (I.e. pushing essentialist definitions of gender) or indirectly (i.e. justifying the existence of womens prisons in their argument to keep trans women out of them).\n\nSorry if I'm rambling aha. I have just gotten into personal arguments with people recently who have accidentally fell into similar thought patterns and reacted badly when I pointed out that even though their feelings are valid, how they chose to express them were harmful to me as a trans women, and to trans people more broadly."

It doesn't last, and it doesn't bring out anything that wasn't latent already.\n\nThe vast majority of disabled people are not going through that adjustment period when you meet us, if they ever did (after all, some people are born disabled), and the keyword here is people. We're people, for better or worse, just like you. We're wonderful and shitty and woke and bigoted at about the same rate as everyone else. We may sometimes have been forced to reexamine ourselves and come out better for it, but there are plenty of disabled people who don't gain a scrap of empathy from the experience, and they'd have been just as shitty as abled people, so don't blame the wheelchair, blame the ass that's sitting in it."

    "comment_body": "As a transmasc person that was a medical assistant telling people about birth control: hormones take 3-6 months to stabilize, and often even longer with testosterone. It‚Äôs super common for birth control to create prolonged bleeding/irregular periods for 1-3 months before doing what they‚Äôre supposed to because your body is reacting to new hormone levels and needs to stabilize them. I wish MDs and NPs would actually explain this more so that people knew not to quit before the body stabilized and to go on an ibuprofen regime to lessen the bleeding while your body works it out :/\n\nRegarding testosterone, don‚Äôt be discouraged if your hormones feel like they‚Äôre fluctuating for a while! As someone whose periods didn‚Äôt respond well to estrogen birth control (my periods basically powered through the hormones until multiple months passed) my period didn‚Äôt stop on testosterone, even after 9 months of a stable dose. \n\nGenerally any hormone can cause emotional changes but gender affirming hormone therapy has been shown to cause enough gender euphoria and happiness that even with changes that come with unstable hormone levels generally people are much happier. Your birth control experience will likely be much different from the feeling of going on testosterone:). Just try to remember that all of the changes take time and to watch out for the dangerous things like prolonged muscle pain with an injection site and other allergic reaction responses. \n\nSo happy for you!! (This is personal advice rather than medical advice btw - still talk to your doctor about stuff obviously)"

I take 5 mg of norethindrone every 12 hours to keep it stable as possible and it works pretty well.¬†\n\n\nAlso, some progestins are androgenic and some are anti-androgenic.

My experience is that PCOS doesn't really make a remarkable change. \n\nI haven't noticed much bottom growth personally, but I wasn't like, obsessive with tracking that so I might be wrong. Either way, I'm also a plus sized person so it may just be that you can't tell cause the whole area is proportionally pretty big. My voice also didn't drop as much as I thought it might, though it did drop quite a bit according to people around me. And my facial hair growth was a little patchy (which I expected bc I had some patchy facial hair before t due to PCOS and my dad's is kinda patchy) but thicker and more spread out (used to be pretty concentrated on my neck and chin, and has since spread to a full beard and mustache). Overall the most noticeable changes are my body hair, strength, energy level, and overall confidence. I can honestly say I have twice the energy and my depression spikes (also bipolar, lol, won the genetic lottery) are shorter and less debilitating. My strength, while not at my dad's or brothers' levels, are much higher than they were and might get to normative cis guy levels should I choose to go into strength training (I can move my entire queen sized canopy bed on my own with everything on it, as long as I take it slow and don't push myself too hard). And I just generally feel like \"one of the guys\" like, 99% of the time. I will say, however, my family is more insistent than ever since I went on T that I ought to be tested for ADHD and autism. They always thought it was a possibility, but now they are for sure that I'm Definitely Neurospicy‚Ñ¢.  I also am way less emotional, though I have my moments. \n\nIdk, that's not a comprehensive list of changes, but my reply is already long enough. If you have any questions from a PCOS transmasc enby perspective, let me know."

The rest was just based on appointment availability. Where i am, it can be quite hard to see an endocrine, even having a waiting list of over half a year for some people. But i suppose it's different for different people, different doctors, different countries/towns, etc. I was quite lucky to have my appointments moved forward both times, but others might be unlucky and have appointments pushed back. Before my first consult, though, i had to go to 2 different doctors. I went to one who seemed helpful, but then she ordered a bunch of bogus blood tests and didn't refer me. That was a couple of wasted months right there. So i went to a different doctor, and she immediately sent a message to the endocrine to ask what was needed. The next day, the endocrine called me and booked me in for an appointment."

Too many alcoholics among my relatives for me to drink that excessively.\n\nSet all that up to say, my high school marching band was invited to play at the Sugar Bowl (I think) in New Orleans. I was super excited to go. My uncle talked my parents out of letting me because \"it isn't age appropriate and there will be highschoolers there\" (I was in middle school at the time). Just so happened the bowl game was happening at the same time as a family gathering and they put it on the TV. I don't do football and only was watching to see the band when halftime rolled around which they didn't even show. My Uncle says \"wow, what a wasted opportunity. You really should have gone. Why didn't you?\" I have hated him ever since.\n\nI don't really do activities where getting drunk is a thing. Getting high is rare for me cause gummies are expensive.

By simply being INVOLVED, you can be punished. It doesn't necessarily matter that your involvement is being the one who's assaulted. And especially if it happens a lot: \"This keeps happening; you must be doing something to provoke it.\" It can be a pretty toxic environment. I would've been afraid to report something like this. Especially if I'd done something to fight back like throwing something. \"Violence is never the answer.\" And they really did mean never. Not even in defense.

I learned to throw the insults back in his face. One in particular he couldn't take his own weight, got upset, and punched me square in the face. A fight ensued. I fought back, as any sane person would do, and was given 10 days of suspension for it. The other kid got the same suspension. Basically the zero-tolerance policy in full effect, showing us how terrible of an idea it is.\n\n10 days off! Woooh! Worth it. My parents tried to fight it but the school insisted it had to be that way because they think what I should have done was rolled up into a ball (this happened on a school bus, by the way, so good luck getting into a turtle mode there) and taken a beating without defending myself whatsoever.

Right now you need to bring up things trans related and slowly show her that there is nothing wrong with people being trans. Bring up something cool a trans person has done recently, then bring up something negative that has been done to the trans community. In that way you are showing her that we can do great things and potentially change her attitude towards transness. You don‚Äôt have to try and convince her all at once, just do those things periodically until you see an attitude shift. Whatever you do, DO NOT come out any time close to when the baby is due. That would make your mom feel like you were trying to take attention away from her new baby. I believe that would cause her to feel negatively about you being trans. Good Luck!"

A consolation prize isn't gonna help much if their natural inclination is that you're slighting them.\n\nSo, my advice is to find a name that you genuinely like for its own sake. It's your name. Don't compromise on it for someone else's benefit. If that name is still the one you're currently using, who fucking cares, now she can have two kids with the same name. There's a big age gap, too, so the amount of actual overlap you'll have with the new baby living in the same house isn't likely to be much."

She is having a girl and using her favorite girls name. \nYou are going through big changes too. Part of your journey is choosing the perfect name for you. \nIt's out there. You even said there are so many, you just can't decide. So its time to start making a list and really see how they sound, what they mean, and what people who know you think about the names you have on the list. Assuming you have a few close friends who know your situation.\n\nI would advise you not to ever mention the name and how you wanted it for yourself. It would serve no purpose and would be childish to want any input from your mom, as it most likely would not be a positive conversation. What could she say? That she wouldn't have used it if she'd known? She wouldn't say that.  \n\nLet your sister have her name, and celebrate the name that you choose for yourself. That is such a privilege that most of us never get. As a bonus, you will have a little sister with a beautiful name that you love.\n\nLastly, people are saying to tell your mom everything now or very soon. \nI strongly disagree. I really think you should wait until after the baby is born to tell her. Here is why: Hormones. Pregnany is a roller coaster ride with emotions. They may be extreme and unpredictable.  This could, and most likely, would make the process of explaining your deepest feelings, emotions, and truths that go along with your story much worse than it would normally be. Give her at least 3 months after the baby is born. Those 3 months are very stressful, but eventually, she will sleep and settle into a routine.\n \nTry to be as helpful as you can by taking care of yourself, keeping in a good mood, and helping as much as possible. Enjoy your sister. She may just be your #1 fan throughout life."

    "comment_body": "Okay, so... You have a choice that you need to make. I won't pretend to know which one is the best one, because I don't know you or your family. But it appears to me that you have a handful of options here.\n\n1) If this name you've chosen--the one your mother has now decided to give to your would-be sister--is really important to you, and you genuinely don't want any other name, and that's your decision, then the only thing that you even *can* do is to come out and make your feelings known. Stake a claim to the name that, frankly, you have a birthright to. She wanted this name for her firstborn daughter. You *are* her firstborn daughter. Make it known and understood that you feel betrayed and distraught at the thought of that name being taken away from you like some kind of dark fae scenario. If you want to claim this right, you *have* to actually *stake* your claim. And you can't do that without making it known. The chips will fall where they will. That is largely outside of your control. If she cares about you, and if she cares about your feelings, then she at least won't dismiss this out-of-hand. There may be conflict. There often is. But you cross that admittedly very frightening and intimidating bridge when you come to it.\n\n2) Find a different name. Your own name. By you, for you. If you're not okay with this, see option 1. You can always try on different names in your daily life with your friends. A lotta girls need to do this for a long time before they find a name in their fit. Some go through, like, a dozen names or more, and it can go on for years sometimes. It *is okay* to try on different names no different than trying on different clothes.\n\n3) Just own it and use the name anyway, and then be like, \"It's not MY fault you gave my name to my sister. You did that, not me.\" If you go this route, though, it may still help to come out now so that she can't call bullshit on you about this name later and accuse you of trying to steal your sister's identity (idk what your mom is like... mine's kinda batshit like that, so that may be my trauma talking).\n\nThe way I see it, these are your only options. But I would also like to offer my own personal experience in this arena, since my story is kind of relevant here. \n\nWhen I chose my name, I explicitly put my family into consideration. I wanted to make the transition easier for them, and I partially made my name decision with that in mind. Before I was born, the doctors were convinced I was a girl (I mean, they turned out to be right in the end, but put a pin in that). \n\nI knew that my father was dead set on naming me Saturn. I also knew that my mother hated that, but had never really proposed any alternative. So, wanting to pay homage to the cis girl who should've been, but also not wanting to put my mother in that uncomfortable position of having to call me what my dad wanted, I took Saturn as my *middle* name. Even though she doesn't have to call me that, she still hates that I did that anyway. It did not help alleviate any discomfort for her, and she does not appreciate the consideration I afforded her.\n\nAnother factor behind that decision was that \"Saturn\", aside from the T in the middle, the N at the end, and being two syllables, was otherwise COMPLETELY different from the name I'd been living with in practice for 30+ years (although, now that I'm actually writing that down... that's actually a lot more similarity than I think I realized). So I was concerned that I might have difficulty processing that name as \"me\" upon hearing it, and I was also worried that my family might have difficulty using it because it's just so different and \"wouldn't taste right\" on the tongue, if that makes sense. And I didn't want this to be harder for them than it needed to be.\n\nSo I chose the name Clara, which superficially resembles the name I've always lived with. To make it easier for everyone. So that it wouldn't feel too alien to my family. It also helped that it's a name I genuinely love. This has backfired spectacularly. \n\nMy mother absolutely *despises* it. Two visits ago, she said to me, \"Why couldn't you have chosen *literally any other* name?! I *never* would've given you that shit name.\" She also said to me that the very reason I thought this would be easier--it being superficially similar to my deadname--apparently makes it \"so much harder\". Putting them into consideration did *literally nothing* to help make the transition easier. And, if my mother is to be taken at her word, actually made it *worse!* My brother I had to go full no-contact with. That's a whole other story. \n\nThe point I'm trying to drive at here is that... at least speaking from my personal experience, you can bend over backwards to try to make your chosen name easier for your family, but it's absolutely no guarantee at all that it will help jack diddly. And it may even generate resentment and animosity anyway. At the end of the day, it's not their transition. It's not about them. It's your transition. It's about you and your identity. \n\nIf you're *only* choosing this name by default, or because you're trying to be diplomatic... that *might* not necessarily be the best reason. \"Only\" being the operative word in that sentence. Those *were* reasons for me, but they weren't the only ones. It so happens that I do very strongly resonate with the name Clara, and I feel absolutely confident that this is the right name for me. If those are your *only* reasons, though, then it *might* be a sign that you don't even necessarily fully know your own identity yet if you don't know what your true name is. \n\nHowever, that said, I absolutely feel like claiming the name you would've had if you'd been born AFAB, like you should've been, out of a sense of \"I'm trying to correct the mistake of the circumstances of my birth, and set things right as they should've always been\", is a perfectly valid reason. However, if that is, indeed, the stance you want to take, then you need to own it, you need to have conviction, and you need to follow through on it. Fully. And that means taking action, confronting your mother, and making your true self known.\n\nIn the end, only you can say for sure what the right course of action is for you. And I want to make it clear that I'm not telling you to come out or saying that you should. I'm saying \"if A, then, as I see it, B\" but it's up to you if A.\n\nPS: For what it's worth, this sister could still come out AMAB. Happened to me. AND my brother."

Have you communicated to her how unsupportive she's been by doing this. \n\nThe easy way out is to suck it up and change it but that is unfair to you. Your sibling is not missing out on not having your name.\n\nEdit; it seems like your mom doesn't know you're trans. Maybe now is the time to do so. This could prevent this whole situation or lead to a NC/LC situation. Of course this is if you feel safe enough\n\nEdit 2; I'm genuinely confused by this downvote trend. In case I wasn't clear enough;\n\nI missed that OP mentioned that they hadn't come out to OP. Hence previous edit. I was under the impression OP's mom was actively being bigoted towards them. I genuinely believe that IF OP feels safe enough they should come out to their mom before their sister is born. It will really suck having a sibling with your wanted name. On the other hand, if this name isn't that important to OP then OP should change it. \n\nNames are special, It's like our specialized trademark. If OP really loves their name they shouldn't let it be taken;\n\nMy abusive ex tried to identify with an old family name of mine that I had been using as my illegitimate surname on and off for years before I had my egg cracked. When I saw them use it on a sign in sheet next to their current preferred name I decided to start using it as my firstname. As far as ik they don't associate with the name anymore. \n\n\nTldr; guy's chill I'm human and misread the text. OP, my best advice is to either come out to your mom or choose a different name to go by(maybe your mom's second pick if family is an important decision factor in your name)."

We didn't go over for the weekend as planned because my mother-in-law called my spouse the night after he passed and requested that I don't \"crossdress\". \n\nWhen we finally got there that Monday I just wanted to be comfortable on the long drive to my mother-in-law's house. I wore jeans and a cute crop top. My bitch of a sister-in-law was already there with her four kids. She had a problem with what I was wearing, giving the surface reason that her kids \"aren't seeing people's bodies yet\". Instead of taking me aside like an adult and requesting I change privately, she sat in a prominent spot in the living room, making a scene and demanded I change loudly in front of everyone in the house. Meanwhile, her skinhead husband was standing nearby trying to be intimidating. I didn't even look at or acknowledge him. \n\nMy mother-in-law did nothing for me or my spouse, her own kid. We wound up going to a hotel like mobsters going to the mattresses. While I acquiesced and didn't wear a dress, I still dressed femme. My own mother was there and thanked me for not wearing a dress. She even knew what went down and didn't even bring it up or ask if I was alright. The sister-in-law tried to compliment me and got an icy look. I wore my best black dress to work when I got back, and would've looked so much better than my conservative sisters-in-law did in their own colorful yet muted dresses. üôÑ"

If you go, go to see them and anyone that could be offended by you existing, can fuck right off. \n\nAlso, people don't turn being transgender on and off at a whim. You either are or not. Be you.

He was not ashamed to asked for my help. He was not disgusted by her period and made sure not to blame her for an accident. \n\nHe does have male role models as we do have some men in the family (grandfather, uncle, uncle-in-law) who are also pretty great about this stuff... even our grandfather for his age, but they also all grew up around a lot of women (uncle with three sisters, uncle-in-law with a single mom, grandad had a lot of siblings, both men and women).\n\nI believe that it's important for children of any gender to learn about different bodies and what they do. I also believe that having boys raised in environments with many girls might be the first step to raising non-sexist men (my uncle and uncle-in-law are both girl dads now, sons are a rarity in our family - those girls are all also growing up with dads that know their stuff and show how men should act when it comes to this). \n\nSo if your household is any like ours was, your son will grow into a respecfult educated young man who might become very popular with the ladies (which he might come to like very much if he is/turns out to be into women). Healthy masculinity is also a side-effect. My cousin used to like having his nails painted as a child but eventually stopped. He is not a feminine guy at all now, but he is very secure in his sexuality and masculinity and if his girlfriend wants to paint his nails, she can paint his nails even now. He is also a huge ally (his gf is queer and so am I and one other cousin) and he speaks up for what he believs is right. He's also a little shit because he is my cousin and he's 19..."

I feel that trans has become an identity in itself and while I support people to express themselves however they want, I don't want to be \"trans.\" I want to be a man. My goal is to get through the awkward transition phase, to go stealth and live as the man I am until I die. People from my life before will know, but I do not want it to be my identity. I've had people call me a traitor for this, but this whole thing is about yourself and what makes you happy. So... follow your heart"

I denied it for a long time, but felt much better after accepting I am a woman. \n\nI was really afraid about not being correct about my gender, but the great thing about this step is that you can change your self perspective at any point. You cause no harm by exploring this side of yourself. If this changes or doesn't work out out, you can always grow and refine yourself. Our gender is beautiful and fascinating, and it's worth exploring!\n\nI have heard this desribed before as \"internal transition\", or the mental acceptance of your gender, and the new perspectives it will provide in your life. For me, this was the true start of my transition, and is perhaps the most important part in my opinion.\n\nHave fun exploring yourself, man! I wish you luck üòÅ"

It can be low AF (T levels) but so long as it's present you should still be able to achieve an erection.\n\nThis is things I was told by an endocrinologist. The doctor specializing in hormones, and glands. \n\nPsychology is only a PART of the equation, and most psychologists aren't as knowledgeable about the endocrine system of the human body.

The only difference is that maintainance needs to be done manually :)\n\nWith regards to having kids, it's very much dependent on the person, as it doesn't make you infertile, just less likely, and the amount it's less entirely varies from person to person."

I've read (recently) that Quebec still requires you to get a diagnosis from TWO psychiatrists before you can even have HORMONES, let alone surgeries. Also, while bottom surgery is covered here, I still need two psychiatrist's diagnoses before I can be approved for that, even in Ontario. And good luck with augmentation. It's unambiguously WAY better than it used to be. Like, we do have informed consent for HRT in much of the country now, and we HAVE eliminated the barbaric \"one year lived experience\" requirement. But we still have a long way to go. Fascinatingly, the best place in our country for trans healthcare coverage is, of all places, the Yukon. They cover everything from HRT, to laser hair removal, to augmentation, to voice training, to even FFS. If it's GAHC, they cover it there. Or at least that's my understanding anyway."

It's the fuckin' transphobes and cis people."

I'm not sure why you're acting like he's not just using the bathroom \\*with his peers\\* who are all high schoolers."

    "comment_body": "Yep so you‚Äôll need to construct a pressure campaign. Determine your target or targets‚Äîpeople who make the decision, (school board, super intendant, principal) your allies (anyone on the school board that is safe school trained or is friendly to gay folks as well as community voting age adults, any GSA or similar in the district, check in with your local UU, any local LGBTQ+ rights orgs), and your methods (public comments at school board meetings, protests at school board meetings, filling the principals/super intendants schedule with meetings on the topic with allied parents and students, letter writing campaigns, email campaigns, petitions, hallway marches, strikes, sit ins, walk outs ect.) and then you just keep the pressure on until you get an official ruling that all trans students including you can use the bathroom they feel safest in. I‚Äôd focus first on activating your high school, then loop in other high schools in your district with specific asks and direction, then start checking in with area middle schools to see if there is interest. Kids as young as 3rd grade have marched for this issue across America.\n\nAs far as forming a YSDA: https://y.dsausa.org/\n\nOr specifically go here and fill out the form if you are interested. https://y.dsausa.org/get-involved/start-a-chapter/"

When you‚Äôre in high school the 3rd graders definitely aren‚Äôt your peers. They often policed our behavior because there were ‚Äúchildren around.‚Äù Being trans is obviously not ‚Äúadult content‚Äù and teens should use the bathroom they‚Äôre most comfortable with regardless of who is around. But it sounds like this school has a wide age range."
