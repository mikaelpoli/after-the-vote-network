    "comment_body": "Repost of what I found in their plan.\n\n\n\n\nPage 4\\~5   \nThe next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors. This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”), diversity, equity, and inclusion — 5 — Foreword (“DEI”), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists. Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.\n\nPage 554  \nEnforce the death penalty where appropriate and applicable. Capital punishment is a sensitive matter, as it should be, but the current crime wave makes deterrence vital at the federal, state, and local levels.

Trans porn has been on the rise for years because of people who want to define us exclusively as kink based sex objects for themselves. It is alot more popular in deep red states where anti trans sentiment is the highest. Those kinds of people get off on a power dynamic difference one has over someone not established as a full fledged human. Its the same people who get off to black slave porn because of the power dynamic mixed with bigoted superiority. \n\nThe plushie porn bit is a relatively small kink where women tend to grind on pillows or toys with faces. Not alot of darker stuff there. Blahaj would just be an iconic toy for a trans porn star to use  for it. \n\nIf you want to help him out of that hole he dug himself, start unpacking what kind of things he has been into porn wise. Porn can lead to an unrealistic view of sex and reality as a whole. It would be helpful to discuss with him his porn habits and how it is enforcing some dark thoughts and behaviors and that maybe its time to take a break.",

I started on 2mg daily, which, as far as I'm aware, is pretty much the minimum starting dose. On just that, my levels were in cis female range. Later, I got bumped up to 4mg per day, because my endo says that, regardless of levels, proper puberty is rarely sustained on anything less than 4mg. So now I'm on 4mg, and I have been for, like, eight months. Keep in mind, there are girls who are on 8mg and are still struggling to reach cis female levels. I am currently at FOUR THOUSAND pmol/L (that's 1100 pg/mL for our American sisters). I'm literally at cis PREGNANT levels despite being on a perfectly normal dose. My endo has no idea what could be causing it. And no, before anyone asks, I'm not consuming any grapefruit. Fresca was a sacrifice I simply needed to make in order to transition. lol",

Your body can actually be temporarily desensitized by high levels and you will actually see fewer effects from estrogen (less breast growth, less fat redistribution etc.).\n\nYou can do a whole deep dive on it but if your E levels get elevated your body will start releasing excess SHBG which binds to your estrogen receptors instead of estrogen and inhibits their effect. So your ideal E range is where it is highest without also having elevated SHBG which will be around the average cis female ranges that your doctor should be targeting. Just wanted to point that out because I think a lot of people tend to think more is better but that's not necessarily the case.",

However, the relationship is a bit more complex than a simple “yes” or “no” answer.\n\n_Grapefruit’s effect on estrogen:_\n1. _Inhibition of estrogen metabolism_: Grapefruit contains compounds like naringenin and furanocoumarins, which can inhibit the activity of an enzyme called CYP3A4. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of estrogen. By inhibiting CYP3A4, grapefruit may lead to increased estrogen levels.\n2. _Increased bioavailability of estrogen_: Grapefruit may also increase the bioavailability of estrogen in the body. This means that more estrogen may be available to bind to estrogen receptors, potentially leading to increased estrogenic activity.\n_Important notes:_\n3. _Individual variability_: The impact of grapefruit on estrogen levels can vary greatly from person to person.\n4. _Dose and frequency_: The effect of grapefruit on estrogen levels may depend on the amount and frequency of consumption.\n5. _Other factors_: Grapefruit’s impact on estrogen levels may be influenced by other factors, such as individual hormone levels, medication use, and overall health status.\n\nIn summary, grapefruit may have a potential impact on estrogen levels by inhibiting estrogen metabolism and increasing estrogen bioavailability. However, individual results may vary, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between grapefruit and estrogen levels.",

For women, estrogen levels typically fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle and decline with age, especially during menopause.\n\nA serum estrogen level of 60 pg/mL is considered low for a premenopausal woman. Here’s a rough breakdown of estrogen levels in women:\n\n•\t⁠Premenopausal women: 15-350 pg/mL\n•\t⁠Postmenopausal women: 0-50 pg/mL\n•\t⁠Menopausal transition: 15-150 pg/mL\n\nKeep in mind that these are general reference ranges, and what’s considered “low” can vary depending on individual circumstances.

    "comment_body": "So I hear about the \"slightly transphobic\" a lot. In fact, I deal with it from my family. And I think we as a community asking to be recognized for being different and usually demanding to be labelled specially in a box of our own are much too quick to judge people and throw them in the \"transphobic\" box.\n\nBasic human nature is to fear the unknown. You overcome these basic human instincts with exposure to learn what is harmful and what actually isn't. Almost never does this confrontation happen immediately and successfully. It takes steps to progress. Like learning to swim in deep water. You learn to float first.\n\nMy parents grew up in a generation that rejected, imprisoned, and institutionalized people who were different. Whether they agreed or not these things happened, and maybe our families reject or worry because they want us to fit in the \"normal\" box so we avoid the ridicule and harassment that has and still exists. So we can live an easier more peaceful existence. \n\nGiven time, ~1-2 years my family has come around, accepted me because I'm still comfortable in my life despite transition. \nAre they transphobic for taking time to address and confront a sudden earth shattering change that directly affects a close family member?\nI kept my name, but to those who change their names you use the phrase \"dead name\" \nYou've asked your family to kill that person in their minds.\nGive people time to adjust. \n\nThey don't get forever, but the more valuable they are to you, the long they should get to recognize you are still you. \n\nPatience is always better the Pressure 🩷🌸\nYour grandmother sounds incredible!",

I've worked hotel front desk (as my deadself) before and it's not uncommon to have someone present a spouse's ID while they are parking a car or something and yes, we are supposed to wait for that person to present themselves. I've only ever had one trans woman (that I am aware of) check-in, the reservation and ID were both in deadname, and that was the only name she gave. My extremely conservative co-worker was just beside himself rolling his eyes as I asked if there was a different name she preferred on the reservation. After some hesitation, she gave her preferred name and I edited the reservation and added in the notes \"she/her, verified ID is under legal name xxxx\" in case she needed to get a duplicate key.\n\nNot verifying ID correctly can get front desk in a great deal of trouble and we get tested by \"secret shoppers\" from corporate quarterly. So getting backup from her front desk manager was the correct move in the case of difficult to verify ID.  I usually worked evenings or overnights and wouldn't have that option, so I had to make those calls myself.\n\nHotels and the usual business traveler clientele skew very conservative so unfortunately I was never able to come out there. Even those that I thought were close friends and that I could trust became very hateful when the subject of trans people would come up. Fortunately my next job I was able to work as myself.\n\nSorry, I am hijacking your story. But I am so glad the situation ended up being positive.",

You're mother's statement is no doubt based on having experienced this kind of abuse first hand. I'm so sorry you are going through this. If there's some adult at your school with whom you can confide in I recommend going to that person and discussing it. They can help you make a confidential call to child protective services. \n\nHowever, that's a big step to take and you're all by yourself in this. Maybe try giving this website a view first - [https://lgbthotline.org/](https://lgbthotline.org/) \\- It has a hotline phone number for resources in your area that might be able to give you more direct support. It also has phone numbers and links to youth chat groups where you can connect with other people your age who I am sure have experienced this sort of abuse as well.\n\nI hope you get the help you need. Probably getting removed from the home would be your best option for you at this time but that could be too much to hope for. It also could lead to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. You are probably headed for a difficult couple of years and you need all of the help you can get. There's not much more I can offer but I wish you well on your journey.",

So please only read further if you're ready or want to hear it.\n\nAs someone for whom HRT was a literal life saver reading \"stop being trans\" sounds like \"stop being\" or \"stop being alive\". I am not trans by choice. If I'd get my meds taken away I couldn't continue for very long.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I'd probably go full blame, shame and critical mode. I'd talk about how focussing on the outside means ignoring the person behind that shell, how forcing me in that role they wanna see is going to move me towards suicide. Because apparently their delusion of an ideal is more important than the actual person. Call me what you want, it's just showing the darkness and evil inside yourself. And you reap what you saw.\n\nAgain, I'd be dead if not for my HRT. In the end the only people in my life that matter rn are those who see the real me, who know me, who accept me for me.\nAnd those are the only people i will keep in my life and care for.\n\nSharp words... I... Worded it pretty tame here, but I would repeat them wishing me dead over being me, over being happy.\nBut hey I can be pretty passive aggressive ^^'\n\nI hope your situation is going to get better, I hope you can be who you are and if you're looking to use your words against them... I can only advise you to make a list or write it down in another way.\n\nI wish you all the best <3",

Don’t listen to your mom on this one. It isn’t your fault, and it isn’t fair for her to bring up your identity in reference to this. \n\nYou shouldn’t have been put in this situation to begin with, and it’s frankly unacceptable that someone like that is allowed anywhere near you. \n\nIf you hear nothing else tho, then hear this: \n\nIt isn’t your fault.

I’m so sorry for everything that’s happening, and I’m sorry that you’re not getting the love, affection and comfort that you so deserve from your family. You’re just being who you are and there no shame in that, it’s the world that’s insane and unloving, not you doing anything wrong. \n\nI find it extremely concerning that your mom’s reaction wasn’t to kick your piece of shit grandpa to the goddamn curb for harming her daughter over something as minor as a piece of clothing, but instead imply it was you who did something wrong, and that it would be convenient for her and the rest of the family if you crawled back into a miserable and dysphoric place. I would report them for this. \n\nI’m not sure how old you are but: If you can, have your important documents in a special place so if you have to bail, they can’t withhold them and you can grab them. They can be very difficult to replace.  r/raisedbynarcissists may be a good resource for you. It might help explain some of your family dynamic. \n\nBe brave. You’re a good girl. ",

If there’s video of him backhanding you out of your chair and you’re a minor he’s probably going to jail and if not you would have solid evidence to get yourself removed to safety. Be smart, be safe. Make sure that you keep the camera recording if/when the cops are there. \n\nObviously this will vary depending on where you live, but as I said be smart and be safe. Don’t make any moves until you’ve backed up things or gotten yourself ready. Save money, stop buying dresses for a bit so if you need to go you have money to live. Learn where the places you can go are, support groups or safe spaces. Have an escape planned. And then do everything in your power to get him thrown in jail.

My advice may or may not, in the end, be instructive for the OP, but I’m intent on mitigating further harm to them whilst prioritizing getting them to locate and reach a safer harbour than where they find themselves stuck with at this moment.\n\nCops, even with video “evidence”, aren’t going to be enough in 99 of 100 instances. (I have some hindsight for this, as well.) Cops don’t give a shit about trans and queer folks and virtually never have. The thin-blue-liners, especially these days, are more than likely to be attuned to that anti-woke world view of dragging society back by generations than they are at tending carefully and respectfully to at-risk populations such as trans folks. Other folks have addressed the reasons for this elsewhere in this discussion.\n\nSo enough with your venerating cops as “advice” for a trans kid.

If there is evidence of the grandfather assaulting a child physically (at least where I’m from) the cops will not hesitate to drag that person away. Maybe where you are that’s not true but as previously stated we don’t know where they are. \n\nDo I like cops, not particularly. I have been the victim of police violence and intimidation before. But I’ve also had perfectly fine interactions and have gotten to see them handle some things that regardless of their personal beliefs are not something they can skip because they don’t like the victim. Maybe it’s different where ever you live but I can’t speak to that. \n\nOp seemed to be safe in their home just not if they had to be around the grandfather. They had removed themselves from his presence and the violence had stopped for the moment at least. Therefore the street is probably not the best option. Was it for you? No one knows but you. But you are not everyone else. I could survive in the wilderness for months but I don’t know if OP could so I wouldn’t tell them to walk into the woods for safety because they don’t have the training. I know they are probably using their phone to use Reddit so they can gather evidence. And even if that evidence goes to CPS (if they have that where they live) they can get removed from the home and brought to safety. \n\nThe system isn’t perfect but using that as a reason to avoid the system entirely just perpetuates that issues. So without knowing anything about OP the systems that keep people safe from violence are still the best bets vs being a homeless teen (I’m assuming teen) \n\nAnd since 99-100 of the time even with evidence cops don’t do enough? please post a link for the stats on this. I’d love to read all of the in-depth research you did beyond your own horrible situation in rates of police inaction in cases of assault. Oh and make sure you have the stats for wherever OP is from since that is what would be relevant. \n\nAs for the wine on your dress comment, I was so annoyed at your downplaying everyone’s life experiences without knowing them that I wanted to say something mean. Rather than being actually mean and saying something like “f*ck you, you’re a f*cking  a$$hole, go play in traffic”  I decided to wish upon you something upsetting but more of a “first world problem” than wishing harm upon you. But you can pick whichever statement makes you feel better, in my mind they are the same.",

Threatening your life is a crime and you can take legal action to protect yourself, if it comes to that (I can advise on how if you're in the US), but at least you have some support via your kind, empathetic brothers. You are obviously loved by your brothers and that's a really good thing. Cherish that. \n\nIf you need help (financial) or otherwise, I can direct you to orgs in the US (if you're in the US) that will help you, if you DM. I'd also be happy to introduce you to online communities where you can find people who can offer advice and assistance and I can teach you how to get mutual aid and support from those communities.\n\nPlease know that as terrible as all this is, you are loved. You will find community and friendship and love outside of your family as you get older as well. It does get better. Despite everything, we have each other and you'll soon discover that other trans people will have your back. You'll find love and support in the most surprising places. Don't give up hope. Please try to have a happy Christmas with your brothers and friends. And again if you need help or someone to talk to, many of us here will immediately respond to your Dms (me included). \n YOU ARE NOT ALONE!",

I am very glad to hear that you have supportive brothers and that you aren't staying on the street right now. I know things may seem hard right now, but you got this! We all work hard to survive.\n\nAlso working towards getting your license is a good start! If you can, maybe see if you can get into therapy? If you don't know where to start, you can ask your Doctor about it.\n\nI wish you well on all your endeavors and it is almost a new year and the start of your new life, being who you are and not hiding from anyone. YOU GOT THIS!",

He'd just go right back to the same shit the next day and we'd have to go through the whole process again over the next few weeks. Apologies don't mean a damn thing if you do fuck all to actually change the behavior in question. Narcissistic parents are the scum of the earth.",

[WPATH guidelines have accounted for this for years now](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(17)30099-2/fulltext), and puberty suppression is recommended in tanner stage 2 of puberty",

    "comment_body": "Though the edit is in place, just some quick information.  In general, taking cross sex hormones suppresses, to some extent, your natural hormone production via a mechanism that is basically that your body recognizes that plenty of essential hormones are present and so it doesn't need to produce them at the same pace it might otherwise.  Many people, however, still produce a significant amount of hormones regardless.  As a result, many transgender people *also* take hormone-suppressing medication.  (For transfems, that is usually a drug called spironolactone, and its anti-androgenic properties are just one of the many effects.  I myself take it for *high blood pressure*, for example.)\n\nThe other thing I want to correct is the perception of what puberty blockers *are* and, importantly, *why they are used*.  To start, puberty blocking is actually an edge case use of that entire class of drugs and they are more commonly used to treat certain types of cancer, interesting reproductive issues, and so on.  Their function is multi-staged but to make it as simple as possible, they discourage the body from producing sex hormones.  The do so by entirely different routes than, say, spironolactone, but the result is similar.  \n\nWhat they are sorted, the reason why they are used for trans kids is the same as for cisgender kids suffering from precocious puberty:  they aren't *ready* for puberty, yet.  They are prescribed specifically to hold off puberty temporarily while the kid, their parents, and the doctors sort through the difficult question of whether they would be better served going through their natural puberty or one governed by HRT.  \n\nBuying time is *important* because until puberty, the secondary sex characteristics do not yet come into play.  As those characteristics develop, they are often *irreversible*, or can only be reversed by a difficult process such as surgery.  An example of essentially irreversible is anything to do with bone development.  Bones don't ungrow once they grow and methods of addressing this are so wildly invasive, difficult, and painful to recover from that doing so for gender affirming reasons is irrational to the point of arguable malpractice were it attempted.  (And only some bones qualify for this anyhow.  No doctor in the world is going to remove chunks of your rib cage to make for a smaller chest, for example, given the risk of complications that pretty handily include all kinds of unpleasant ways to die!)  Bones work the other way as well.  Once they stop growing, they cannot be compelled to do so again, so if you're 26 and standing at a stately 160 cm, no amount of testosterone is likely to make you taller.  In other cases there are options such a \"top surgery\", FFS, laser or electrolysis and so on.  Some of these are expensive, specialist treatments that are difficult (to say the least) to come by.  Going through the \"wrong\" puberty gives all sorts of problems that one might want to expensively and painfully correct somewhere down the line.\n\nAnd so enter puberty blockers.  Those buy time for softer social types of transitions:  new names, pronouns, wardrobes, hairstyles, and the like.  See how that fits, see how gender separates out former peer groups, and give the essential information required to make this difficult choice with some confidence that it is the correct one.\n\nWith all that having been said...Assuming I am reading this right, HRT other than puberty blockers were made illegal for under 18s in the UK a while back.  As such, adding a specific provision against puberty blockers is, while heartless and intentionally, also entirely *sensible*.  While there is a mountain of evidence for puberty blockers for trans kids, the evidence that supports that falls of quickly as they age out and no one is particularly eager to study a question like \"Is holding off puberty until adulthood a net positive for transgender kids,\" especially when current medical consensus would tell you that holding of puberty that long is almost certainly a *very* bad thing.  In effect, if you cannot actually take that other path, the argument for buying time is, well, *moot*.  Which is to say that, shitty as it is, this is more clarifying something that was *already* the case.",

    "comment_body": "The rest of the nation forgets and doesn't care. The local like 10,000 people? Eh, some of them will remember. Others? Nah, not even then. All that \"unites the community\" stuff only applies to the parts of the community that are most visible. The HOA members, the PTA, American Legion (fun fact: they were the militarized part of the Business Plot and it's really weird seeing them knowing that, it's like if in 2110 there's just a bunch of MAGA clubs and it's a normal thing), Kiwanis, all that stuff? Yeah, they're going to care, sure. And the parents of the kids in that specific school, or people who work in schools. They're also a tiny minority of the community. Most folks just move on with their lives.\n\nBut the rest of the nation? The rest of the nation doesn't care. The posting on social media is performative and obviously for their own aims, as this exact post is about. They don't care about the victims, they care about furthering their political goals or getting some internet points out of it. Otherwise, it's just another day in America. Happens all the time, it's just a routine part of being American at this point.\n\nIt ain't 1999, these ain't Columbine, we've done it so many times that it's no longer a unique occurrence. Everyone under 30 grew up doing active shooter drills, and a lot of people under 40 did them too. It was normalized to all of us from childhood, it became just another part of the news cycle. We tried caring. We tried getting something done about it. It failed, over and over and over again. Nobody will do anything about it, it keeps happening, we're too disenfranchised by gerrymandering and the electoral college and politicians taking massive bribes and the ridiculous number of ammosexuals in America, so to care is to just commit self-harm at this point. So people just don't care. There was a school shooting in America, a dog barked, water was wet, and time flowed forwards. It's just a fact of life, people who *aren't* trying to use it for some agenda go \"oh, huh, alright\" and continue on with our day.\n\nAcknowledging reality isn't disgusting because that reality sucks. It's just acknowledging reality. It's normal and routine for school shootings to happen in America. Nobody outside that one town remembers Apalachee High School now except true crime fans. It's been months, America moved on before September ended. The last time America cared was Sandy Hook. Once we realized that even the slaughter of elementary schoolers wasn't going to change anything, people checked out. No point in getting worked up or calling for change anymore, it won't happen. The worst possible outcome happened, and nothing happened. Be mad about the reality of the situation, not about someone acknowledging it.",

This last thing was fought about after the war for many years and finally acknowledged to have been illegal. \n\nGeorge Takei's family was a victim of this and he wrote about it in his autobiography.\n\nIronically, the US really needed soldiers for the war effort and they mobilized Japanese American young men out of the camps to fight in the Western Theater where they were distinguished for bravery.

Umm, no, you just did the bare minimum to pander to a group so starved for rep that a lot of them would congratulate you on it, and \"allies\" would laud your \"bravery\" and gush about how big of a step this is 🙄\n\nI think isabela from encanto was confirmed lesbian but they never really did anything with that other than her saying she didn't want to marry the guy everyone wanted her to, and I'll be shocked if they actually follow thru with a lesbian relationship in the (inevitable) sequel. I'd bet my entire bank account that they don't have the balls to explicitly include a lesbian relationship in one of their movies. Elsa can def be headcanoned as aroace but nothing ever confirmed that. \n\nThe unfortunate conclusion is that they have a lot of talk and very little action when it comes to queer rep. They just want everyone to tell them how great they're doing for the measly crumbs they do give out. We need actual *overt* rep like this trans character would've been, especially in this political climate, but they're fucking cowards so what do we get? Erasure. We get told that our existence is \"too controversial\" to allow adding it to one of their movies. This would've been a huge win for us at a vital time, but sadly Disney are rainbow capitalists, and since our public approval is waning it's no longer profitable for them to represent us.",

I had to fight all the way to HR to be able to have my hair any semblance of long. They told me I could either be fully in the male or the female dress code on any given day, but that meant if I wanted to keep my hair longer, I would have to wear the fem uniform on any day that I was in a location that had gendered outfits.\n\nAbsolutely trash company to work for. They used to be pretty decent, but they've just gotten worse over the years, with no sign of stopping.\n\nEdit: Also, the last time I worked there a few months ago, I had to get a manager to fight HR to try and get my actual name on my ID and name tag, because they wanted to only put my legal name on them. I haven't gone by my legal name at Disney EVER, not once since I started working there in 2016 before I came out. In 2021 they put my name on my name tag with no issue, but this time they refused flat out. Best they would do is a singular letter B, which is what my name starts with, as if that's somehow less ridiculous than having a name tag with a real name that is literally shared by a classic Disney character.",

I had to play roulette until eventually I got a judge that had no problem with it and approved me. Look up Ahearn Kershman if you're in the area. Those were the lawyers that helped me. Good luck\n\nEdit: Also worth mentioning. There's a form you can get to use at the DMV so that your license can use your preferred gender marker.

    "comment_body": "I get this (but other way around). I had never felt very connected with my body (and culturally I do not fuck with masculinity). I always wished I'd been a girl but I unfortunately have a very masc appearance (largish, moderately hairy). I accepted my fate as I knew that I could never be the girly I felt on the inside. I often say to friends that I'm a cute femme lesbian (although I don't really rule out any gender, but I definitely am more attracted to women) trapped in the body of a large masc man.\n\nHowever recently (as in just the last week or so) my lovely and very supportive friend encouraged me to just lean in to who I am. So I've been exploring that more freely (I've worn a bra and panties every day since) and it's been really liberating. I feel so much more confident and myself. I do have moments like last night when I was trying on some nightwear I'd bought myself and felt great but still hated what I saw in the mirror (the male me hates my chest for being too big, the female me hates them for not being big enough and we both hate my waistline 🤣). That's something that I know that I will be working on. But in terms of \"not being trans\" I'm kind of in the same boat as you at the moment - I won't ever be the woman that I feel inside. But at this point in time I'm referring to myself as gender fluid or bi-gender. I'm not sure if that will change in the future, but just do what you feel is you",

Sometimes puberty can just be really difficult for people with female bodies, especially when they aren't looking for the kind of unwanted attention that comes with it.

After the 6 month checkup they asked how my progress is aligning with expectations. I said it was good starting out, but I'm ready for more or slightly quicker results than the past 6 months. 6mg E and 200mg Spiro now. I've seen a lot more in the chest area start. They want to discuss at my 9 month check up cutting back Spiro and adding Progesterone as they mentioned the peeing, other side effects, and Spiro at higher doses harder on the kidney's.

Choosing a time they aren’t stressed or distracted by other things, and the mood is good matters. Maybe going out to dinner?  And when that time comes, approach them as an ally in your journey.  Not an obstacle to get past. Express your need for their love and support through this, and your desire for them to be a part of it.   And help them understand that this isn’t about changing who you are- it’s about becoming who you are.  Be honest and forthcoming. If it’s hard to discuss, say it.  If you can’t find the words, say that.  This isn’t about getting their permission to do something. It’s about helping them, understand who you are.  If they can understand that, and accept it, it will bring you closer than ever. \n\nFor me, imagining how I’d approach the conversation with someone I’m comfortable talking to, helps me structure a conversation with my parents.  Maybe if you have a family friend or relative you’re comfortable with there to support you?\n\nDon’t be discouraged if you experience some pushback in the start, that’s their job. it doesn’t mean they’re transphobic. It means they’re parents and they love you. It’s their job to challenge you when it comes to life altering decisions. Its their way of making sure you’re doing right for you.  They will fear the challenges youll be faced with by doing this. And keep in mind, this is new territory for them, just like it is for you.  They’ll likely need your support to come to terms with this. There is no way for them to truly relate to what you’re going through, because they can’t.  Just like there’s no way for you to relate to having a child, and the constant struggle of accepting them, and protecting them at the same time.  It will require trust and understanding, both ways. \n\nHave reading materials, or links ready to help them understand what this really is, in greater detail, or to address the concerns you think they’ll have. It will help assure them that you’ve thought this through, done your research, and that you’ve are on the right path\n\nI hope this helps.",

You're randomly, wildly speculating. \n\nIf you're here to inform, post links to unbiased articles, from medical journals and such, which list the potential downsides of HRT. \n\nIf you're here to push your opinion or an agenda, cork it. Mind your own business.",

Her excuse was \"Oh sorry I can't help but switch to the right one now that I know, it's just natural habit!\"\n\nThey are fully passing, deep voice, great facial hair, and masculine build. She's just an ass, but she doesn't pretend to be an ally at least. I rarely ever talk to her now, but I fully cut her off for a while back then. Made her realize how serious I was about not accepting her being intentionally hurtful to me or my partner, and she stopped misgendering them *real* quick.",

I was (in his eyes) the son he never had, and he was so excited when he used to take me to the gun range to teach me to shoot, or have someone to talk cars with. I was so scared to come out to him, but in reality he was one of the safest people who continues to treat me with love and respect. And he is by no means a woke king.

Amongst tgirls it’s pure discreet jealousy as an internal feeling which they show or express by competition or hate towards the person that they are jealous of. In lamest terms tgirls that are envious to others will be very petty and do things to make them feel better then the ones they are envious of. It’s sick and very depressing when we have to deal with hate from the general population and when we get around other people that are like ourselves you have to worry about them hating on you too if you are prettier then them. When will it get to a point where all trans girls actually come together and see a sister in struggle and do something about it. When will it be a time where a business owner who is gay generously offers employment to other LGBTQ identifying individuals. And I’m talking at a mass rate not just one or two in a few cities but in all cities by the dozens. When will it be live shown not just said?? When will we become unified and actively participate in advocation for ourselves and others like us? Why do I apply for a job at McDonald’s a job any friggin one can do but I get there for an interview and am refused for no reason other then the apparent fact that I’m transgender. On the other hand it’s no one that I can tell to have something done about it and maybe  some other trans women that would help me expose this. I’m literally to the point of being done with this world.. I feel like the scum at the bottle of the barrel and don’t see a way to survive in this world as a transgender woman. I’m homeless asf don’t have no family no friends who are actually my friend and don’t know what to do. I try so hard to get a job but it’s hard and unforgiving. I haven’t made the best decisions in life considering the fact that I did 9yrs in prison but I’ve changed and want to do the right thing and just work a job come home to my apartment and be happy. I am smart enough to be anything but to gay to be a frighin dishwasher or burger flipper. I’m so done sorry for interrupting everyone’s peace and day but this had to get off my chest…",

    "comment_body": "I don't know how much this will matter to you. But, I'm also 27 and still in school, trying my best to figure out my life in the chaotic modern day. And I had a similar experience earlier this year. \n\nSomething I learned with relationships, specifically regarding my mom, is that you can only do what you CAN do to help the people you care about understand you. But they have to be willing to learn and accept your life, your view, your difference. Even if they don't 100% agree with it.\n\nYOU can't make them be the compassionate person that you might have dreamed they would one day become. It's on them to become that person. Because, in all reality, they should do it anyway because they want to be that person.\n\nI desperately wanted my mom to understand my struggle with my body and my gender. But she could never get out of her own fucked-up viewpoint to hear what I was saying. The big point I'm gonna bring up is me having kids someday.\n\nI have never wanted kids, not once in my life have I ever wanted to be a parent. And everyone in my family has known that, it's not something I keep secret. However, my mom decided to use it as ammunition to protest my transition. \"You'll never be a father if you keep fucking with your genetics!\" yeah, that's kind of the idea bitch!\n\nHer selfish ass started going for sympathy afterwards. Complaining to me and other family about how she was losing her \"son\" and that I'm so selfish for not wanting to continue the family legacy (Which is so funny to me cause her family legacy is just addiction and manipulation. That's one hell of a legacy to be rallying for.)\n\nIt came to a head in September, On my birthday, when her and I got into a physical exchange because I was wearing a dress at my own birthday. \"YOU SELFISH BRAT, \\*Deadname\\* do you understand how much this hurts me to see you like this\" was the inciting statement. Legitimately, the moment those words hit my ears it was like a switch flipped in my brain. I let loose two decades of pent-up frustration targeted at her. After that night I blocked her on everything. told my family I won't talk to her again until she learns how to actually love her child unconditionally.\n\nLike you, I started to question if I had done the wrong thing. Should I have just dealt with it like I usually did? Should I have been more considerate with the things I said? Should I have just walked away? I don't know and I don't care. I realized that I've been putting in ALL the effort, for years, to try to help her understand me. Never once has she ever shown any desire to get to know who I AM, instead she continues to live in this delusion of who she WANTS me to be. And every time I didn't fit into that mold (which happened a lot when I was growing up) It was my fault and I was ruining her perfect family.\n\nI've realized that life is too short and too obnoxious already to be wasting your time on people who won't even take a couple minutes to learn what size clothes you wear so they stop buying you pants that are too tight. There are people out there who WILL love you no matter what. No conditions, No requests, No asterisks attached to the end of the \"I love you\\*\" I know who those people are in my life currently and I'm much better off dedicating the time and energy I used to waste on her to them and continuing to find more people like them who will accept me as I am.\n\nI don't know everything about your situation. But I do think life as a trans person is hard enough as it is in the modern day. We don't need to make it harder for ourselves by trying to justify our lives to people who barely even see past our surface level appearance.\n\nI recognize this was a lot, It's 3:30am as I'm finishing this up so I don't know how much my message got through but I think you did the right thing. You fought for yourself, You were your own hero, and I hope you can move forward with your life with a little less weight on your shoulders not having to deal with that kind of \"Love\".",

And a man who has never done any research about a subject, has no right to make ANY claims about the validity of its effects. He’s just a dense bigot who wants to put his fingers in his ears and say “I’m right because someone told me it when I was a kid and I refuse to admit that maybe I was wrong”. Hes missing out on a relationship with his daughter, and when he’s 80, lonely with no one to pass his legacy onto, and wishes he had someone to help take care of him, he’ll regret it and you’ll be happy.\n\nTo say that you “snapped” is to imply it wasn’t deserved. He insulted you and berated you, all you did was defend yourself, and your better off with him blocked now. It doesn’t feel nice to feel like you’re on their level, but you’re not. HIS “level” is hating human beings for just, being happy, and using 3 words he didn’t like, in a way that has literally no effect on him, let alone cause any harm. He’s a snowflake who can’t admit he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. YOU were criticizing someone who treated you like shit and wouldn’t respect the most basic part of your identity. You two are not even close to the same, just cause you were both angry.",

It would be a good idea to determine how much effort you would like to put into a resolution, and consult a lawyer about what legal options you have in your state/country. \n\nAssuming you're American; It may be worth taking a few things into consideration:\n\n* How close we are to a new administration taking affect\n* Their plans to strip away basic human rights from us\n* The length of time building and presenting a case can take (esp. In regards to the previous point).\n* What amount of publicity you're comfortable with (considering how highly visable these types of cases are these days).\n* How much representation you can viably afford VS. how much the company you work for can\n* The outcome of discussing with a lawyer the pros/cons of taking legal action\n\nSometimes, the best coarse of action is to do nothing. If you can't follow through with the above or can't do nothing, finding a new job might be the solution, but only you can decide what action (or lack thereof) is going to be best for you. \n\nEither way, **Definitely start keeping track of the details of this and any future incidents.** They might just be handy in the future. \n\nGood luck ✌️",

Not exactly “both” or “neither” but somewhere in the center of that triangle? I feel like nonbinary somewhat fits me (hence the they/them) but not fully (which is why I use it/it’s as well) \n\nHopefully this helps at least a bit!",

In my experience (as someone who became disabled in my late 20s, and has had several acquaintances who also became disabled as adults while I knew them) there is often a period of time where emotions are heightened and it becomes easier to lash out and hate everything, but it's more like an extended ambien moment. It doesn't last, and it doesn't bring out anything that wasn't latent already.\n\nThe vast majority of disabled people are not going through that adjustment period when you meet us, if they ever did (after all, some people are born disabled), and the keyword here is people. We're people, for better or worse, just like you. We're wonderful and shitty and woke and bigoted at about the same rate as everyone else. We may sometimes have been forced to reexamine ourselves and come out better for it, but there are plenty of disabled people who don't gain a scrap of empathy from the experience, and they'd have been just as shitty as abled people, so don't blame the wheelchair, blame the ass that's sitting in it.",

A lot of people have trauma or have had to go on a pretty emotional journey to accept themselves, and that can greatly affect your outlook on life and who you are as a person. Cishet people just often don't understand that because because being straight/cis is not something they think about often and it's never realistically a point of attack against them, certainly not by power structures or institutions.\n\nAnd even with that said, 99% of the time that this conversation is had its just cishet people complaining that lgbtq people are talking about their sexuality/gender in the same way they do instead of 'keeping it in the bedroom'. \n\n\"Im going to a show with my girlfriend, you doing anything after work?\" \n\n\"My boyfriend and I are going to a show\"\n\n\"Why do you LGBTQs have to make everything about being gay!!\"",

    "comment_body": "As a transmasc person that was a medical assistant telling people about birth control: hormones take 3-6 months to stabilize, and often even longer with testosterone. It’s super common for birth control to create prolonged bleeding/irregular periods for 1-3 months before doing what they’re supposed to because your body is reacting to new hormone levels and needs to stabilize them. I wish MDs and NPs would actually explain this more so that people knew not to quit before the body stabilized and to go on an ibuprofen regime to lessen the bleeding while your body works it out :/\n\nRegarding testosterone, don’t be discouraged if your hormones feel like they’re fluctuating for a while! As someone whose periods didn’t respond well to estrogen birth control (my periods basically powered through the hormones until multiple months passed) my period didn’t stop on testosterone, even after 9 months of a stable dose. \n\nGenerally any hormone can cause emotional changes but gender affirming hormone therapy has been shown to cause enough gender euphoria and happiness that even with changes that come with unstable hormone levels generally people are much happier. Your birth control experience will likely be much different from the feeling of going on testosterone:). Just try to remember that all of the changes take time and to watch out for the dangerous things like prolonged muscle pain with an injection site and other allergic reaction responses. \n\nSo happy for you!! (This is personal advice rather than medical advice btw - still talk to your doctor about stuff obviously)",

My experience is that PCOS doesn't really make a remarkable change. \n\nI haven't noticed much bottom growth personally, but I wasn't like, obsessive with tracking that so I might be wrong. Either way, I'm also a plus sized person so it may just be that you can't tell cause the whole area is proportionally pretty big. My voice also didn't drop as much as I thought it might, though it did drop quite a bit according to people around me. And my facial hair growth was a little patchy (which I expected bc I had some patchy facial hair before t due to PCOS and my dad's is kinda patchy) but thicker and more spread out (used to be pretty concentrated on my neck and chin, and has since spread to a full beard and mustache). Overall the most noticeable changes are my body hair, strength, energy level, and overall confidence. I can honestly say I have twice the energy and my depression spikes (also bipolar, lol, won the genetic lottery) are shorter and less debilitating. My strength, while not at my dad's or brothers' levels, are much higher than they were and might get to normative cis guy levels should I choose to go into strength training (I can move my entire queen sized canopy bed on my own with everything on it, as long as I take it slow and don't push myself too hard). And I just generally feel like \"one of the guys\" like, 99% of the time. I will say, however, my family is more insistent than ever since I went on T that I ought to be tested for ADHD and autism. They always thought it was a possibility, but now they are for sure that I'm Definitely Neurospicy™.  I also am way less emotional, though I have my moments. \n\nIdk, that's not a comprehensive list of changes, but my reply is already long enough. If you have any questions from a PCOS transmasc enby perspective, let me know.",

The rest was just based on appointment availability. Where i am, it can be quite hard to see an endocrine, even having a waiting list of over half a year for some people. But i suppose it's different for different people, different doctors, different countries/towns, etc. I was quite lucky to have my appointments moved forward both times, but others might be unlucky and have appointments pushed back. Before my first consult, though, i had to go to 2 different doctors. I went to one who seemed helpful, but then she ordered a bunch of bogus blood tests and didn't refer me. That was a couple of wasted months right there. So i went to a different doctor, and she immediately sent a message to the endocrine to ask what was needed. The next day, the endocrine called me and booked me in for an appointment.",

But it does make it feel more enthused when I do exercise if that makes sense? \n\nI think my insulin resistance is still very much there like it was before. It’s kind of hard to tell because I have some other health issues that are probably contributing to the insulin problem.

I was super excited to go. My uncle talked my parents out of letting me because \"it isn't age appropriate and there will be highschoolers there\" (I was in middle school at the time). Just so happened the bowl game was happening at the same time as a family gathering and they put it on the TV. I don't do football and only was watching to see the band when halftime rolled around which they didn't even show. My Uncle says \"wow, what a wasted opportunity. You really should have gone. Why didn't you?\" I have hated him ever since.\n\nI don't really do activities where getting drunk is a thing. Getting high is rare for me cause gummies are expensive.

If this is the US the \"no tolerance\" policies means she'll get punished.\n\nOver 15 years ago I had a bully whom kept insulting me (I didn't know I was trans at the time, I was just obese which is an extremely easy target) and everyone around me would laugh. I learned to throw the insults back in his face. One in particular he couldn't take his own weight, got upset, and punched me square in the face. A fight ensued. I fought back, as any sane person would do, and was given 10 days of suspension for it. The other kid got the same suspension. Basically the zero-tolerance policy in full effect, showing us how terrible of an idea it is.\n\n10 days off! Woooh! Worth it. My parents tried to fight it but the school insisted it had to be that way because they think what I should have done was rolled up into a ball (this happened on a school bus, by the way, so good luck getting into a turtle mode there) and taken a beating without defending myself whatsoever. Because that's a smart call in a high school environment - said no one ever.\n\nReport the roommate, OP. Take the punishment, if your school is like mine, with pride.

Play around with some other options, use those names online and see which ones you are more comfortable with. You don’t need to figure your name out yet, that’s a problem for future you. Right now you need to bring up things trans related and slowly show her that there is nothing wrong with people being trans. Bring up something cool a trans person has done recently, then bring up something negative that has been done to the trans community. In that way you are showing her that we can do great things and potentially change her attitude towards transness. You don’t have to try and convince her all at once, just do those things periodically until you see an attitude shift. Whatever you do, DO NOT come out any time close to when the baby is due. That would make your mom feel like you were trying to take attention away from her new baby. I believe that would cause her to feel negatively about you being trans. Good Luck!",

A consolation prize isn't gonna help much if their natural inclination is that you're slighting them.\n\nSo, my advice is to find a name that you genuinely like for its own sake. It's your name. Don't compromise on it for someone else's benefit. If that name is still the one you're currently using, who fucking cares, now she can have two kids with the same name.

My mom and I have had our ups and downs, although it sounds like your mom is less accepting than mine was by a pretty wide margin. My mom is just an ignorant conservative, not actively transphobic. (just inadvertently).\n\nHonestly, I kind of regret choosing that name to soften the blow. It didn't matter to her nearly as much as it mattered to me. In my opinion, you should choose whatever name YOU want, and leave her out of it entirely. If that's the name you want, fine! But don't do it for her, do it for you.",

    "comment_body": "It's interesting to me how many people are saying to use the name.\n\nYour mom picked out that name before you were born to use for a daughter if she ever had one. \nYou haven't been able to tell her about yourself yet, so she does not think of you as her daughter. She is having a girl and using her favorite girls name. \nYou are going through big changes too. Part of your journey is choosing the perfect name for you. \nIt's out there. You even said there are so many, you just can't decide. So its time to start making a list and really see how they sound, what they mean, and what people who know you think about the names you have on the list. Assuming you have a few close friends who know your situation.\n\nI would advise you not to ever mention the name and how you wanted it for yourself. It would serve no purpose and would be childish to want any input from your mom, as it most likely would not be a positive conversation. What could she say? That she wouldn't have used it if she'd known? She wouldn't say that.  \n\nLet your sister have her name, and celebrate the name that you choose for yourself. That is such a privilege that most of us never get. As a bonus, you will have a little sister with a beautiful name that you love.\n\nLastly, people are saying to tell your mom everything now or very soon. \nI strongly disagree. I really think you should wait until after the baby is born to tell her. Here is why: Hormones. Pregnany is a roller coaster ride with emotions. They may be extreme and unpredictable.  This could, and most likely, would make the process of explaining your deepest feelings, emotions, and truths that go along with your story much worse than it would normally be. Give her at least 3 months after the baby is born. Those 3 months are very stressful, but eventually, she will sleep and settle into a routine.\n \nTry to be as helpful as you can by taking care of yourself, keeping in a good mood, and helping as much as possible. Enjoy your sister. She may just be your #1 fan throughout life.",

That made my decision easy (and my choice didn’t get complicated like yours—she had another baby, but he didn’t get named RuthAnn either).\n\nAnother possibility: try to find out if she worked from a list of choices and maybe has a second or third choice for a girl’s name.\n\nMy mom said she hadn’t thought of a middle name for me (she was never given a middle name), so I chose to use my dad’s mother’s name as my middle name.\n\nAnyway, sorry to hear about this curveball thrown your way.",

    "comment_body": "Okay, so... You have a choice that you need to make. I won't pretend to know which one is the best one, because I don't know you or your family. But it appears to me that you have a handful of options here.\n\n1) If this name you've chosen--the one your mother has now decided to give to your would-be sister--is really important to you, and you genuinely don't want any other name, and that's your decision, then the only thing that you even *can* do is to come out and make your feelings known. Stake a claim to the name that, frankly, you have a birthright to. She wanted this name for her firstborn daughter. You *are* her firstborn daughter. Make it known and understood that you feel betrayed and distraught at the thought of that name being taken away from you like some kind of dark fae scenario. If you want to claim this right, you *have* to actually *stake* your claim. And you can't do that without making it known. The chips will fall where they will. That is largely outside of your control. If she cares about you, and if she cares about your feelings, then she at least won't dismiss this out-of-hand. There may be conflict. There often is. But you cross that admittedly very frightening and intimidating bridge when you come to it.\n\n2) Find a different name. Your own name. By you, for you. If you're not okay with this, see option 1. You can always try on different names in your daily life with your friends. A lotta girls need to do this for a long time before they find a name in their fit. Some go through, like, a dozen names or more, and it can go on for years sometimes. It *is okay* to try on different names no different than trying on different clothes.\n\n3) Just own it and use the name anyway, and then be like, \"It's not MY fault you gave my name to my sister. You did that, not me.\" If you go this route, though, it may still help to come out now so that she can't call bullshit on you about this name later and accuse you of trying to steal your sister's identity (idk what your mom is like... mine's kinda batshit like that, so that may be my trauma talking).\n\nThe way I see it, these are your only options. But I would also like to offer my own personal experience in this arena, since my story is kind of relevant here. \n\nWhen I chose my name, I explicitly put my family into consideration. I wanted to make the transition easier for them, and I partially made my name decision with that in mind. Before I was born, the doctors were convinced I was a girl (I mean, they turned out to be right in the end, but put a pin in that). \n\nI knew that my father was dead set on naming me Saturn. I also knew that my mother hated that, but had never really proposed any alternative. So, wanting to pay homage to the cis girl who should've been, but also not wanting to put my mother in that uncomfortable position of having to call me what my dad wanted, I took Saturn as my *middle* name. Even though she doesn't have to call me that, she still hates that I did that anyway. It did not help alleviate any discomfort for her, and she does not appreciate the consideration I afforded her.\n\nAnother factor behind that decision was that \"Saturn\", aside from the T in the middle, the N at the end, and being two syllables, was otherwise COMPLETELY different from the name I'd been living with in practice for 30+ years (although, now that I'm actually writing that down... that's actually a lot more similarity than I think I realized). So I was concerned that I might have difficulty processing that name as \"me\" upon hearing it, and I was also worried that my family might have difficulty using it because it's just so different and \"wouldn't taste right\" on the tongue, if that makes sense. And I didn't want this to be harder for them than it needed to be.\n\nSo I chose the name Clara, which superficially resembles the name I've always lived with. To make it easier for everyone. So that it wouldn't feel too alien to my family. It also helped that it's a name I genuinely love. This has backfired spectacularly. \n\nMy mother absolutely *despises* it. Two visits ago, she said to me, \"Why couldn't you have chosen *literally any other* name?! I *never* would've given you that shit name.\" She also said to me that the very reason I thought this would be easier--it being superficially similar to my deadname--apparently makes it \"so much harder\". Putting them into consideration did *literally nothing* to help make the transition easier. And, if my mother is to be taken at her word, actually made it *worse!* My brother I had to go full no-contact with. That's a whole other story. \n\nThe point I'm trying to drive at here is that... at least speaking from my personal experience, you can bend over backwards to try to make your chosen name easier for your family, but it's absolutely no guarantee at all that it will help jack diddly. And it may even generate resentment and animosity anyway. At the end of the day, it's not their transition. It's not about them. It's your transition. It's about you and your identity. \n\nIf you're *only* choosing this name by default, or because you're trying to be diplomatic... that *might* not necessarily be the best reason. \"Only\" being the operative word in that sentence. Those *were* reasons for me, but they weren't the only ones. It so happens that I do very strongly resonate with the name Clara, and I feel absolutely confident that this is the right name for me. If those are your *only* reasons, though, then it *might* be a sign that you don't even necessarily fully know your own identity yet if you don't know what your true name is. \n\nHowever, that said, I absolutely feel like claiming the name you would've had if you'd been born AFAB, like you should've been, out of a sense of \"I'm trying to correct the mistake of the circumstances of my birth, and set things right as they should've always been\", is a perfectly valid reason. However, if that is, indeed, the stance you want to take, then you need to own it, you need to have conviction, and you need to follow through on it. Fully. And that means taking action, confronting your mother, and making your true self known.\n\nIn the end, only you can say for sure what the right course of action is for you. And I want to make it clear that I'm not telling you to come out or saying that you should. I'm saying \"if A, then, as I see it, B\" but it's up to you if A.\n\nPS: For what it's worth, this sister could still come out AMAB. Happened to me. AND my brother.",

This could prevent this whole situation or lead to a NC/LC situation. Of course this is if you feel safe enough\n\nEdit 2; I'm genuinely confused by this downvote trend. In case I wasn't clear enough;\n\nI missed that OP mentioned that they hadn't come out to OP. Hence previous edit. I was under the impression OP's mom was actively being bigoted towards them. I genuinely believe that IF OP feels safe enough they should come out to their mom before their sister is born. It will really suck having a sibling with your wanted name. On the other hand, if this name isn't that important to OP then OP should change it. \n\nNames are special, It's like our specialized trademark. If OP really loves their name they shouldn't let it be taken;\n\nMy abusive ex tried to identify with an old family name of mine that I had been using as my illegitimate surname on and off for years before I had my egg cracked. When I saw them use it on a sign in sheet next to their current preferred name I decided to start using it as my firstname. As far as ik they don't associate with the name anymore. \n\n\nTldr; guy's chill I'm human and misread the text. OP, my best advice is to either come out to your mom or choose a different name to go by(maybe your mom's second pick if family is an important decision factor in your name).",

We didn't go over for the weekend as planned because my mother-in-law called my spouse the night after he passed and requested that I don't \"crossdress\". \n\nWhen we finally got there that Monday I just wanted to be comfortable on the long drive to my mother-in-law's house. I wore jeans and a cute crop top. My bitch of a sister-in-law was already there with her four kids. She had a problem with what I was wearing, giving the surface reason that her kids \"aren't seeing people's bodies yet\". Instead of taking me aside like an adult and requesting I change privately, she sat in a prominent spot in the living room, making a scene and demanded I change loudly in front of everyone in the house. Meanwhile, her skinhead husband was standing nearby trying to be intimidating. I didn't even look at or acknowledge him. \n\nMy mother-in-law did nothing for me or my spouse, her own kid. We wound up going to a hotel like mobsters going to the mattresses. While I acquiesced and didn't wear a dress, I still dressed femme. My own mother was there and thanked me for not wearing a dress. She even knew what went down and didn't even bring it up or ask if I was alright. The sister-in-law tried to compliment me and got an icy look. I wore my best black dress to work when I got back, and would've looked so much better than my conservative sisters-in-law did in their own colorful yet muted dresses. 🙄",

They’d rather you honor them and yourself by showing up to the funeral as your true self. If anything, I’m sure you showing up proud and true would make their afterlife. Heck, I’m tempted to wish I could join you. That’s a euphoric memory waiting to happen. Not saying it wouldn’t cause drama, but the amount of pride and honor you’d get from that is a trans take I’d love to hear. \n\nGrab your most fancy dress and show them bigots you’re not afraid of them. If you let them win here, at a funeral of a pro trans friend of yours at that, they’ll push even harder in the future. If it’s anytime to take a stand, this is it. \n\nNow go take your stand and let us know how it goes.\n\n**Side note:**\n\nIf your parents do not defend you in the face of any drama or worst, use this in the future to call them out. They’d rather love bigots more than they’d love and defend their own child. They should be ashamed. \n\nFor what it’s worth I’m proud of you.\n\n**Side note 2:**\n\nCommas and periods love.

He was not ashamed to asked for my help. He was not disgusted by her period and made sure not to blame her for an accident. \n\nHe does have male role models as we do have some men in the family (grandfather, uncle, uncle-in-law) who are also pretty great about this stuff... even our grandfather for his age, but they also all grew up around a lot of women (uncle with three sisters, uncle-in-law with a single mom, grandad had a lot of siblings, both men and women).\n\nI believe that it's important for children of any gender to learn about different bodies and what they do. I also believe that having boys raised in environments with many girls might be the first step to raising non-sexist men (my uncle and uncle-in-law are both girl dads now, sons are a rarity in our family - those girls are all also growing up with dads that know their stuff and show how men should act when it comes to this). \n\nSo if your household is any like ours was, your son will grow into a respecfult educated young man who might become very popular with the ladies (which he might come to like very much if he is/turns out to be into women). Healthy masculinity is also a side-effect. My cousin used to like having his nails painted as a child but eventually stopped. He is not a feminine guy at all now, but he is very secure in his sexuality and masculinity and if his girlfriend wants to paint his nails, she can paint his nails even now. He is also a huge ally (his gf is queer and so am I and one other cousin) and he speaks up for what he believs is right. He's also a little shit because he is my cousin and he's 19...",

I denied it for a long time, but felt much better after accepting I am a woman. \n\nI was really afraid about not being correct about my gender, but the great thing about this step is that you can change your self perspective at any point. You cause no harm by exploring this side of yourself. If this changes or doesn't work out out, you can always grow and refine yourself. Our gender is beautiful and fascinating, and it's worth exploring!\n\nI have heard this desribed before as \"internal transition\", or the mental acceptance of your gender, and the new perspectives it will provide in your life. For me, this was the true start of my transition, and is perhaps the most important part in my opinion.\n\nHave fun exploring yourself, man! I wish you luck 😁",

I had to deal with a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with schizophrenia bc I told him I was ftm, and sent me to a long term mental facility (thankfully they realized pretty quick I didn’t need to be there but five days of that was enough, especially as this facility was known for patient abuse especially for their LGBTQ youth). Please remember you don’t need a diagnosis to be considered “trans enough” but of course if you want to seek professional guidance please do so, but try and look on google or see if you can find any trans folks in your area who have found good professionals to go to. Your identity is completely valid despite others telling you it’s not. I really hope you can find someone who supports you and can help you find the resources you need. Best of luck 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼",

Some countries have it written in bigoted laws to try to de trans people or convince them they’re not trans, so I’m not sure if those options are even viable. Like currently Russia it’s illegal to help someone wanting to transition if I understand right, or even talk to them about it being an option.  Something about LGBT propaganda or some crap. So not knowing where you’re located I don’t know if I have any reasonable advise about how to handle your psychiatrist.\n\nThat said everything she told you is hot pseudoscientific garbage, and I’d venture you’re better off without a psychiatrist than staying with her. Every credible statistic suggests that self led professional guided transition is the best practice for trans people.\n\nI won’t say there’s 0 risks with HRT though. There’s risks to any drug.

It can be low AF (T levels) but so long as it's present you should still be able to achieve an erection.\n\nThis is things I was told by an endocrinologist. The doctor specializing in hormones, and glands. \n\nPsychology is only a PART of the equation, and most psychologists aren't as knowledgeable about the endocrine system of the human body.

I'm in Ontario, so it IS like that here (thank frig), but, as far as I understand it, at least Quebec and Alberta don't operate on informed consent. I've read (recently) that Quebec still requires you to get a diagnosis from TWO psychiatrists before you can even have HORMONES, let alone surgeries. Also, while bottom surgery is covered here, I still need two psychiatrist's diagnoses before I can be approved for that, even in Ontario. And good luck with augmentation. It's unambiguously WAY better than it used to be. Like, we do have informed consent for HRT in much of the country now, and we HAVE eliminated the barbaric \"one year lived experience\" requirement. But we still have a long way to go. Fascinatingly, the best place in our country for trans healthcare coverage is, of all places, the Yukon. They cover everything from HRT, to laser hair removal, to augmentation, to voice training, to even FFS. If it's GAHC, they cover it there. Or at least that's my understanding anyway.",

Determine your target or targets—people who make the decision, (school board, super intendant, principal) your allies (anyone on the school board that is safe school trained or is friendly to gay folks as well as community voting age adults, any GSA or similar in the district, check in with your local UU, any local LGBTQ+ rights orgs), and your methods (public comments at school board meetings, protests at school board meetings, filling the principals/super intendants schedule with meetings on the topic with allied parents and students, letter writing campaigns, email campaigns, petitions, hallway marches, strikes, sit ins, walk outs ect.) and then you just keep the pressure on until you get an official ruling that all trans students including you can use the bathroom they feel safest in. I’d focus first on activating your high school, then loop in other high schools in your district with specific asks and direction, then start checking in with area middle schools to see if there is interest. Kids as young as 3rd grade have marched for this issue across America.\n\nAs far as forming a YSDA: https://y.dsausa.org/\n\nOr specifically go here and fill out the form if you are interested. https://y.dsausa.org/get-involved/start-a-chapter/",
