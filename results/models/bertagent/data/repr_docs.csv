>The most direct impact comes from Section 530, which protects organizations and individuals who hold religious beliefs about marriage being between ""one man and one woman."" This provision could affect transgender people in several ways:
First, organizations receiving federal funding could potentially cite religious beliefs to deny services to transgender individuals while still maintaining their federal support. This might affect access to:

>* Healthcare services at religious hospitals or clinics

>* Housing assistance through religious charities

>* Employment services through faith-based organizations

>* Educational opportunities at religious institutions

>* Social services provided by religious organizations

>The bill's restrictions on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs (Sections 533-534) could also have substantial effects. By prohibiting funding for these initiatives, the bill might limit:

>* Workplace training about transgender inclusion

>* Programs designed to prevent discrimination

>* Resources for supporting transgender federal employees

>* Guidelines for inclusive practices in federally-funded programs

>* Educational materials about gender identity

>Section 536's prohibition on teaching about discrimination based on sex could affect training and education about transgender rights and experiences. This might impact:

>* Healthcare provider education about transgender healthcare needs

>* Workplace training about gender identity discrimination

>* Educational programs about gender diversity

>* Professional development for federal employees about inclusive practices

>The bill's broader impact on healthcare access and civil rights protections is more subtle but potentially far-reaching. By limiting federal agencies' ability to implement equity initiatives, it could affect:

>* Development of transgender-inclusive healthcare policies

>* Enforcement of non-discrimination protections

>* Collection of data about transgender health disparities

>* Research into transgender healthcare needs

>* Implementation of inclusive workplace policies

>Furthermore, the provision protecting religious beliefs about marriage could create a framework where organizations can more easily deny recognition of transgender individuals' gender identity while still receiving federal support. This could affect:

>* Name and gender marker recognition

>* Access to gender-appropriate facilities

>* Coverage of transition-related healthcare

>* Recognition of marriages involving transgender spouses

>It's important to understand that these effects would primarily operate through indirect mechanisms - by shaping how federal funds can be used and what kinds of programs can be supported - rather than through direct restrictions on transgender rights. The impact would likely be felt most strongly in situations where federal funding intersects with religious organizations' services or where federal agencies' ability to implement inclusive policies is constrained by the bill's restrictions on diversity and equity initiatives.

Skimmed the actual text and it seems to fit. So just reductions in stuff we expected, but not an all out ban on care."
0,"Aside from how condesceing this comment is, I would like to ask one thing: what do you propose then? Clearly liberals are a great evil upon this country, so do you suggest communism?

While we’re discussing the historical merits of certain ideologies, are you aware of the fact that communists have a far greater track record of facilitating fascism and extreme social conservatism than liberals? Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Winter War. Mao’s China. Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge. An alliance with Idi Amin. Nicolae Ceaușescu, Enver Hoxha, Slobodan Milošević. I mean how is it that Vladimir Putin, the world’s number one fascist at the moment, was allowed to join the Communist Party and grow influential within it then? 

Because it’s politics. Ask any non-queer communist this question and you’ll see what I mean: “If you could usher in a communist form of governance, but on the condition that the harshest anti-gay and anti-trans measures were implemented, would you do it?” I guarantee most of them would say yes. What about a question about something else, then? “If you could remove Israel from the middle east and give all the land to Palestine in exchange for the harshest anti-trans and anti-gay laws in the US, would you do it?” If the person is not queer, they probably will say yes.

Because there is always an issue that someone cares more about. Liberals, fascists, conservatives, progressives, communists, anarchists. EVERYONE. Why is there a hatred only for one? Stop presenting liberals as some deplorables that cannot be trusted. 

So now back to this bill. Do you imagine the DAMAGE that Trump is going to do to America’s global standing? This bill funds the military through 2025. It gives Trump one less year to fuck around with the military. This bill needed to pass. You give the GOP and free pass for weaponising this fact but not liberals for voting for it, when both are just playing politics. I don’t get it. I’m not defending liberals, but why such a hatred in here? I’m more progressive than them, but I believe most liberals are good people at heart. I can say the same for most progressives, but not for most socialists, communists, fascists, and conservatives. 

You telling the commenter you replied to—ever so rudely I might add, a fact that pisses me off and makes me want to be rude—to go read about political history when you know next to nothing about political theory is a bit rich, don’t you think? Liberals are not throwing us under the bus. Not yet, anyways. That would look more like them *proposing* anti-trans legislation to win over voters or advance a certain policy. I understand that you see the writing on the wall. But that plays into political theory too. You, and so many others, are striking pre-emptively. Abandoning reasonable politics for extremist ideologies that are so much worse and less likely to succeed. That means that almost every elected politician will care less about you, because your vote doesn’t matter to them. That’s politics. Go learn about that. You’ll learn a LOT that didn’t get taught to you in school."
0,"I've been helping a lot of people get coverage, and the answer is... it depends.

Access to gender affirming care has never been explicitly codified on a federal level. Rather, in the past, we only had federal access to gender affirming care due to executive orders that *expanded* access by interpreting the ACA non-discrimination clauses to include gender identity. However, **the Supreme Court ruling on the Chevron deference has already removed the right to gender affirming care on a national level**. That doesn't mean access to gender affirming care is gone completely.

The way the US is set up, individual states have relatively strong rights/powers. Yes, the republicans have majority in all 3 federal branches. Yes, the checks and balances are now broken on a national level. However, there's a last check and balance - Federalism means that state rights are very strong compared to other historical empires. So much so, that the government is very good at doing nothing at all by design.

In order to ban gender affirming care, they'd have to go through one of two likely pathways:

1. Withholding federal funds to financially pressure states to change their laws. This will likely get tied up in the courts.
2. Pass a new federal law banning gender affirming care. In a typical political climate, this simply be impossible as a **super majority** is required to pass the law, due to the filibuster. However, it's possible a unified GOP could use the ""nuclear option"", to rush through a bill, as they did to appoint Supreme Court justices in the last Trump administration.

**If gender affirming care is banned federally, it doesn't mean access would necessarily be cut off.** It's possible for a state like California to enact a sanctuary policy, ordering law enforcement and courts to refuse to enforce it - the same way such policies already exist to protect trans youth. However, it's possible many doctors may refuse to provide treatment due to fear of federal prosecution, and it's possible insurance policies will no longer cover treatment."
0,">Well, obviously, you’re not a consequentialist.

I would say that we're focused on two different sets of consequences. To cut to the chase with an example: If an enslaved person argues for a slave revolt. The punishent if the group fails is bad. If the succeed and achieve freedom for themselves, the result is no more enslavement. In your mind, do you think it's ethically superior to stay slaves, or attempt freedom? You might argue that the punishment is the realistic consequence, so slaves should never seek freedom. I would argue that freedom is a necessary goal to have, so they need to build up to that goal. When you're weighing consequences, do you value long term goals like freedom and liberty for an oppressed group, or temporary safety from punishment?

Further, I don't think Biden supports trans people, so I reject the assumption here that it's some huge moral sacrifice for biden. Similar to his position on abortion, I think he's okay with the laws supporting trans people, but I think he personally doesn't for religious and moral reasons. 

And lastly on this topic of consequences. Do you think any moral decision is justified on the basis of it's consequences? Would you personally do morally unjust and obviously reprehensible things to a sentient being if it meant that 1000 people survive some catastrophic event? (don't want to name any specifics because I don't even enjoy talking about it)

>Most gay and trans folks aren’t Marxist-Leninists, believe it or not.  The vast majority of them are pragmatic 

Show your work, you can't just make claims like this. How would you determine what ""pragmatic"" means in quantifiable terms poltically, and then prove it. You can't just say that. There's no pragmatic party, there's democrats, republicans, independents, and third party voters. 

I asked: 

>Show your work, please.

you replied:

>I’m only making an informed guess.

Please be serious, you cannot just take the best case scenerio look at a complex situation and insinuate that it's the most likely situation based on zero data and a guess you're making.

>As for Gaza, actually, Jewish people do have ancestral ties to that land and were there before Arab people were

Yep, there it is. Oh my gosh, I'm a bit too exhausted to have this conversation. Gazans also have ancestral ties to the land, and both their ancestors were there before arabs. I wish you were aware of this already. Jews were predated in the levant by the canaanites, and even further away by natufians, not all of those groups became jewish, and some jewish people converted to other religions. The conflict is in zero way helped by who had ancestors in the land 2000 years ago. There was an expulsion of jews in what is now referred to as israel and occupied palestine just under 2000 years ago. There were Jews living in Israel much more recently in mandatory palestine, in a pluralistic country. Instead of living in a state with a native indigenous population, over 50% of the land of palestine that belonged to native indigenous people was handed to a group that largely didn't live there for 2000 years. This largely European invading occupation then stole more and more land. Now they have stolen about 85%, instead of just a bit over 50%. Do you think Russia should own over 85% of Ukraine? 

I will say, for someone who hates marxist-leninists so much, you sure do exemplify why leftist ideologies are more ethical."
0,"It's horribly ironic that a nation that makes so much noise on the theme of keeping children safe is actually responsible for such a lack of safety for children, and not just for trans kids in the US, but for so many children in so many parts of the world. This is a legacy of the lack of outrage following Madeline Albright's statement that the death of 500,000 Iraqi children as a consequence of US imposed medicine embargo was worth it.

I was horrified, back than, at the lack of public response to that, as I still am. It seemed then, and now, to be a result of the fact that both of the only two parties are equally invested in maintaining their prominence, so that the sins of either one end up being glossed over, because the only alternative, ever, is the opposition.

It simply cannot be true that in a nation of at least 350.000,000 people, all of their interests are served by two parties, and there is a history of both of those parties working to prevent the influence of any other.

Right now, the fact that this faux dualism is not enough to assure the rights of all citizens is made blatantly obvious by the lack of compassion on both sides for any of those whose lives do not fit the bland ideal American that suits the bland PR objectives of either party.

The fetishistic glorification of individuals at the front of political campaigns as saviors of the nation only ever lasts as long as it takes to get over the win or the loss of an election, and yet, due to the binary dualism of the system as it exists, resentments are never fully set aside for the sake of moving on and are instead invested in regressive argumentation on the merits of the one or the other at the expense of focusing on the fact that neither of the two parties are invested in anything other than the maintenance of their own institutional existence and the benefits they accrue.

How can anyone forgive the silence of the Democrats in the face of what is always being done to the minority communities in the country, simply on the basis that they are not the authors of the consistent Republican pogroms against minority communities, whether it's those who have no other choice than to live on welfare payments, whether it's immigrants or whether, as now. it's trans people? The bottom line is that both parties are failing everyone in the nation, both in current issues and by the machinations they employ to prevent the access of other parties or even independent candidates into the arena of political power. 

It is that greedy withholding of access that has led to the horror that now holds sway. People have stopped thinking for themselves and that is the most un-American of all possible consequences of the Great Experiment that I could ever have imagined. It is repugnant to me that any child should have to say that they live in fear of losing their lives simply because they exist, and it is all the more repugnant that this girl is neither the first nor the only ten year old child in America and around the world who has to live in fear of losing their lives for no other reason than the fact that they exist.

Forget the Republicans, forget the Democrats. The litany of both parties' betrayal of their promises is long, so long that neither one has any credibility left worth the mention. Do your own thinking and figure out ways that you can make your world better, and bring all of your energy to that task, because there is nothing to be gained by expecting the politicians of either party voluntarily donating any part of the largesse that they hoard and defend towards the welfare of any of the victims of the bipartisan dearth of compassion and empathy that has long since become their hallmark. The silence of the Democrats in the face of the fact that the Republican's Project 2025 is a real policy that is already being enacted is proof enough of their complicit abandonment of the people.

By the way, self defense by any means is always valid. Premeditated assault is not."
0,"People made it clear they were unhappy with Biden and unhappy with the economy.  Harris's campaign took the absolutely boneheaded move of trying to convince people that Biden was good and the economy was good.  The median voter votes on feelings, not facts.  As soon as she was asked what she would have done differently than Biden and she said she wouldn't have done anything different, that clip of her shooting herself in the foot was put in front of a megaphone to show people - on the left and the right - how Harris was making it clear that her plan was to be four more years of Biden.

Now, in terms of policies and data and statistics, you can make the arguments that Biden's policies were good or that inflation was going down or that the economy was healthy.  But based on Biden's unpopularity - again, on the left and on the right - people didn't *like* him and elections are ultimately a popularity contest.

Beyond that, the Trump campaign ran on clear messaging that ""Everything is bad and we'll fix it"" and defined clear enemies that they want to ""beat.""  The Harris campaign ran on messaging that ""Everything is fine actually and we'll make it marginally better but not too much better and we're going to compromise with Republicans as much as we can"" and just had a big tent that they picked up and moved somewhere else, expecting that formerly Democrat voters would follow them.

It's a popularity contest, and appealing to emotions wins elections, not facts or data.  You know how Trump voters wear Trump hats and put Trump flags on their trucks and outside their houses and Harris voters just didn't do that?  It's easy to look at tribalist behavior like that and be like ""yeah that's because they're a bunch of cultists"" but you know what cultists have in common that Democrats don't?  Cult leaders promise their cultists whatever the cultists want to hear and the cultists show up to drink the koolaid.  And in what is - and I cannot stress this enough - a *popularity contest*, riling people up gets them to the polls.  Promising more of the status quo isn't going to win you voters who want change, and in a year where incumbent candidates are losing elections all over the globe, Harris - despite NOT TECHNICALLY being the incumbent, and seeing a massive surge in voter enthusiasm after her selection despite the fact that she wasn't elected in a primary because there basically wasn't one - made a massively dumb decision to decide to paint herself as basically the same as the incumbent."
0,"Look, I’m very cynical. You’re right. Maybe I only see the bad. But it’s awfully hard to see any good in our system when you really dig into American politics. 

> They are people who grew up in America and have values beliefs that any other American has went into politics to act on those values and beliefs.

I completely agree, that’s why they get into politics. What other reason could there be? The problem is, American politics are extremely cutthroat. It’s hard to win on a highly controversial opinion, and right now the controversial opinion is us. Like I said in the first comment, the representatives and state congress of my state are among the only ones I like because even though we are being attacked and weaponized, they don’t waver in their support. I also said “the only ones I know of” because I don’t know anything about the representatives for every blue state. The fact that they are so well protected, means they probably care too. But the ones on Capitol Hill? Most of them seem to support us when it’s convenient. Just look at the support for the NDAA. 

Just because someone has LGBTQ family members they care about, doesn’t mean they will stand up for us even when it’s inconvenient. As you mentioned, Harris has a queer daughter, and I am sure she loves her and supports her very much. But why would she leave LGBTQ rights completely out of her campaign? Because it’s too unpopular of an opinion. LGBTQ rights are being weaponized, and the country is becoming more conservative. There are two ways democrats can go. They can stick firm to their values in order to protect marginalized groups, or they can keep moving toward the center to gain swing voters. Guess which one they are going to do.

Also, as I mentioned, LGBTQ rights are not the only issue I base this on. The fact is that a lot of them (including Biden and Harris) support Israel committing genocide on Palestine. Harris thinks Israel has a right to “defend itself” against Palestine, but has yet to say the same for Palestine, even though they are the victims of literal war crimes. That alone is enough for me to not like those particular democrats.

Saying they don’t care about us was a poor choice of words. What I mean is that they don’t care enough to stand up for us when it’s unpopular. During Biden’s campaign, they were all pretty vocal about their support for us, but as soon as Trump used us a a bogeyman, they not only support us less, but some have even blamed us for being the reason Harris lost. ([source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna179370)). 

They might be fighting it right now, but it’s pretty clear they won’t keep supporting us if it could cost them their job. That’s why I don’t really trust a lot of them."
0,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about trans healthcare. This question makes it seem as though there was NEVER ANY healthcare from the medical community prior to the most recent four years. Actually, there was trans healthcare even prior to Obama—the “gate” was primarily affordability. The difference was the difficulty in finding healthcare that was paid by private insurance. There had been no government mandates to assist making trans surgeries and hormones more affordable and accessible. Mostly, almost every private insurance plan (not all) considered gender affirming surgeries to be elective. The ones that helped pay for any surgeries were rather more selective in which surgeries they would pay for. 

Trans healthcare won’t simply disappear if/when Biden’s executive orders are reversed. But yes, there is cause for concern, especially for those of us planning surgeries since needed surgeries are so expensive, and if more insurance companies decide to exclude the coverage they have added, it will make affordability a major issue.

—-from AI:
The statements you mentioned are partially true, but they need clarification. Former President Trump did express his intention to end transgender healthcare for minors, but there hasn’t been a recent executive order specifically targeting trans healthcare.¹

Regarding the congressional bill, it’s true that some lawmakers have proposed legislation that could impact trans healthcare. However, the outcome is uncertain, and it’s not clear if the bill will pass or how quickly it could be enacted.

If a bill were to pass, the implementation timeline would depend on the specific language and provisions. It’s possible that changes could take effect on a specific date, like January 1, 2026, or they might be phased in over time.

Regarding your scheduled procedures, it’s essential to stay informed about any potential changes to trans healthcare policies. However, it’s also important to note that existing healthcare services and insurance coverage would likely continue until any new policies take effect.

To stay up-to-date on the latest developments, consider following reputable news sources and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations. You may also want to consult with your healthcare provider or insurance company to understand how any potential changes might impact your scheduled procedures.

This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”), diversity, equity, and inclusion — 5 — Foreword (“DEI”), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists. Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned.

0,"If you read the article (or headline?), the entire point is to convince people to contact their representatives to vote no on the bill. They might oppose the bill on paper, but they are also clearly signaling to reporters that if the issue is forced on them (eg, choosing between not passing the bill in time or passing a bill with the provisions) that they will vote for the provisions in order to pass the bill.

>And we should not assume that our voices have no impact, or that all hope is lost. Seth Moulton, one of the first anti-trans Democrats after the election, appears to have learned this lesson already. After a large pro-trans rights office outside his office last month, Rep. Moulton appeared to walk back most of his comments and voted “No” on the NDAA bill in the House this week. Similarly, H.R. 9495, which would have allowed Trump to shut down non-profit organizations with little accountability, lost significant support in the House from Democrats after constituents flooded their phones and emails with opposition.

81 Democrats in the House is more than 1/3 of House dems. It only takes 20% of Senate dems voting yes for this bill to pass, and we cant just wait around hoping that they get the message. Manchin and Sinema are basically guaranteed to vote for it, so there's only 7 votes to spare. People have to mobilize and contact them immediately.

Additionally, the threat is very real. I was surprised by the 81 Dems this week. I dont want to be surprised again.

0,"Marxist-Leninists and others on farther left overestimate the number of Democrats in Congress from Obama’s first term who were pro-choice.  We still had at least a couple socially  conservative Southern Democrats.  It’s unfortunately not something he likely would’ve had enough support in Congress to codify Roe.  He needed 60 votes in the Senate to pass Roe, and too many Democrats at that time were either. not pro-choice or were opposed to getting rid of the filibuster.  You can read more about that in the answers that are in this link. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1gizwwy/why_didnt_democrats_pass_legislation_codifying/

No, I’m not saying he’s a centrist, I’m saying he’s pragmatic and tactical. Things like gay marriage were very unpopular back then and dems would’ve likely lost to Republicans if they openly said they supported it at that time.  So he was probably socially progressive on that issue, but knew it might be a political liability to be public about that back then. And I wouldn’t say Biden has been a centrist, particularly not lately.  He’s governed in a more progressive way than pretty much every other president.  For instance, he got rid of Donald Trump’s outright ban on transgender people serving the military, and negotiated with Congress to get gay marriage to be recognized at a Federal level.  

I think Biden or Harris would be just fine.  I don’t like it that this defense bill has this bigoted requirement in it, but it’s obvious to me that Biden did this because he he knows that if he doesn’t sign it, it will be kicked back to the to Congress for further negotiation, which will not happen until the new Congress is in.  And that Congress is going to have more Republican control than the current one does.  Not only that, but it likely wouldn’t get signed until Trump is in office.  Having such a bigoted rule added to the bill is the fault of Republicans who decided they would not otherwise pass it.  I’d rather have this passed now under Biden than have it be pushed to when we have a more Republican-controlled Congress and presidency, which is what would happen if it didn’t get signed before Congress comes back next month.  Wouldn’t you prefer that?   "
0,"From this ACLU press release:

“A federal district court judge has [rejected a preliminary injunction](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-27-Dkt-55-Order-Denying-PI.pdf) request, allowing enforcement of a new Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) policy aimed at withholding gender-affirming medical care to those diagnosed with gender dysphoria and forcing transgender women into their male gender assigned at birth.

On September 30, 2024, the Florida Department of Corrections issued a [bulletin](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/12/004-4-Health-Services-Bulletin-15.05.23-1.pdf) setting new rules for the medical care that the department would provide to transgender people in its custody who had received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Contrary to the medical mainstream, the bulletin suggests those seeking hormone therapy may have endured “short-termed delusions or beliefs which may later be changed and reversed” and recommended against providing any gender-affirming medical care unless extensive barriers are overcome.

That same day, at Florida Department of Corrections facilities across the state, transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria were rounded up and informed that FDC policy had been changed, “up to and including hormone therapy.” They were specifically told that they would no longer have access to clothing and grooming standards that accord with their gender identity and would have 30 days to comply.

Transgender women were told that those who did not cut their hair in compliance with male grooming standards would be forcibly shorn, and those who did not turn in their female undergarments and feminine canteen items would be disciplined. Transgender women were forced to have their breasts examined to determine if their breasts were large enough, in the eyes of the department, to require a bra.

“Florida officials are waging a baseless campaign to dehumanize and degrade incarcerated people like our client,” said **Li Nowlin-Sohl, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s LGBTQ + HIV Project**. “Allowing this policy to move forward threatens the basic human rights of transgender people in the state’s custody and the court’s order today affords the state’s policy more credulity than it deserves when the clear intent of the state is to ban this health care outright.”

Fuck these Florida fascists and  this  Corrupt Trump appointed judge,  [Allen Winsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Winsor),  for allowing  cruel and unusual punishment on the state’s incarcerated trans people!"
0,"Oh, the banality of evil. (TW to trans peeps, don't read this right now if not in a good space, P2025 discussions)

Well, first, they want to classify being trans as pornography and make that a sex crime (so existing in public is criminal and if you're caught you're put in the wrong jail, see v-coding on Google for some horror of this process and TW for trans people). They introduced a federal bill to legally define sex at birth. This legislates us from being ourselves anywhere in public if it passes (without harassment and constant discrimination). They're passing a rule in healthcare to allow refusal to treat trans patients for any illness based on belief (they tried in 2020 but couldn't finish before the election). Without legal recognition, we can't change our gender and potentially name. This erases us, as well as our suicide stats since no one changing gender exists. If we can change the name but not gender, we have to out ourselves and be in danger in any ID situation.

They are partnered with SEGM, Genspect, Heritage, and ADF and have bogus studies ready to publish through NIH that discredit the entirety of gender affirming care, criminalizes our providers as abusers, and targets anyone that supports us to isolate us through DoJ and other agencies.

That porn thing? They're using it with KOSA to restrict any representation of 'trans ideology' anywhere (this sub will be targeted too). It will be classed as porn and scrubbed from everywhere mainstream if they can. Federal funding is withheld from any hospital or doctors providing care, so even if it's not illegal technically, no one can provide it even privately.

No teaching in schools of any age. This includes med schools for specialities in gender affirming care. Theres already barely any, this leaves us to pure ignorant bigotry in the system. History gone (we were among the first victims of the Nazis and they did this to and literally burned 100 years worth of advancement, history and knowledge). So, we can't be in public without arrest threats, and have no recourse because institutions will be directed to show prejudice, they want to demonize our care and act like we were abused (which usually means they'll want to 'fix' us) and publishing stuff online without being underground or darkweb will be nigh impossible. Scotus looks like they may shed our Equal Protection under the Constitution next month as well which makes it a field day for legislators. This is what they did in Russia effectively (but terrorists, from my understanding, not groomers and porn as they're branding here). This is non exhaustive but hopefully paints a picture of how genocide can be done by penstroke.

Not saying it's all gonna happen, but they've got full power and were shouting to cheers outside SCOTUS about 'permanently wiping transgender ideology (people) from the face of the Earth.' That guy has the House speaker's ear."
0,"Rolling stone lets you click past it or just use the read mode that most mobile browsers have. But here’s the top paragraphs:

>For the last few years, the GOP has coalesced around an idea that would short-circuit essentially all trans health care in America: banning federal funds from going to businesses that provide health care specific to changing one’s sex or gender identity, including hormones and surgeries. It would essentially signal to the private sector that if it wants federal dollars, it needs to stay away from sex- or gender-affirming care, and bow down to right-wing pundits who aim to, in their own words, “eradicate” and “erase” this form of health care. 

>Language in House Republicans’ most recent funding bill for the Health and Human Services Department would do just that — ban money from any federal program to entities that do “social transitioning” or drugs and surgery for “gender dysphoria.” Gender dysphoria is the specific diagnosis doctors use to justify those medical interventions. This legislation has not gotten a vote yet and would need to be reintroduced next Congress to be considered. But it has been a top priority for Republican lawmakers in the House, and Trump himself has promised he’d ask Congress “to permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these [trans] procedures.”

>Bans like these can lead to the private sector discontinuing behaviors altogether — and once they are in place, they are hard to get rid of: The Hyde Amendment, enacted in the 1970s, led to most abortions no longer being performed in hospitals, and is continually renewed each year. 

>Medical groups and civil rights advocates in D.C. tell Rolling Stone they believe that if a Hyde-level ban on federal funding were enacted, many hospitals will simply prioritize federal dollars over continuing this highly specialized form of medical care. So much medicine is performed through hospital systems and universities that this could mean ending access for many."

The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors. This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”), diversity, equity, and inclusion — 5 — Foreword (“DEI”), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists. Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.

Enforce the death penalty where appropriate and applicable. Capital punishment is a sensitive matter, as it should be, but the current crime wave makes deterrence vital at the federal, state, and local levels. However, providing this punishment without ever enforcing it provides justice neither for the victims’ families nor for the defendant. The next conservative Administration should therefore do everything possible to obtain finality for the 44 prisoners currently on federal death row. It should also pursue the death penalty for applicable crimes—particularly heinous crimes involving violence and sexual abuse of children—until Congress says otherwise through legislation."

# Dear Society: Fuck You.

When I was born, you declared me **a boy**.

When I was six years old, you knew I was different and so you bullied me relentlessly.

Whenever I expressed myself in a way you deemed non-conforming—such as crossing my legs, speaking the wrong way, or wearing the wrong thing—you called me a faggot or a pussy. It didn’t stop at verbal abuse; it escalated to physical violence. I would come home from school with large bumps protruding from my head after having my skull slammed into the concrete walls of the hallway.

No one was there to protect me; that much was clear. It was my fault after all. I was acting in a way that deserved punishment. I needed to adapt or I would not survive. So, I became a chameleon. I acted like the exact person you thought I should be.

Each decision I made was never about what I wanted. It was about making my peers happy, making my parents happy, making my teachers happy. It was about making *you* happy.

You laid out my whole life plan even before I was born. First, I would go to school where I would get the best grades. These grades would let me get into the best college. In college, I would get the best grades so that I could get a job at the best company. Then I would work for this company as hard as I could. I would do such a good job so that I could get promotions and raises so that I could make as much money as possible. With that financial stability I could attract a woman who would have kids with me. My kids would then have the same set of expectations placed on them as you placed on me and the process would complete anew.

I was such a good fucking kid. I listened and obeyed like no-one else. I got the best grades, went to the best school, made the most money. I did everything you told me to do.

I’m not sad. I’m not depressed. No, that is not a tear, I AM NOT CRYING. Those feelings are for the weak. I am the embodiment of success.

So, the years go by, and I get older and older. They seem to be going by so fast, each one blending with the last. Some of the people and places change, but the story remains the same. At some point it hits me that I am going to die one day. I am going to die without ever having lived. And I knew, much like when I was a little child, that no one was coming to save me. I was going to have to save myself.

# Confronting Reality

These last few decades, I lived my life for you. It has brought me so much suffering. As a child, I thought nothing could be worse than your lack of acceptance of me. I thought nothing could be worse than the verbal and physical abuse. And now, fully realizing the extent of the sacrifice I made, the sacrifice of myself and everything I am, I know that I would rather die than live for one more day under your terms.

You tell me that I’m mentally ill, that I have a mental health condition, that I’m crazy, that I’m denying reality. The entire foundation of my life thus far is built upon lies. It is built upon me pretending to be something for you. And you want to talk about denying reality?

You want me to pretend that I like wearing shorts more than wearing a skirt? You want me to pretend that I like wearing suits better than dresses? You want me to pretend that I like being dominant more than submissive? You want me to pretend that I’d rather penetrate my partner than be penetrated by them? You want me to pretend like I don’t want long flowing hair? You want me to pretend that I like having facial hair?

Why should I pretend this? Who is denying reality—me or you?

# Sex & Gender

I know I was born with a penis. I know that the cells in my body have XY chromosomes. I also know that I love to sing, and sew, and cook, and show emotion, and dress and act in a way that feels good to me.

You tell us that because we were born a certain sex, we automatically have 1000 predetermined personality traits. And yes, some of the time you are right. I was born a boy and I like legos more than barbie dolls. Good job, you got that one correct. But there are so many others that you got wrong. Because you don’t know me—only I know who I am. I am the one living in this body. I know my needs, desires, and wants more than you could ever hope to.

All of these traits which you associate with someone’s sex are called **gender**. It’s so important to distinguish between sex and gender. Sex is biological, but gender is something created by you, our society. Gender is a set of expectations that society puts on sex. These expectations shift and change over time, but they are always present.

Gender is like The Matrix — a completely fabricated world, but because it is all around us and we know nothing else, it appears to be immutable and real. But there is nothing real about saying “a boy can’t like pink” or “a boy can’t like to wear a skirt”.

Like Neo, I wish I could escape The Matrix and enter a world where gender didn’t exist, where I could simply like what I like without being categorized or classified. As of yet though, I am stuck here in the matrix.

# Categories & Boxes

Don’t get me wrong — categorizing is useful. It helps us predict how others might behave based on limited data, which is key to survival

If I tell you that someone supports the right of every person to own a firearm, you could predict, with pretty high accuracy, that this same person would also be in favor of lowering taxes. These categorizations exist because they are useful tools for our brains to predict things about people. Sometimes the categorization is wrong — for example, there are plenty of people who support the right to own a firearm who also are interested in raising taxes to support social programs. But as long as the categorization is right *most of the time*, it is useful to people.

Imagine I attend an NRA convention because I support the right to bear arms. Someone smiles at me, pats a ‘Proud Republican’ sticker on my shirt, and says, ‘Thanks for supporting our cause.’ Now, let’s say I agree with Republicans on this one issue, but for 999 others, I’m a Democrat.

With this “Proud Republican” sticker stamped on me, let’s analyze what happens when I interact with different people. A republican sees my sticker and invites me over to their house for dinner. At dinner, the conversation turns awkward very quickly. “What do you mean, you support abortion?!” “You’re not a real republican! Who gave you that sticker?!!!”. And any democrat who I come across will see my sticker and immediately turn away from me saying, “eww, a republican!”. Wearing this sticker effectively sabotages almost every interaction I have with other people.

Gender operates in much the same way as that sticker. I am walking around the world with a sticker that says “I’m a boy”. Even though, if you look individually at the 1000 characteristics that categorize people into “boy” vs “girl”, I would fall into the “girl” category for the vast majority of them. Because of the incongruence between my actual internal identity and the category in which I am placed, I am perfectly positioned to fail miserably with almost every interaction I have with people. The people who think they like me realize that I’m not the person they think I am. The people who look at me and immediately decide that they don’t like me miss out on what could have been a very rewarding connection.

These boxes and categories—created by YOU—are both artificial and powerful. This is why I can’t just ignore gender. This is why I can’t just be “a boy who wears a dress”. The category matters way more than any individual interest or trait.

The next time you see someone you ‘suspect’ is transgender because one trait doesn’t align with the others, just know that this person is not “pretending” to be a man or “pretending” to be a woman. This person was pretending their whole lives to be something else for you and they finally had the courage to be who they really are.

Do you really think I enjoy this or that it’s just for attention? I spent my entire life trying to hide. I minimized myself constantly in order to make other people more comfortable. I don’t want your attention, I just want to live my life as me. “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness”. That’s what I want, just to be left alone to live life in the way that makes me happy. Is it really so difficult?

# Difficult Topics

The conversation becomes more fraught when people perceive trans rights as infringing on the rights of other people. The biggest topics lately have been about access to gender-affirming care for adolescents, access to bathrooms, and access to sports.

People are being told that their kids are going to get “trans’d” at school, come home, and want to get their genitals cut off. Fear has taken over, leaving logic, reason, and compassion behind.

When considering these issues, reflect on my story and those of other trans people. Think about what would have helped us vs hurt us. Talk to trans people and listen to their perspectives—we’re rare, but we exist. You may have never met one of us before, but maybe you should before you make sweeping decisions that affect all of us.

For me, I wish I had been born in a time when people openly talked about gender in school. I wish I had figured this out much sooner. I wish I had access to puberty blockers and hormones as a kid. Undoing the effects of male puberty as an adult is an enormous challenge. It’s expensive, it’s painful, and the results are never as good as they could have been if I’d had access to care earlier.

# Waves Goodbye

Like being gay, being trans is just one possible part of the human experience—and it is not a choice. I would never have chosen this for myself. Yet every time I’ve tried to ignore it or deny it, it has felt like standing in the ocean, trying to fight the waves.

I hope the world becomes a more accepting place for us, even though it seems to grow more hostile each day. We make up just 1% of the population, yet we are demonized by mobs with pitchforks—people who bear an unsettling resemblance to the bullies of my youth. We are 4x more likely to be victims of violence, and 40% of us attempt suicide. Being trans is already hard, but the relentless pressure and hostility we endure often make life unbearable.

If you had been with me in the hallways of my school all those years ago, I hope you would have stood by me against the bullies. I hope you would have seen me as worth protecting—as human, and as worthy of living. I hope you can stand by me now.

You may have met me before, but you didn’t really know me—just a meticulously crafted mask that I created to protect myself. I am taking it off now.

My name is Violet, nice to meet you."
1,"I'm not aware of specific sources that would give a single narrative, but stuff might be out there. This below is a combination of stuff I have read, talked to others about, or experienced myself; I've been mainly on the US west coast and came out as trans in 2002.

Until pretty recently it was widely thought that ftm spectrum people were rare or even nonexistent. If you look at informational books about transness before the last twenty or so years, whether academic or for a mass audience, they'll generally either explicitly say trans men are a small minority compared to trans women, or will simply take for granted that they don't exist. And up until even more recently, rather than see reference to nonbinary people at all, you'll generally see references to crossdressers and perhaps ""transgenderists"" who are all assumed to be mtf spectrum; at most, drag may be mentioned and then you might see mention of drag kings. This is tied in with popular acceptable behavior and presentation by gender: even now, a woman who wears traditionally men's clothes is nowhere near as transgressive or controversial as a man who wears traditionally women's clothes. A woman who wears traditionally men's clothes is commonly thought of as doing work that women's clothes don't support well, or is alternative, or is a lesbian. A man who wears traditionally men's clothes is overwhelmingly thought of as doing it for sexual reasons -- and sexual in a way that ""she dresses like a man, she must be a lesbian"" isn't classically thought of as sexual. In particular, masculine lesbians are historically often imagined as asexual. (Transgenderist is an outdated term for people who pursued an ""incomplete"" medical transition like hormones without genital surgery, which at the time was considered explicitly sexual and against the practices of the few trans clinics in practice from a time that transness was considered vanishingly rare.)

A dive into both trans and feminist thought will hit on some of the background of that difference. Julia Serrano's *Whipping Girl* is a good if dated read there -- the original is quite dated and problematic despite the great content, so reading more recent editions is recommended if only to see Serrano's contextualization. Second wave lesbian feminist thought is instrumental here too for exploring the ways in which queer women's sexuality has often been simply ignored and treated as not truly sexual, where queer men's sexuality has been overwhelmingly criminalized in comparison.

This all influences people's options for how to do transness before trans communities were like they are now, before even transition was really available the way it is now. It also influences the shape of queer men's and queer women's communities, where trans people before trans communities might find space and start exploring. And it's far more common to find queer men's communities that exclude wearing women's clothes at all, than to find the reverse in queer women's communities. Conservative queer communities that simply mirror the transphobic status quo are likely to permit women wearing men's clothes and not men wearing women's clothes.

After WWII we get the invention and widespread distribution of the photocopier. This is huge, as it makes independent publishing possible, especially for small form stuff like magazines. And so alternative communities start using those to connect. The [Digital Transgender Archive](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/) and [University of Victoria Transgender Archive](https://www.uvic.ca/transgenderarchives/index.php) both have a wealth of these that can be worth digging through. A lot of magazines of the time, unsurprisingly, were smut or stuff widely perceived as smut: it's independent press, hey. Two other things are happening in the postwar period. During the war, men went to fight, women took on jobs commonly considered men's while at home. And so, during the war you had this expansion of social presentation options for women (the original [Rosie the Riveter](https://www.singulart.com/en/blog/2024/03/30/rosie-the-riveter-by-norman-rockwell/) as a great example) that never quite went away, though it did shrink back in the conservative wave after the war. So there's an increase in possibilities for proto ftm spectrum people. You also during that time had a bunch of men all bundled up together for years in a highly structured and hierarchical environment. Not all were gay, but yeah, this is the seads of modern leather, and when these men got back from the war they often formed communities in motorcycle gangs that more directly evolved into gay leather as we know it. And...that doesn't produce anything for mtf spectrum people; if anything, this is part of a wave of queer men's communities pushing proto mtf spectrum people out (again along with that conservative wave).

So, a lot of those early magazines building trans communities are smut directly, or are simply using the permission in that magazine space to talk about something that would be considered smut even when nonsexual. That was used for community-building among mtf crossdressers and early transgenderists and transsexuals, newly finding access to whatever medical transition was relevant to them. But they could usually find a skirt somehow and a place to hide it, and could privately connect over that. And that's the seeds of the modern trans-centric play party. There wasn't really a parallel thing happening for contemporary ftm spectrum people: where they were expressing their genders similarly, they were more readily able to engage in queer women's communities or simply hide in plain sight.

So, as ftm spectrum people became more visible, they tended to simply make space in queer women's communities. There's another long and messy history of this inclusion of ftm spectrum people that often came with simultaneous exclusion of mtf spectrum people; iirc Susan Stryker's *Transgender History* has a good section on that. Of course, plenty of ftm spectrum people were not queer women. I know Lou Sullivan is commonly referenced for talking about this experience in the 70s and 80s, but what he did was largely just move directly into the gay men's community; the gay leather community, with its highlighting of masculinity, has wound up on the leading edge of kinky ftm spectrum inclusion, despite its historical roots that pushed mtf spectrum folks into their own spaces.

You also have a growth of more generalized kink spaces and organizations over these decades, as different groups find that it isn't necessary to share every kink with others in order to form community (but maybe you're not going to read every magazine relevant to this larger community). Generalization was about building community between leather and BDSM and fetish and so on, but often it also was about bridging together straight and queer kinksters -- and trans ones too. So these spaces became important venues for trans people without meaningful transition options to connect, and those trans specific. It's not that all mtf spectrum people were going to those parties; many just went to the same events cis people were going to. The trans specific parties were primarily there to center gender play itself, which for many of them wasn't a kink -- instead, these parties were the only place they could express their genders. They held varying relevance for those who had transitioned and expressed their genders in everyday life; some continued going because they were well established in that particular community, some never had those specific community ties so it didn't matter, and some specifically wanted to go to other parties in order to focus on other kinks.

In the early-mid 90s, early-mid 00s, and early-mid 10s (yes, it kept happening), there were major waves of increasing trans visibility. The first wave is primarily marked by a shift of terminology from transsexual to transgender, as control over the narrative of transness shifted from the medical community to trans people ourselves; the second wave is primarily marked by the rising awareness of ftm spectrum people, leading to a sharp increase in people knowing transition was an option for them in the first place; and the third wave is primarily marked by a similar experience for nonbinary people, along with the widespread awareness that one could be nonbinary and trans at the same time, rather than nonbinary as a spot on a spectrum between trans and cis. A major impact of those waves was that many specifically gay kink spaces, which have largely centered masculinity, adopted or more actively enforced trans exclusionary policies targeting ftm spectrum folks. This has shifted heavily toward inclusion finally, but it took a long time. So, we focused on these generalized, ""pansexual"" kink spaces. The well-established trans-specific parties we found already attached to those spaces were...well, broadly not for us. Not just because ""trans-centered"" as noted above actually meant centering gender play, but also because the gender focus was well established thematically: ""pretty maid"" parties and such. Yes, ftm spectrum people can be as feminine as anyone else, I am and was, but the message of who and what the events were for was clear. Sometimes, ftm spectrum folks went anyway, and often the existing attendees were happy to share their space with new friends. And sometimes that lead to those parties shifting focus and purpose. Sometimes the gender play focus was maintained as a core part, but broadened to include all genders; and sometimes, the trans inclusion itself was centered, with gender play still welcomed but decentered.

Long brain dump. For going to kink parties, depending on your area, often the generalized parties are pretty trans welcoming. Trans specific parties vary so widely in purpose and community engagement that it's hard to generalize beyond saying, take a look and see if it's for you."
1,"Okay, so... You have a choice that you need to make. I won't pretend to know which one is the best one, because I don't know you or your family. But it appears to me that you have a handful of options here.

1) If this name you've chosen--the one your mother has now decided to give to your would-be sister--is really important to you, and you genuinely don't want any other name, and that's your decision, then the only thing that you even *can* do is to come out and make your feelings known. Stake a claim to the name that, frankly, you have a birthright to. She wanted this name for her firstborn daughter. You *are* her firstborn daughter. Make it known and understood that you feel betrayed and distraught at the thought of that name being taken away from you like some kind of dark fae scenario. If you want to claim this right, you *have* to actually *stake* your claim. And you can't do that without making it known. The chips will fall where they will. That is largely outside of your control. If she cares about you, and if she cares about your feelings, then she at least won't dismiss this out-of-hand. There may be conflict. There often is. But you cross that admittedly very frightening and intimidating bridge when you come to it.

2) Find a different name. Your own name. By you, for you. If you're not okay with this, see option 1. You can always try on different names in your daily life with your friends. A lotta girls need to do this for a long time before they find a name in their fit. Some go through, like, a dozen names or more, and it can go on for years sometimes. It *is okay* to try on different names no different than trying on different clothes.

3) Just own it and use the name anyway, and then be like, ""It's not MY fault you gave my name to my sister. You did that, not me."" If you go this route, though, it may still help to come out now so that she can't call bullshit on you about this name later and accuse you of trying to steal your sister's identity (idk what your mom is like... mine's kinda batshit like that, so that may be my trauma talking).

The way I see it, these are your only options. But I would also like to offer my own personal experience in this arena, since my story is kind of relevant here. 

When I chose my name, I explicitly put my family into consideration. I wanted to make the transition easier for them, and I partially made my name decision with that in mind. Before I was born, the doctors were convinced I was a girl (I mean, they turned out to be right in the end, but put a pin in that). 

I knew that my father was dead set on naming me Saturn. I also knew that my mother hated that, but had never really proposed any alternative. So, wanting to pay homage to the cis girl who should've been, but also not wanting to put my mother in that uncomfortable position of having to call me what my dad wanted, I took Saturn as my *middle* name. Even though she doesn't have to call me that, she still hates that I did that anyway. It did not help alleviate any discomfort for her, and she does not appreciate the consideration I afforded her.

Another factor behind that decision was that ""Saturn"", aside from the T in the middle, the N at the end, and being two syllables, was otherwise COMPLETELY different from the name I'd been living with in practice for 30+ years (although, now that I'm actually writing that down... that's actually a lot more similarity than I think I realized). So I was concerned that I might have difficulty processing that name as ""me"" upon hearing it, and I was also worried that my family might have difficulty using it because it's just so different and ""wouldn't taste right"" on the tongue, if that makes sense. And I didn't want this to be harder for them than it needed to be.

So I chose the name Clara, which superficially resembles the name I've always lived with. To make it easier for everyone. So that it wouldn't feel too alien to my family. It also helped that it's a name I genuinely love. This has backfired spectacularly. 

My mother absolutely *despises* it. Two visits ago, she said to me, ""Why couldn't you have chosen *literally any other* name?! I *never* would've given you that shit name."" She also said to me that the very reason I thought this would be easier--it being superficially similar to my deadname--apparently makes it ""so much harder"". Putting them into consideration did *literally nothing* to help make the transition easier. And, if my mother is to be taken at her word, actually made it *worse!* My brother I had to go full no-contact with. That's a whole other story. 

The point I'm trying to drive at here is that... at least speaking from my personal experience, you can bend over backwards to try to make your chosen name easier for your family, but it's absolutely no guarantee at all that it will help jack diddly. And it may even generate resentment and animosity anyway. At the end of the day, it's not their transition. It's not about them. It's your transition. It's about you and your identity. 

If you're *only* choosing this name by default, or because you're trying to be diplomatic... that *might* not necessarily be the best reason. ""Only"" being the operative word in that sentence. Those *were* reasons for me, but they weren't the only ones. It so happens that I do very strongly resonate with the name Clara, and I feel absolutely confident that this is the right name for me. If those are your *only* reasons, though, then it *might* be a sign that you don't even necessarily fully know your own identity yet if you don't know what your true name is. 

However, that said, I absolutely feel like claiming the name you would've had if you'd been born AFAB, like you should've been, out of a sense of ""I'm trying to correct the mistake of the circumstances of my birth, and set things right as they should've always been"", is a perfectly valid reason. However, if that is, indeed, the stance you want to take, then you need to own it, you need to have conviction, and you need to follow through on it. Fully. And that means taking action, confronting your mother, and making your true self known.

In the end, only you can say for sure what the right course of action is for you. And I want to make it clear that I'm not telling you to come out or saying that you should. I'm saying ""if A, then, as I see it, B"" but it's up to you if A.

PS: For what it's worth, this sister could still come out AMAB. Happened to me. AND my brother."
1,"My best friend came out as trans I just want to be very clear about this before you read this shitstorm of a post. I've never used reddit and that i am very bad at the ""LGBTQ- lingo""... Sorry in advance.

My best friend came out as trans...

Ok, i just really need to write this out because i've just been hit with a bombshell and my teeny tiny straight brain can't comprehend the news that i just heard. Feel free to comment and give advice. I just need to write my feelings on this topic. (There are going to be spelling mistakes, English is my second language.) FYI Before you read. I'm fully aware that i am a stupid uncultured and ignorant asshole... But i really want to help my friend...

My friend who i've known now since i was 16 (now 24) just recently had a lot to drink when we played video games this last night. In his drunken stupor he talked a lot of his mental health and how he struggles alot with it to me and his other friend on a voice call (Depression and self harm were the big topics)

We play and hang out as much as we can when we're not working opposing shifts. As you do. We are best friends after all!

About a year ago we were sitting on his couch having some beers and got totally shitfaced, laughing and telling jokes...but as it so often happens he started to tell me about his feelings, he starts opening up to me about his insecurites and such. I, as the good friend that i try to be listens to him of course. And he tells me he is Bisexual.

He tells me that he doesn't see gender as a defining factor of why he likes someone as a romantic partner. He was troubled by having to be drunk to tell me this but i reasured him that i was fine with it. ""Whatever floats your boat"" i said.

But i feel like an asshole... Because i became uncomfortable with these news. I didn't know what to think. Of course i knew that he wasn't hitting on ME and was going to confess his love or something. I know that much. But it kind of... Rubbed of on me in a uncomfortable way. I don't know how to describe it.

 A couple days pass and we don't really talk about it. Things move on, i unintentually or intentually, forget about it.

Fast forward to this past night. We were having a great time playing some video games and my friend starts drinking a bit more than just a few beers... ""Hell yeah bro, get wasted, its a saturday night who cares""... or something like that i said...

He starts making jokes about wearing thigh highs and a skirt, which in hind sight he has made before... I've just not thought about it. I laugh it off and we continue playing.

Later when we've finished playing we just start talking on the call with no game to play in the meantime and his other friend joins. We laugh and talk about work and make jokes as good friends do. But the tone suddenly changes after some time. The jokes my friend makes are getting a bit too self depricating. We try to figure out how he is doing and he goes on a tangent that has me stunned. 

He has been doing the forbidden self harm on his arms and legs and we try to get him to open up about why he has been doing it. Me being a stupid idiot gets mad and tells him of, trying to make him ""get a grip"" and speak up. I suggest talking to a therapist and such.
He then realizes that he maybe has said to much being drunk but luckily doesn't shut down the conversation as he has done before...

We talk some more about why he has been feeling sad and it comes down to a bombshell that hit me so hard in the face that i just sat there... stunned... Didn't really know how to feel.

My best friend for about 10 years tells me that he is living in the wrong body, being uncomfortable with how he looks and feels being a guy. is sitting on a voice call in a girl outfit and tells me he is wanting to become transgender, Male to female.

Me being a straight guy that has never had any gay experiences or have had any real knowledge of the LGBTQ+ community is feeling... Vexed, confused. These things only happen on TV or in the big cities i thought.

I am completly the WRONG guy i thought to be on my best friends side and telling him that i fully support him. But then again, who else is going to? 

I talk with him and his friend about this topic and i tell them that i don't understand, and that i probably never will. But i will support him, always. As this conversation dragged on for a long while it ended a bit abrupt. We said our goodbyes as i needed to go to bed.

Alas i am laying here on my bed writing this shitty post. I realize that all this time my friend has been totally shitfaced and is probably not going to remember alot of what we have been talking about. He is most definetly going to wake up tomorrow feeling hung over and regreting all that he has said. 

All i know is that i want him to feel better, he got stupidly happy when i said that i support him and that i will be by his side.

He said that he has been scared about coming out with this information to me as i am not a person who has been vocal about LGBTQ rights.

I know i am just word vomiting but this was something i think i needed to write down. 

What i am going to do is try to make my friend talk to a professional, like a therapist., I do think it is a VERY hard thing to do for him. Probably the most hard thing that he is ever going to do. But i think that will help him alot. There are of course other things in his life that he needs to talk about. Not just about the trans thing. 

I might be a dumbass who doesn't know anything about this topic but i just want my friend to not be sad anymore and not become another victim beacuse nobody would listen to him.

Again, if you are reading this i am so sorry if my incompitance has made your eyes burn. This is one of the first times i ""vent"" online and write a post for that matter since i can't really talk to anyone about this. Hope you have a wonderful day!

1,"Im just so happy you questioned what you were being told and made it out of that echo chamber. Any community that centers hatred of another group should raise red flags I think. 

Beyond what others have said I wanted to ask if you have access to therapy. First and foremost, it sounds like you’ve experienced some very intense stuff already at a young age. I hope you’re getting support as you process everything. 

Beyond that, therapy is also a great place to explore why certain things (eg infantilization, gender roles, etc) create strong emotional reactions. It’s actually recommended that a lot of therapists do therapy themselves so they can have a place to work through any judgment or reactions they’re having towards their own clients, since it’s well understood that these kinds of feelings often have more to do with us than the other person. 

Lastly, I can say on a personal level, that while in day to day life I dislike a lot of the infantilization stuff and don’t really relate to it, I do have moments where I’ve allowed myself to play with it a little. There’s a few things going on I think, and all really have to do with the oppression we face in a sense. I’ll explain below in case it helps. 

Primarily, for me, it’s just a way of caring for my inner child, especially since i spent so much of my life hiding all those deeper emotional parts. An example would be how I recently found a kids book for little girls at the thrift store and got it for myself because for whatever reason it touched something in my hard and made me tear up a bit. I have a pink blanket with unicorns and some stuffed animals too. It’s just a very personal thing though about giving myself love and acceptance in a way I always struggled so much with. Frankly, I have cis friends who also have things like this, I probably just have a tiny bit more. 

Second, there’s often a stage early in transition where we are figuring out who we are. This can mean trying all sorts of different styles, including ones too young for us. Like many young women do during puberty, I had moments where I tried to be a little extra “girly” because I wanted so badly to fit in and then as I continued to grow and figure out what being a woman meant to me I moved away from that. It can look odd probably because we are sometimes doing it at a later age, but the fact is we never had a chance to do this kind of identity exploration when young in most cases. So when you see it, try to realize it’s often transitory. And again, I’d ignore a lot of what’s in the internet lol. 

Finally, I’ll admit very frankly that in some cases - and especially before my transition - my gender identity would show up in sexual ways. I kept this to myself, but I do think it’s important to acknowledge. As one of my therapists said, our sexuality is often a place where repressed parts of ourselves can show up safely as fantasy. I think a lot of the more sexual stuff you see can likely be explained in this way - the more people repress or feel shame around their gender or even the specifically younger expressions of their gender, the more it may show up in this way. Plenty of cis people also have “strange” sexual fantasies so it’s in no way unique to us. My point is just to realize that when you see people online expressing their sexuality in off putting ways, sometimes its maybe an escape valve for repressed feelings they have no other outlet for. 

It can also be a way to confront gender dysphoria, by trying to feel “sexy” in your own body. I don’t know people post stuff on the internet, but I guess plenty of cis people do too. I have cis friends who take sexy photos of themselves for similar reasons, though they aren’t posting it. Personally, I get pretty uncomfortable with a lot of sexual stuff and so it bothers me sometimes when people are louder about this stuff and put it online but I know that’s more about me than them. 

At the end of the day, every person is unique and I do believe in personal responsibility so I’m not trying to justify anything extreme. Have you heard of the fundamental attribution error in psychology, though? Perhaps that’s what I’m getting at. When we do odd or bad things, we often justify it in ourselves based on context. When others do those things, it’s very easy for us to decide it’s they are a “bad” or “odd” person. We attribute it to who they are vs just being a potentially momentary or transitory behavior in reaction to some context (here, societal oppression and all the intense feelings of navigating puberty without the usual landmarks and support, plus the intense feelings of gender dysphoria). So I offer the above as a personal example of some of that context. 

I also think this perspective is important beyond just trans people. For what it’s worth, I don’t hate TERFs or think they are bad people for what they say and do. I think what they say and do is bad. I am also sad for them. I imagine many have experienced trauma or for some other reason must be quite sad to act with so much fear and hatred, and my heart breaks for them. I used to work with a woman who I later found out was a very active TERF. She was a lovely coworker and mentor (this was all before my transition). People can be complex and I often wonder what happened to her and if she’s doing okay. Reading your post, I hope she too can find her way to empathy one day though I do worry she was a little too far gone."
1,"It sounds like maybe you've realized that you're trans but you haven't unpacked all of the implications yet. Congratulations on coming out and I hope you find the journey to a more personal understanding is relatively frictionless. People are probably going to be pretty hostile and downvote you, because arguing with this take which, frankly, comes off as really transphobic and ignorant is an endless, thankless task- as soon as one person is addressed another pops up offering the same thing, and eventually it gets easier to just shout them down.

But I'm in a mood to write today so I'm going to try.

> Why do we get to force our beliefs in them, but they can't force their beliefs in us? How about both sides stop forcing anything, instead just accept everyone.

It *really* sounds like you haven't actually accepted that being trans is normal yet. Let's start by saying that I agree with you, if being trans is *actually* an abnormal ""Opinion,"" then the things you're saying make sense- nobody else is obligated to ""Believe"" it, we should live and let live. And guess what, we do! I don't give a *damn* what some fool thinks about me. I am a woman and I live as a woman and if someone says ""You're a *man*"" I go ""OK :)"" and carry on with my day. 

However- those aren't actually the things that are happening. It's not ""You won't let us say you're a man in peace :("" that is the problem. This isn't a calm, reasonable discussion about a ""Belief."" In my home state last year there were something like 30+ bills trying to make it illegal for me to exist. Illegal to ""Cross-dress"" in public, illegal to use a women's bathroom, illegal for therapists or psychologists to even *talk about being trans* to anyone under 25. They are doing their best to ban medical care for us, too- not just kids, but adults as well. You just came out- imagine that you are doing so in a world where it's literally a crime to be you. That is the actual fight we're having, not whether it's legal for some person to disagree with you. All those laws are founded on the the idea that the guy saying ""You're a man"" is *objectively right* and *his beliefs should be protected by law*. **That** is why this is so militant and the fight is so difficult. Again, I don't give a damn what some guy thinks. What I care about is that he (and 77 million more like him) are trying to *make me live in a way that makes him comfortable, or die.* And if you come out and start living as your trans self, they're going to do the same to you.


Let's address some specific points:

Schools- I am not sure what you have heard or believe here. There is an enormous amount of fear mongering. Maybe you should speak to some teachers- they are going to tell you that no school is teaching gender stuff to kids. They would be absolutely *pilloried* if they did. What is being criminalized right now is not ""Teaching kids about gender"" it's *protecting trans kids*. Respecting a trans child's identity and not outing them to their parents- if you look at the laws that are being passed, that is what is being made illegal. Nobody's going into classrooms and telling Billy he's a girl. But the good ones are trying to protect Susie when she *says* she's a girl, and the right-wing says they should go to jail for that. If you understand in your heart that you didn't *choose* to be trans, do you think those kids did? That they're being taught to be this way? Imagine you had hateful, unaccepting parents- but you decided your teacher was safe. If you'd told your teacher you were trans, would you want them to respect you? Or would you want them to say ""Legally I have to call you by your deadname and also inform your parents immediately that we had this conversation."" The fight here is not to protect parents' rights to raise their kids how they want- it is to give children a last-resort space to be themselves so they don't spend have to spend their whole childhoods in the closet, *which is why trans kids commit suicide at ridiculous rates.* Look up the statistics- this is a fight to save kid's lives.

Sports- Again I am not sure what you have heard or believe. And again, maybe look around at the actual competitions- there are like, 1 or 2 trans athletes in any given *state* and *none* of them are winning often. It turns out that medical transition from testosterone to estrogen (which is already required) actually completely changes the physical performance of the body- that trans women really are just, physically, women. It *also* turns out that there is a long long history in women's sports going back to 100 years ago of accusing women of color and ""Masculine"" cis women of not being ""Feminine"" enough, and actively testing their testosterone levels and policing them, and if you look at the women who are being persecuted for this trans sports stuff- in the last year two different cis women of color are the most prominent ones who have been attacked. This is purely a culture-war distraction that is being used to alienate trans people from cis folks and drive a wedge in. I don't *care* about sports. But nobody pushing this issue cares about women's sports either, and if you look at *any* of them you'll notice that they don't spend a single second thinking or talking about women's sports except for this one issue. What they actually care about is finding an easy way to enforce their belief that ""Trans people are not what they say they are."" Once everyone agrees on sports, they move on to bathrooms. Then schools, then legal paperwork, then medical care.

>Why do we get to force our beliefs in them, but they can't force their beliefs in us? How about both sides stop forcing anything, instead just accept everyone.

Returning to this. I have never forced my beliefs on anyone. I haven't seen a single law passed saying ""Trans women are women, trans men are men."" Have you? Have you seen a single consequence for anyone getting up on a national stage and saying trans women are men? I just watched a man get elected president after running 200 million dollars in ads about how we shouldn't be allowed to have medical care in prison. I am *happy* to leave the bigots alone. But I'm going to keep speaking up to defend myself, and you're going to have to learn pretty quickly to do the same. Because it's not really about living in peace- it's about living at all, and there are a lot of folks who do not think we should be allowed to."
1,"I just found out that I'm biological girl!!!! Well hi my name is Corey I'm 23 amab I had a pretty normal childhood I think....I was the fraternal twin to my brother. I never really compared myself with him as we got along really well. But my life started to change around the time of puberty. My brother developed normally but I was a late Bloomer. I was always confused about my own identity since I had the sex ed talk in fifth grade. I noticed that I didn't have the changes that many of my peers had. This was around the time I heard what transgender was. Their was this girl with the same name as me fighting for bathroom Rights in school. That was the moment I really became fascinated with the whole experience. I watched every YouTube video, timelines , make up, boy to girl etc.


 As I began to crack my egg so to speak I started to keep my hair long and paint my nails with nail polish I bought at dollar tree.. I always had a stash of girly things hidden in my room scared of being found out. I thought I was just a sick pervert.

 But as the years passed my family just thought I was gay. I was always flamboyant since I was younger so they were sort of excepting. As I gotten my first job at a major retail store during my last year in highschool 2019.  I began to buy more and more feminine clothes then I dyed my hair burgundy red. Mixing that with having to wear a mask most people didn't think I was a man ironically getting mis gendered in embarrassing ways. Customer's would say that a woman helped them then my coworker's would correct them as I came back to help. This really made me feel wonderful hearing she and her then swiftly getting stabbed in my heart at my coworker's words. 

That was when I started hrt. Then I got scared of how fast the changes happened so I stopped treatment.  Trying to make myself be as masculine as my brother. I began to get into sports and helping him with his car. But I felt like I was going against my nature. So these last few months I have begun to secretly transition again... Mostly due to me getting my first apartment finally away from my family. 

So I have been really happy with how it's going. But then I got my first tattoo recently and it wouldn't heal so I went to the dermatologist and found out that I have psoriasis and they prescribed me humira a biologic to help with my skin... But I had to get a full panel of blood work. Before I could get my prescription. Then I went back to my dermatologist for my follow up appointment and for them to show me how to use the injection properly.

 That's when they ask me for my preferred pronouns probably because I was dressed pretty fem and I let them know about my hrt. That's when my dermatologist asked me why I was on it. I said that I was transitioning she then asked me if it was a typo because it said estradiol then she said that was strange for a biological Female... I then stated that I was born male at birth she looked at me confused then as we discussed different things she then came to the conclusion for me to get a chromosome test done and Lord behold I am intersex female and my parents knew about it and never told me... Here I am thinking I'm going through this wholesome process of self discovery then bam the answer to the feelings about my own identity and why I always felt off.

 I really can't tell you how much this revelation has changed how I feel about myself.. I am for all intensive purposes. Female not just something in my mind but my entire being. Now I have even greater issues because I don't know if I can identify as trans but I am transitioning.... I really don't know what I should do moving forward?

(*every one's experience is valid I was not referring to it just being in anyone's mind just how I felt)

Update: so I just had an appointment today with a specialist. I was formally diagnosed as a pseudo female hermaphrodite. Ps I don't like that terminology

Also was diagnosed with CAH : congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  Which is why I had some minor male puberty development...

I also want to say thank you All for your support and suggestions.  I was and still processing all this new information about my body and am in the process of figuring out my next steps...

I will start identifying as both trans and intersex.. mostly because it's easier to just tell them I'm trans than having to explain something I'm still confused about myself. I already have had issues discussing this stuff with my family. Ps I'm not talking to my parents until we can all go to therapy."
1,"No one is saying you have to date trans women when you don’t want to. Did you read what I said? Because I said exactly that, and then you went straight back to “you’re predatory if you tell me I should date trans women when I don’t want to”. 

I said in THIS situation in the OP, where a straight man walked up to a woman he thought was beautiful and wanted her to kiss him, so she does, then they hit it off and get to talking, and she tells him she’s trans, he has no right to be disgusted with her. If he is disgusted by her, then he is transphobic. “I’m not disgusted by *you* I’m just disgusted that I kissed you”. Do you honestly think anyone is going to buy that? 

And I didn’t say “if a straight man denies a gay man’s advances then he’s homophobic”. I said you view her, the trans woman, who looks and sounds like a beautiful woman to you, as a man solely because she’s trans. That’s the definition of being transphobic. And the fact that you’re now so deeply uncomfortable and “disgusted” means you not only view her as a man, but you also can’t stop thinking that you just kissed “a guy with a dick”. If you’re that bothered by that when you were literally the initiator the whole time and you didn’t even know this woman, then yes you’re homophobic too. I would have no problem with finding out the person was trans, personally. I might not date them, but I’d still enjoy the fact that I just kissed someone I thought was beautiful and I had a great time with them, trans or not. 

Again, this is akin to finding out they’re not actually white and then being disgusted with them for “lying by omission”. They’re literally just existing—they look like this to everyone. They’re not “pretending to be white” or “trying to look white” to deceive you. That’s how they look. And you thought they were beautiful so you wanted to kiss them. This guy did the same exact thing with the trans woman. She isn’t “lying by omission” just by virtue of being trans, which is what you’re arguing. I’d ask the same questions here that I’d ask about the non-white lady example: how is she supposed to know you’re racist and you are “disgusted” by the thought of kissing non-white women? Why is she expected to cater to you in that way, and stop everyone before they kiss her to say, “hey, before you kiss me, I just wanted to let you know that I’m not white even though I look white, in case that bothers you”?? You shouldn’t apologize for just *existing* and looking how you always look. You shouldn’t cater to some racist who is disgusted by the thought of two people of different races kissing each other. Just like how trans women shouldn’t cater to some transphobe who is disgusted by the thought of kissing a trans person. He went up to HER and wanted to kiss her, she obliged. She did nothing wrong. Before they got to know each other more and went back to his place, she told him she was trans because at that point you should let someone know. She did everything right. Saying she’s “lying by omission” about being a biological woman just by virtue of being trans, is transphobic. Whether you think it is or not, that’s the definition of being transphobic. 

A racist white person might say “no I’m not racist, I’m just disgusted by them”. It doesn’t matter if *he thinks* he’s racist or not, because there’s a definition of racism and he fits it perfectly. The same goes for transphobia. Your feelings about whether you’re transphobic or not don’t matter, because there’s a dictionary definition for a reason."
1,"I don't know how much this will matter to you. But, I'm also 27 and still in school, trying my best to figure out my life in the chaotic modern day. And I had a similar experience earlier this year. 

Something I learned with relationships, specifically regarding my mom, is that you can only do what you CAN do to help the people you care about understand you. But they have to be willing to learn and accept your life, your view, your difference. Even if they don't 100% agree with it.

YOU can't make them be the compassionate person that you might have dreamed they would one day become. It's on them to become that person. Because, in all reality, they should do it anyway because they want to be that person.

I desperately wanted my mom to understand my struggle with my body and my gender. But she could never get out of her own fucked-up viewpoint to hear what I was saying. The big point I'm gonna bring up is me having kids someday.

I have never wanted kids, not once in my life have I ever wanted to be a parent. And everyone in my family has known that, it's not something I keep secret. However, my mom decided to use it as ammunition to protest my transition. ""You'll never be a father if you keep fucking with your genetics!"" yeah, that's kind of the idea bitch!

Her selfish ass started going for sympathy afterwards. Complaining to me and other family about how she was losing her ""son"" and that I'm so selfish for not wanting to continue the family legacy (Which is so funny to me cause her family legacy is just addiction and manipulation. That's one hell of a legacy to be rallying for.)

It came to a head in September, On my birthday, when her and I got into a physical exchange because I was wearing a dress at my own birthday. ""YOU SELFISH BRAT, \*Deadname\* do you understand how much this hurts me to see you like this"" was the inciting statement. Legitimately, the moment those words hit my ears it was like a switch flipped in my brain. I let loose two decades of pent-up frustration targeted at her. After that night I blocked her on everything. told my family I won't talk to her again until she learns how to actually love her child unconditionally.

Like you, I started to question if I had done the wrong thing. Should I have just dealt with it like I usually did? Should I have been more considerate with the things I said? Should I have just walked away? I don't know and I don't care. I realized that I've been putting in ALL the effort, for years, to try to help her understand me. Never once has she ever shown any desire to get to know who I AM, instead she continues to live in this delusion of who she WANTS me to be. And every time I didn't fit into that mold (which happened a lot when I was growing up) It was my fault and I was ruining her perfect family.

I've realized that life is too short and too obnoxious already to be wasting your time on people who won't even take a couple minutes to learn what size clothes you wear so they stop buying you pants that are too tight. There are people out there who WILL love you no matter what. No conditions, No requests, No asterisks attached to the end of the ""I love you\*"" I know who those people are in my life currently and I'm much better off dedicating the time and energy I used to waste on her to them and continuing to find more people like them who will accept me as I am.

I don't know everything about your situation. But I do think life as a trans person is hard enough as it is in the modern day. We don't need to make it harder for ourselves by trying to justify our lives to people who barely even see past our surface level appearance.

I recognize this was a lot, It's 3:30am as I'm finishing this up so I don't know how much my message got through but I think you did the right thing. You fought for yourself, You were your own hero, and I hope you can move forward with your life with a little less weight on your shoulders not having to deal with that kind of ""Love""."
1,"So because I don’t trust cis men due to many of them behaving like the guy in OP I must not see myself as a man? What? Not trusting the average  cis men doesn’t make me not a man considering, statistically, cis men are the least trans positive or gender affirming group in society across multiple studies. I’m a man. I don’t need cis male friendship or validation to prove that 

Cis male allies and friends, the few that I have are the ones that have opened up to me about how cis men actually feel about trans guys. I’ve had conversations with cis men of a variety of sexual orientations and because I’m not desperate for their validation nor begging for their friendship they can be honest with me. They admit that many cis men don’t see trans men as male and many will claim some form of queerness in order to get access to the sexual parts they desire. I’ve had cis men admit to me they viewed their trans male partners as closer to women than not and felt guilty about it or didn’t see their relationship as gay. They’d never tell their partner that though because they’d lose sexual and emotional labor access. 

I’ve seen trans guys on r/gaytransguys silence other trans men who have had bad experiences with cis men or are more or less than positive about cis males as a collective. Typically guys with experiences like OP get victim blamed or shamed for just not picking “one of the good “ cis guys bye nobody talks about how cis men view trans men and how that causes toxic interactions. Enough trans guys all over social media have talked about cis male chasing and fetishizing us especially those that don’t pass that it’s almost a meme in our communities. Not all these trans guys had low self esteem many were manipulated into thinking a cis man was respectful and affirming until he wasn’t 

Please don’t make assumptions about what friends or allies I have. I have cis male friends I vet  them but if one of them turned out to not see me as a man or had some type of detrans/misgendering fantasy towards me or some other trans man…I wouldn’t be surprised.  I like my cis male friends but I don’t trust them to be anything other than the cis men they are which means I believe they will put their interests and attractions as cis men above my manhood as a trans  man. Ive come to expect that and I work with cis men within the context that they behave and within the culture they ascribe too. If my caution about cis men makes some not want to hang out with me then that’s fine. 

Also I’m a different kind of man to a cis man but that doesn’t make me not a man. I’m proudly a trans guy and would not wish to be a cis man so bad that o whitewash the bigotry and attitudes many cis man have towards trans men. 

Sorry but your method of going in blind and expecting a unicorn is why so many trans men end up in relationships with toxic cis men that then other gay trans guys blame them for. Please don’t assume the levels of self respect I have either. Just because I don’t assume all cis men are magically the one of the few good ones doesn’t mean I don’t have self respect. Just because I’ve been abused by cis men doesn’t mean my lack of self respect is to blame sometimes cis men abuse trans men because they’re transphobic. Sometimes cis men are bad people with prejudices that they accept due to their culture and seek to enact and abuse people with their cis male privilege. Sometimes a trans guy isn’t at fault for cis males abusing him."
1,"He wasn't ""deceived"" though. She just existed there, sitting on the booth, and he approached HER. HE initiated the kissing and everything, without even really getting to know her first. That's entirely on him. 

She probably assumed that either 1) He was cool with trans people and that's why he approached her, a random woman, not knowing her gender at all, and was still totally fine kissing her at a bar. Or 2) That he actually recognized she was trans and didn't care and that's why he approached her. She has no way of reading his mind and knowing ""Oh, he doesn't view me as trans at all and he is completely mistaken in taking me for a cis woman, also he probably is disgusted by the thought of kissing a trans woman, so I should out myself to him before he kisses me to spare his feelings."" How on earth is she supposed to know that the thought of kissing a trans woman will absolutely disgust him, when he's literally approaching her, a trans woman, then kissing her, and enjoying it the whole time?? His actions do not spell ""disgusted with kissing a trans woman"". 

So no, actually it's not on her at all to read his mind and somehow magically know that he would be disgusted if he knew she was trans. That's actually not the assumption to make at all, because most people aren't hateful bigots who are disgusted by the thought of touching or kissing a trans woman, especially if they're that sexually free that they'd kiss random strangers in a bar without getting to know them first. The assumption is that he's approaching her because he's cool. Obviously he's not, but she wouldn't have any way of knowing that from the way he was acting. She was deceived just as much as he was. If she had known he was disgusted by trans women, then obviously she wouldn't have been receptive to his advances and she also would've kept her identity hidden. 

Also, what part of ""being disgusted by the fact that she's trans and he kissed her"" tells you that he doesn't consider trans people disgusting? If he wasn't so fragile, this would've just been a funny story to tell his friends. But he considers it an abomination to kiss a trans person. So yeah, he kind of does consider trans people to be disgusting. It's very similar to finding out she's a non-white immigrant and then being disgusted because you thought she was a white US citizen. That's on YOU for thinking that. She has no way of knowing you'd be disgusted if you knew she wasn't white, how is she supposed to know you're a racist piece of shit? That's not a normal assumption people make about others. Similarly, this trans woman had no idea that he was transphobic and literally ""disgusted"" with her kissing him. Because that's not a normal assumption to make!! You act like ""well, she should've KNOWN that he'd be disgusted if he knew!"" 

I'm not trans, but if I was, you expect me to just assume that anyone and everyone I come into contact with who pursues ME, approaches ME, wants to kiss ME, would be disgusted if they knew I was trans, so I should out myself to them before we kiss? Get lost dude."
1,"I think my roommate is trans I think my roommate is trans

A little backstory before I get into it: I’m a 20 year old guy, and so is my roommate. We became friends recently, we’re both college students, sharing a dorm at a fairly liberal college, it’s in my home state. He grew up in a conservative Christian family and moved across the country to be here. He told me early on that it felt strange at first because it was so different from what he was used to. The first few weeks we were roommates sucked. He came off as a bit of a dick, he made some questionable comments, didn’t clean up after himself and he always did homework at like midnight with the light on. We have fixed these problems now. But one day, he vented to me about how one of the required classes for his major was doing a bit on LGBTQ history, and he wasn’t happy about it. I don’t know if it was how I look or how I play a lot of ‘masculine games’ and shit or whatever but he apparently thought I was on board. So I took the chance to tell him I was trans, and he was fairly shocked, which I can tell you felt pretty good because he told me he couldn’t tell. Anyways it was pretty awkward after that for a while but a week or two later he saw me playing a game he liked and I guess that was enough for him to get over it because he watched me play for a while and then he apologized to be for complaining about the assignment and he told me that he hadn’t met anyone trans or anyone gay, and he said I was nothing like he had been taught. And long story short we’re friends now. 
Now to the actual story: After finals, I decided to take my roommate to see I Saw the TV Glow as a little treat. It was playing in a small indie theater in town, and I’d heard about it from a friend who saw it when it first came out. They told me it was about a trans girl, so I thought it might be an interesting watch, and maybe even good for my roommate to see. What my friend didn’t tell me was how absolutely devastating the movie is. It's a pretty hard watch, not because it's bad but how visceral everything is. Safe to say the car ride back to our dorm was absolutely silent and we both cried a bit.
But in the weeks since we saw it he hasn’t really bounced back to his usual self. He’s been sticking around campus over winter break since it’s too expensive for him to fly back home, and I invited him to a family gathering because I didn’t want him to spend the holidays completely alone. He seemed okay there, but after that, he slipped back into being unusually sullen and withdrawn.  
A day or so after we saw the movie, I had asked him what was wrong. He only said, “It was a pretty intense movie.” which is true, but since he still wasn’t back to normal a week later I began to feel like there was more to it than that. Now, I don’t want to overanalyze this, but I can’t shake the feeling that watching it might’ve made him realize something about himself.  
There have been a few moments that make me wonder if he’s grappling with his identity. For one, I remember him getting visibly uncomfortable when someone casually asked him what he identified as. At first, I chalked it up to his conservative upbringing. But now, I’m not so sure. He also always chooses female characters in video games, which I think some people do to like see tits or whatever but he’s not really like that. I remember finding him painting his nails one time, which I really don’t care about, but I could tell he did because he started laughing about how stupid it was, he has also gotten almost frozen when we met a trans woman at a party, like he was impressed out at how good she looked but shocked that she was trans, and again I thought it was because his family is weird, but I have come to a different conclusion now. 
Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but if there’s even a chance he’s questioning or coming to terms with something, I want to be there for him. If anyone could offer some advice at all that would be great. I also posted this in r/trans and it got removed for some reason, but to be clear I am also trans."
1,"Hi, FtM here (girl to boy transgender), and first of all, you’re already being an amazing father by just merely supporting her- if she came out to you, that shows just how much she trusts and loves you. If it was a matter of you finding out from something like one of her friends accidentally forgetting to deadname her in front of you, or something along those lines, don’t take this as offense or she not trusting you, but rather her being scared of all the horror stories she’s heard online or on the news of parents kicking out/disowning/sometimes even attacking their children after they come out, a lot of the trans communities around the world are going through dark times indeed.

For the next while, adapt as best as you can to her new name and pronouns. I know this part will be a bit difficult, not because of lack of acceptance, but because you have to retrain your muscle memory after you’ve been calling someone you’ve known for more than a decade by a different name and set of pronouns. As long as you correct yourself whenever you say something wrong, she will understand. If she corrects you, know that she just wants to help you get used to it, as opposed to her trying to ‘call you out’ or something among those lines.

If she is below 18 (or just under your care financially), and you can afford it, I suggest looking into a therapist that specializes in gender identity/LGBTQIA+ if she isn’t already seeing a therapist. Once you have gathered a few reputable therapists’ links, send these links to her and ask her if SHE would like to see any of them- ensure that these therapists aid their LGBTQIA+ clients through any mental troubles that may stem from the societal pressure of being transgender, as opposed to trying to get them to ‘conform’ to society or even covert conversion therapy. I don’t know the laws/healthcare in Australia/Queensland, so I don’t know how much it would be to get a good therapist, or how long of a waitlist there may be. And please keep in mind that not every therapist is an amazing one-size-fits-all psychologist, and she may go through one or two or five until she finds one that makes her feel comfortable and gives her good advice that she can really apply (personally, I went through TEN, but the one who ended up being perfect for me was the one I myself chose, not my parents who chose for me without letting me have a say!).

Know that it is NOT your obligation to pay for your daughter’s medical transition, but she will forever appreciate it if you do- if you are in a well-off place financially and can afford it easily, then definitely chip in if you can, but if you’re struggling with money, she will understand that you wouldn’t be able to pay for it all, especially if Australia healthcare is anything like USA’s, having to pay thousands out of pocket because your insurance doesn’t view surgeries/hormones as medically necessary…

As others have suggested, buying her clothes that she wants will definitely help with her confidence- if she doesn’t like going out to buy clothes because she doesn’t like trying on clothes as it causes her great self-esteem issues, then order clothes online for her from a company that will allow you to send back clothes if they do not fit, as long as the tags are still attached (which I believe nowadays is most big companies). Definitely ask her if she wants to go out to buy clothes with you (or, if she wanted to go with friends, if she wanted a bit of cash to pay for clothes), or if there’s any links to any clothes she wants that you could pay for online.

And as many have said, just being there for her through it all is the biggest thing any child could ask for. Know that there’s a chance that her identity may change if she’s not completely sure- she may be Non-binary, or agender, genderfluid, even just gender non-conforming cisgender, but let her know that you will love her regardless for who SHE is, and being her being queer wouldn’t change a thing. Listen to her wants, and what she thinks is best for her, and you’ll continue to be the number one father of the year!"
1,"I mean, I am in a different situation, a trans woman married to a trans man, but I transitioned first and had considered myself a lesbian before he had told me. I certainly feel like I can relate to what you're feeling right now.

I'm no expert in relationship stuff apart from being with my husband for 12 years now, but I'd say you reacted well.

For me, I similarly felt like I could never ever leave this person who I had spent 7 years with up to that point. I was also really upset and scared because I had, mistakenly, thought I was only attracted to women. 

That was a silly thing to be upset about - transition is a slow process and I had more than enough time to get used to it gradually. I still don't think I'm very attracted to guys but I love my husband and an certainly attracted to him enough to continue loving him. 

 My husband hasn't had top surgery yet, though he plans on it. I support him getting surgery, obviously, but I am going to miss his chest once he does. There's been more than enough time for me to say goodbye to them, though, and I'm excited to love him in a body that he feels comfortable in, even if I think I'll miss something now. From my experience thus far, my love for him has trumped every single concern I had in the beginning, so I'm not too worried about that one, either.

I think you are being much more supportive and loving than I was when I was in your situation. 
Honestly it sounds like you've already got it mostly figured out - you love them ostensibly for who they are as a person. & While gender does play a strong role in that, they'll still always be the person you fell in love with and married. There might be bumps on the way but that's natural for every relationship between people on Earth, ESPECIALLY the romantic ones. 

Is there anything in particular that you're worrying about? I think you're definitely on the right track, regardless, so keep up the love and support and I'm sure everything will turn out better than any of your fears.

Of course, us both being trans does make a difference in our situations. I was obviously already very familiar with what challenges arise from transition and the struggles that trans people (and our partners, cis or trans!) face in daily life. So maybe I had a bit of an advantage there, but regardless, it's likely going to be a huge learning experience for the both of you, so mistakes might happen on both sides. Again, it sounds like you're on the right track so I think you'll be alright. 

Something my husband mentioned to me to tell you is...keep in mind that if your partner does decide to transition publicly, you'll then be, ostensibly, a gay man. You can protest and claim to be bi, or try to make some ""AKSHULLY"" argument, but let's be honest, society in most places, even America, isn't really at a place to see men dating men as anything but homosexual still, unfortunately. It is something that I think would be good to consider, especially if you're going to promise to never leave, so you can prepare for whatever that may mean with your family and your career.

Someone else recommended therapy here. That's a good idea if you have concerns about the future & their transition. It didn't help me but if you have the spare income or health insurance, it probably won't hurt.

Best of luck, I hope for many years happily married between the two of you if that's what's right for the both of you, and best of luck to his transition. It can be hard but it's a lot easier with someone who loves you unconditionally, so I'm sure you'll be alright from what I've heard so far."
1,"I was raised by a TERF so when I was your age I unfortunately had a lot of similar bad opinions...and unfortunately also groomed (though not by a TERF), sorry you went through that shit too.

Don't beat yourself up about it, most teenagers honestly don't know up from down, I know that doesn't feel great to hear but anyone who's been a teenager knows how easy it is to be ignorant and misinformed as a teenager and will be forgiving when people grow out of that.

The thing about that kind of hyperfemininity is that cis girls do that stuff too. You can find cis girls who dress hyperfeminine, who lean into being ""cutesy,"" who self-infantilize, who like being called ""good girl"" (usually that's a kink thing...being a lot more out-in-the-open about kinks is common in the LGBTQ community more generally, there are some historical reasons for that with how all LGBTQ identities were seen as ""perversion"" anyway, causing us to ally with BDSM and kink and refuse to be ashamed of our sexuality--so some of the sexual TMI is more a general LGBTQ community thing rather than a transfeminine thing specifically).

I (AFAB nonbinary) had some hyperfem phase stuff as a teenager too. (I had some masculine stuff also as a teenager, I'm bigender so it's sort of to be expected.) I was into catgirls and drew pictures of lesbian catgirls and got sparkle-eyed over anime yuri and honestly if a trans girl dressed the way I dressed people would call it ""AGP."" (I assume if you were in the TERF rabbit hole you know what that is.) I had boxes of lingerie catalogs hidden under my bed, and sexy cheesecake art on my walls. Like I would have been the most cringe trans girl except I was AFAB so no one could say it.

There's a pretty broad spectrum of how women express femininity. Hyperfemininity, queer femininity, and all that terminally online nerd girl stuff is part of it--and cis girls do it too. And not only are a lot of the girls in these spaces you're seeing teenagers themselves, but a lot of them are also autistic (trans people *are* disproportionately likely to also be autistic, though of course not all of them are--I'd wager the terminally online nerds are an even higher percentage likely though) and autistics can have a harder time fitting in and coming off as ""normal"" and can often seem weird and ""extra."" A lot of my cringe ""extra-ness"" in how I presented my femininity is probably my own autism--and a lot of the nerdy cis girls who act similarly to these trans girls are probably also autistic.

My gf also doesn't necessarily *present* in some of these ways IRL (neither do a lot of the people on egg_irl for that matter--like my gf, they have body image issues) but she can be similarly nerdy, into the same aesthetics, says stuff like ""I relate, I also want to be an anime waifu,"" and she's cis. But she's queer and likely some variety of neurospicy--much like a lot of these trans girls.

I don't think it's transphobic to find some girl cringe--you're a teenager yourself, finding other teenagers cringe is basically your job. But ask yourself, if the girl behaving this way was cis, would you judge her exactly the same way?

I think it's also important to remember that just because this is the kind of femininity some trans girl somewhere online enjoys, doesn't mean she, or anyone, is saying ""this is what a woman is,"" or ""all women are like this, to be like this is to be a woman."" She's just *that kind of girl* herself--doesn't mean that's the only kind of girl. And there are cis girls who are also *that kind of girl*, but part of why we don't judge them the same way is because how they perform femininity isn't burdened with the expectation of ""show me what being a woman is to you."" They can just express themselves without it being seen as a statement on what womanhood *is*. So as long as they aren't *saying* that there aren't women who express other kinds of femininity, don't read that into their expression."
2,"Though the edit is in place, just some quick information.  In general, taking cross sex hormones suppresses, to some extent, your natural hormone production via a mechanism that is basically that your body recognizes that plenty of essential hormones are present and so it doesn't need to produce them at the same pace it might otherwise.  Many people, however, still produce a significant amount of hormones regardless.  As a result, many transgender people *also* take hormone-suppressing medication.  (For transfems, that is usually a drug called spironolactone, and its anti-androgenic properties are just one of the many effects.  I myself take it for *high blood pressure*, for example.)

The other thing I want to correct is the perception of what puberty blockers *are* and, importantly, *why they are used*.  To start, puberty blocking is actually an edge case use of that entire class of drugs and they are more commonly used to treat certain types of cancer, interesting reproductive issues, and so on.  Their function is multi-staged but to make it as simple as possible, they discourage the body from producing sex hormones.  The do so by entirely different routes than, say, spironolactone, but the result is similar.  

What they are sorted, the reason why they are used for trans kids is the same as for cisgender kids suffering from precocious puberty:  they aren't *ready* for puberty, yet.  They are prescribed specifically to hold off puberty temporarily while the kid, their parents, and the doctors sort through the difficult question of whether they would be better served going through their natural puberty or one governed by HRT.  

Buying time is *important* because until puberty, the secondary sex characteristics do not yet come into play.  As those characteristics develop, they are often *irreversible*, or can only be reversed by a difficult process such as surgery.  An example of essentially irreversible is anything to do with bone development.  Bones don't ungrow once they grow and methods of addressing this are so wildly invasive, difficult, and painful to recover from that doing so for gender affirming reasons is irrational to the point of arguable malpractice were it attempted.  (And only some bones qualify for this anyhow.  No doctor in the world is going to remove chunks of your rib cage to make for a smaller chest, for example, given the risk of complications that pretty handily include all kinds of unpleasant ways to die!)  Bones work the other way as well.  Once they stop growing, they cannot be compelled to do so again, so if you're 26 and standing at a stately 160 cm, no amount of testosterone is likely to make you taller.  In other cases there are options such a ""top surgery"", FFS, laser or electrolysis and so on.  Some of these are expensive, specialist treatments that are difficult (to say the least) to come by.  Going through the ""wrong"" puberty gives all sorts of problems that one might want to expensively and painfully correct somewhere down the line.

And so enter puberty blockers.  Those buy time for softer social types of transitions:  new names, pronouns, wardrobes, hairstyles, and the like.  See how that fits, see how gender separates out former peer groups, and give the essential information required to make this difficult choice with some confidence that it is the correct one.

With all that having been said...Assuming I am reading this right, HRT other than puberty blockers were made illegal for under 18s in the UK a while back.  As such, adding a specific provision against puberty blockers is, while heartless and intentionally, also entirely *sensible*.  While there is a mountain of evidence for puberty blockers for trans kids, the evidence that supports that falls of quickly as they age out and no one is particularly eager to study a question like ""Is holding off puberty until adulthood a net positive for transgender kids,"" especially when current medical consensus would tell you that holding of puberty that long is almost certainly a *very* bad thing.  In effect, if you cannot actually take that other path, the argument for buying time is, well, *moot*.  Which is to say that, shitty as it is, this is more clarifying something that was *already* the case."
2,"1. Puberty blockers are 100% reversible, TERFs lie about what they do. They've been used safely for decades to treat precocious puberty. Gender affirming care and transition mean different things at different sges. For pre-pubeacent children, it means therapy and possibly social transition. For early pubescent children it means puberty blockers as well as therapy and social transition. HRT is typically given to later age teenagers when it's clear they are going to need to transition. Children almost never receive surgery. Of the 300 or so gender affirming mastectomies each year, format example, almost all of them are done on cis male children with cynecpnastia. Forcing a person to go through the wrong puberty is cruel and is non-reversible. Imagine forcing a cis child to take HRT at puberty and when they protest telling them they are too young to make that decision themselves.
 

2. You are right, this was actually the same argument used to prevent lesbians from going in women's changing rooms in the past. Also, a man does not need to claim to be trans to go in the ladies room, there's not a guard posted. And if he assaults somebody in there, claiming to be trans won't protect him from the criminal consequences. Sexual assaults don't happen in the bathroom, and when it does it's almost always by cis males, in the men's room, and against cis males or trans people. Most sexual assaults that aren't between intimate partners and family/family frienda are done on the streets and in vehicles. Criminalizing trans women using the bathroom because cis men can't are doing rapes in streets is bonkers. Also, this forces trans men into women's changing rooms and bathrooms. Makes zero sense.
 

3. Transitional medical care is grossly understudied, but most of it confirms it's safety. A study a couple years ago showed that AMAB children who went on puberty blockers had lower bone density than AMAB boys who didn't, but not catastrophically so. If they started estrogen, they'd have the same bone density as cis females and if they desired their bone density would return to normal AMAB levels with time. TERFs have made a lot of hay lying about this, claiming it causes osteoporosis, and some of their conspiracy theories get down right Q-anon-esque.
 

4. There is no evidence for ""rapid onset gender dysphoria."" There is no huge wave of kids identifying as trans. All that's happening is that children now have the freedom to explore their gender in ways they couldn't before. Some of them end up being trans, many don't. That's why gender affirming care does not start with HRT, why WPATH has guidelines for AGE APPROPRIATE care. The only evidence for ROGD is a ""study"" where the ""researchers"" asked a bunch of transphobic parents from mumsnet how many of their kids friends were trans and they were like, ""All of them!"" It's all nonsense.

 
5. Gender affirming healthcare has a 1% regret rate, among the lowest of all categories of care. There is around a 5% detransition rate, but out of that 5%, almost all of them deteansitioned due to social pressures, not that they aren't actually trans. The number of detransitioners because they no longer feel trans, numbers in, like, the low hundreds, and many of those RE-transition at some point. But TEEFs are always trotting out the few dozen willing to go on the record and blame their doctors or their parents or the government or ""gender ideology"" or other trans people for what they went through. Detransitioners need the support of the community and the same considerations for medical care as anyone else. But banning trans care to protect them is going to hurt a group orders or magnitude larger.
 

6. Your mom is mistaken about what feminism is, probably because she's listening to JK Rowling. Radical feminism doesn't mean advocating for women to the exclusion of others. Imagine saying, ""feminism excludes men because they aren't women."" Feminism doesn't intrinsically exclude everyone, it advocates for the deconstruction of patriarchal gender norms that oppress women but hurt everyone. TERFs are almost invariably both SWERFs (sex work exclusionary) and ""white feminists."" That is, not feminists who are white, but feminists who center and prioritize white women's perspective, interests, and grievance. I'll bet if you accuse her of ""white feminism,"" she'll show her true colors pretty fast.
 

7. This one is the Cruz of their problem. I remember in high school in the late '90s, the kid of a prominent member of our community came out as gay. His parent basically disowned him, he became a pariah around town, and all I heard from the adults around me was, ""Oh his poor parents. How could he do this to them? How could he be so cruel? He clearly just wants to hurt them."" For a lot of parents, the greatest fear a parent has is their kid not turning out how they imagined. To them, the child's struggles are actually the parent's shame. This is narcism, it centers the feelings of a parent in their child's life, and anybody who would do that is a real POS."
2,"Why does the discomfort of a few prejudiced cis ppl get to dictate the safety of trans ppl? Why do we have to have empathy for their biased and discriminatory views but not for the trans women who would be forced to use the wrong bathroom? Forcing a trans woman to use the men's room puts her in the same danger u say these cis women feel, only this time there's an actual threat and not simply the feeling of discomfort. Again, there is no concrete reason to fear trans women in bathrooms, there's not a pattern of behavior that shows they cant be trusted in there. The media would not let us hear the end of it if there were. Furthermore, they used the same ""safety in women's bathrooms"" line about desegregation. White parents didn't want black girls in their daughters locker rooms and restrooms and they used the idea of ""safety"" as a cover for their prejudice. But was there an epidemic of black women assaulting white girls in the bathroom? No. And now it's seen as a black mark on the history of the west. Surely u could say the same ""the world doesn't revolve around u"" line about the minority of cis women who make a stink about trans women in the bathrooms? Isn't it selfish to prioritize their prejudice over the safety of trans ppl, who again, are statistically not a threat to them? I live in Los Angeles, literally nobody bats an eye at a non passing trans person in the facilities. Everywhere could be so accepting if ppl just chilled out about the bathroom thing and realized it's not as big a deal as the media makes it out to be.

Hrt (hormone replacement therapy) isn't like drinking or getting tattoos, it's more like getting chemotherapy or a prosthetic limb. It's not recreational, it's medicinal, so that's not an accurate comparison when we're talking about minors and hormones. Chemotherapy can have drastic effects on one's body down the road at any age. Do u think parents should have the right to deny their children cancer treatment just because they don't believe in it? I think children should have rights over their own bodies, whether they be cis or trans, but that's a different argument and not necessarily relevant, so I digress. Furthermore, cis children are allowed to have gender affirming care and nobody worries that they might regret it later on. Cis boys and teens with gynecomastia are allowed to have their breasts removed, cis girls are allowed to get breast augmentations before they're 18, and cis children of any gender are permitted to take puberty blockers as a way of treating precocious puberty. All of these procedures have drastic and permanent effects on their bodies. Why do we permit them for cis minors but not trans ones?

Additionally, while yes, there are a certain number of ppl who will begin medical transition who later realize it wasn't the right thing for them, u could find the same phenomenon of regret for literally every medical procedure. And in the case of gender affirming healthcare for adults and minors, the number of satisfied patients VASTLY outnumbers the amount of desistors. Of ppl who medically transition, between 95 and 99% report being much happier, less suicidal, and less dysphoric about their bodies. Only about 1% to 5% will stop their medical transition, and even then, most of them only stop due to external factors such as lack of finances or lack of familial or community support. Most of them eventually end up resuming their medical transition later down the road. So it's merely a fraction of the 1-5% of detransitioners who end up having been cis ppl who made a mistake. The regret rate for hip surgery is something like 20 or 30%, and yet we don't bar ppl from getting hip surgery just because 20 to 30% of patients regret undergoing it. It does not make sense to deny gender affirming care to the 95-99% of ppl, children and adults, who desperately need it and will have their lives improved by it simply because a fraction of 1-5% of detransitioners have regrets. (That's not to say we shouldn't also have empathy for the cis ppl who end up not being trans, they are as much a part of our story and community as any one of us. I have friends who fall into this camp, and yet they remain stalwart allies and advocates for us, even as they realize it ultimately wasn't what they needed for themselves.)

I would argue it is ideological bias, and not facts of reality, that is the reason for the UK clamping down on gender affirming care for minors. Every major trans healthcare organization internationally, such as WPATH, has condemned the Cass Report for failing to include trans perspectives and for being overall less than scientific, and yet both the Tories and Labour continue to use it to justify their actions against our community. It's been debunked to hell and back, yet they still insist on it. That's not right.

Thank u for reading and listening, u sound very open minded and I honestly and deeply appreciate u taking the time to seek out our point of view on these things. I am very happy to continue our discussion either here or over DMs if u like. Also, happy holidays 🎄"
2,"A Recent Post About How Children Shouldn't Be Able to Get Gender-Affirming Surgery Recently, someone posted on a subreddit about how they don't think children should be able to get gender-affirming surgery. I am a cis man, but I have always thought banning gender affirming surgery for minors is wrong because of how harmful that could be to some people (though it's very few and far between when minors do get gender affirming surgeries). Do I think there should be a process and steps to take before arriving at that kind of a decision? Of course. But should any and all gender affirming care be banned? Absolutely not, that will always be extremely harmful no matter how many detransitioners there are. People often try to use detransitioners as an argument against gender affirming care, which is a problem in and of itself but that's another topic. I wanted to share my thoughts on such things and see if you all can add to my current view or if a change in my view is warranted and in what way:

People in those comments are citing the potential harms of puberty blockers, hormone replacement, and the surgery.

Let's look at another medical example: your child gets an infection in the arm which has a 20% chance of becoming septic and killing them if we do not amputate their arm. This will forever change their life, so you need to make a decision as their parent, with the doctor's guidance. If you choose to amputate because you don't want to risk them losing their life, would you like it if people called you a ""child abuser"" or ""child mutilator""? If you chose to leave it up to fate and you didn't amputate, and then your child becomes septic and they either 1) Die, or 2) Barely survive and now they have severe medical problems for the rest of their life and they're severely mentally impaired.. you would wish that you had amputated their arm, and you'd never forgive yourself as that child's parent.

All this to say, in literally ANY medical decision a parent is forced to make for their child, you have to weigh the pros and the cons. The risks and the benefits. If the risks outweigh the benefits, then you should probably not perform the surgery. If the benefits outweigh the risks, however, and you think the chances of your child dying if you \*don't\* perform the surgery are high enough, then any parent worth their weight in salt would choose to perform the surgery. Obviously, that child will be affected negatively for the rest of their life--they literally don't have an arm because of you. But the alternative may have been much worse. And my question is, what percent chance of death would the child need to have for you to agree with the parent's decision to amputate? Is a 10% chance high enough? Or what about a 50% chance of death? When is it considered ""child abuse and mutilation"" to amputate versus ""necessary to save the child's life/health""?

And why should YOU--someone who is not this child's parent, someone who has no idea what situation the child is in, no idea what the parents have already tried and how hard they've worked to try and stop the infection from spreading without resorting to amputation, you, who has no medical expertise whatsoever, who is not a doctor, who is not a health professional—why should you have the authority to say ""no, that's child mutilation, and should always be banned, in every single case, because that child isn't old enough to consent to having their arm chopped off.""? Why should you have that kind of jurisdiction? Why should lawmakers have that kind of jurisdiction? Waving a wand and banning all amputations for children is so harmful and deadly, but these lawmakers are ""doing it for the children""?? When they don't even know what these children's individual situations are?? When these lawmakers have no medical expertise whatsoever, and they're not the parents of these children?? They're not doing it ""for the sake of the children,"" they're doing it to give THEMSELVES peace of mind! If they allow these surgeries to take place, then they feel morally responsible for them. But if they ban the surgeries, then all the child death and suffering that occurs as a result of that are just a ""secondary effect"" of the ban, and ""not the intended result"", so these lawmakers don't have to feel morally responsible for the harm that their ban has caused to children (and parents and doctors). They can have plausible deniability now because, in their minds, they banned something that would cause harm. So even if more children are suffering, and even if more children die due to their ban on gender affirming care, that doesn't matter to them because ""well, that's not the intended result"". 

In my opinion, your intent does not excuse your impact. You don't get to weaponize your ignorance and lack of medical expertise against a vulnerable population of people just to make yourSELF feel better. That's very callous and self-righteous.

If my child has been on puberty blockers, hormones, and therapy for years and years now, and their genitalia is the one thing that is causing them severe dysphoria to the point where I've had to resuscitate my own child 6 times now due to their 6 suicide attempts, how much longer should I wait as a parent? How many suicide attempts should it take before I finally say ""this is the only thing we haven't tried, and I'm desperate to save my child's life""? Or should I just watch as my child continues to commit suicide over the years until one day they finally succeed? At least then I can say to myself, ""well, I did the right thing because at least I didn't mutilate their genitalia,"" right? My child is now dead, but AT LEAST I didn't mutilate their genitalia. They would thank me, if they were still alive today. And all the transphobic bigots of the world thank me for my decision too, so I should feel content, right?

I think trans people's very existence in this world has been politicized by us cisgender people to where they've been dehumanized so much that cis people can't even see how such discussions (on whether or not parents should be able to make informed medical decisions with their doctors to save their children’s lives/health/wellbeing) continue to harm trans people and their families. I personally hate having to talk about this to bigots who are so ignorant on the topic yet somehow feel they have the right to make these medical decisions on behalf of trans people (even adults). 

And I hate having to paint such an extreme scenario with a child who has attempted suicide 6 times just to make them understand the severity of what they're advocating for when they advocate to ban something so universally and absolutely. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope I didn't upset anyone with how I talked so bluntly about this issue. "
2,"Thank you for coming here to ask for help, and seeing this nonsense for what it is. I’m going to speak to just the first point about kids on blockers and hormones, since I’m a parent of trans kinds. Surgery on trans kids is largely bogeyman nonsense, except for rare top surgery. And if people aren’t up in arms about breast implants and rhinoplasty for rich cis girls then we can put that one aside as transphobia altogether. 

Blockers are temporary, reversible, *pauses* on puberty. Cis and trans kids use them safely, for different reasons (precocious puberty versus giving kids time to understand puberty ramifications and make an informed choice about pursuing male or female hormones.) 

Trans kids largely start to understand their real gender either around age 2-4 (when they are able to start expressing preferences for clothes and toys and feel confused or frustrated by parental insistence on the trappings of their assigned-at-birth gender) or puberty (when panic hits because their body is changing in ways they realize they hate/feels fundamentally wrong.) For anyone who has been a parent, no woke parents are pushing kids to be trans and getting them onto hormones. We see how cruel the world is to trans people. We support our kids in their gender precisely because the alternative of living the wrong gender is actually WORSE. Also, as parents, I’ve never been successful in forcing my kids to play X sport or wear X outfit for an event if it felt uncomfortable or even leave the house for a non-preferred activity without a fight. Kids know what they want and know who they are. Can you imagine dressing a cis girl in overalls for years without rebellion if they’re actually a pink unicorn type kid? They’d resent you forever and maybe do makeup and change clothes at school. Kids KNOW what they want and who they are, even cis kids. And the incongruity is even worse for trans kids. Listening to the kids you have, and helping THAT kid thrive is key. 

Blockers pause puberty for trans kids, following a LOT of conversations and listening and therapy (for kids and maybe parents) and doctors visits and blood draws and general PITA expensive and degrading experiences. We don’t go into this because we want trans kids, but we want OUR kids to not feel wrong inside and suicidal and self-hating and depressed.

And the very critical reason that hormones should be blocked early and then kids should start cross-sex hormones in teen years is because puberty is irrevocable. My kids are on track to be 6’3” broad-shouldered, hairy men. Except they’re girls. And I can fully stop the irreversible trauma of them having hairy faces/bodies, broad shoulders, deep voices, etc and just looking like the women they actually are. They’ve told me who they are for 7 years now, never wavering. Blockers and teen hormones can halt some of the discrimination directed towards them from transphobia and halt all the gender-based self-hatred that would come from the living in the wrong body. Or at least, I can do that In dwindlingly few places right now. And I might be arrested or have my kids taken from me if i try to help them be the best version of themselves. It’s a panic that hangs over my head every day right now. 

And as for losing the ability to have biological kids, who cares?! Lots of cis people can’t have kids. Infertility is real for many many people. Childless by choice is real. Adoption is real. Gay marriage and surrogacy with the bio inputs from just one partner is real. There are zero guarantees in life and the maybe of biological kids shouldn’t decide your intrinsic, cellular-level happiness with yourself (or you might end up being a shitty sad parent when trapped in the wrong life anyhow.) Plus this focus on baby making is gross and regressive and part of the oligarchic push for wage slaves who fight among themselves so they don’t have enough power to resist. 

Others can answer your other questions here, but I just wanted to chime in to help you understand more on the nuances for yourself on kids and hormones. I don’t know if it will resonate with your parents, but I really appreciate you coming here for insight overall."
2,"Parent here, so I'll confine myself to the points that are relevant to parenting. 

>1. Puberty blockers and pre-adult transitioning. They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions. 

What they need to understand is that children *aren't* making medical decisions in a vacuum. They are reporting a problem - just like kids do with anything else that's bothering them. And then, just like with any other medical or mental health issue, the parents help them seek care. 

There are a lot of people on the right pushing the idea that schools are somehow ""transing"" other people's kids, implying that they are getting puberty blockers, hormones, and even surgery without parents' consent. *This is 100% false*. Schools can't give so much as a Tylenol without the parents' consent. 

Which brings me to the parents' role. Far from kids making irreversible medical decisions on their own - many parents *block* their minor children from accessing appropriate care, sometimes even basic social transition. Transness is not something most of us expect or immediately understand, and it can be hard to find accurate information. What's worse, over the past 8-10 years, anti-trans activists have been flooding the internet with misleading or completely fabricated ""studies"" to intentionally muddy the waters. 

>4. Peer pressure / mis-identifying dissatisfaction... example of 12 students from the same class all wanting to transition. 

One of the ""misleading studies"" I mentioned above was published in 2018 proposing a ""new diagnosis"" called Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD). It described exactly this phenomenon, and proposed that kids ""become trans"" because of a ""social contagion"". The study has been widely criticized for only asking for parent reports, among many other serious flaws. 

It's true that sometimes an entire friend group will ""suddenly"" come out as trans over a short time period. But this phenomenon has been noted for decades among LGBTQ youth. All the gay kids seem to ""find each other"" in school, even before they're consciously aware of what makes them ""different"" from the mainstream or what they themselves have in common. Then over time, they help each other figure it out, and eventually support each other's coming out process. The same thing is still happening, but greater awareness of the whole LGBTQ spectrum - along with access to information via the internet - enables these friend groups to be more accurate and nuanced with their self discoveries than we were back in the day. 

>6. Radical feminism. 

Ok, this one isn't about parenting but I am a feminist too. The thing is, once you fully accept the idea that trans women are women, all of the apparent tension between feminism and transness falls away. Feminism is about what we have traditionally labeled ""women's rights"". In actuality, these rights fall into two main categories - sex-based rights like abortion, and gender-based rights as a counter to misogynistic social systems. Without going into my whole essay-length spiel, breaking it down this way actually helps feminists examine and analyze oppressive systems in important ways. And the distinction between sex and gender is something that the trans community has brought to light. 

>7. A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma. My mom's friend has a trans son and is clearly struggling with it, apparently called it a 'daily trauma'. 

Yeah, your mom's friend is causing her own trama. Sometimes kids don't turn out the way we expected, and far too many parents can't cope with that. The son has merely accepted and embraced something about himself that conflicts with his mom's beliefs or worldview. People used to have these kinds of reactions to their kids coming out as gay too, and some still do today. Does that mean it was wrong of those kids to come out? Should they have remained closeted to keep their parents comfortable? Would that have made them straight if they pretended long enough? I doubt your parents would say so given your overall description of them. So why should a young man keep pretending to be a daughter for his parents' comfort? 

Being gay and being trans are different things, but they are treated in very similar ways by cishet society (hence the reason they are both included in the rainbow). They are both inherent traits that challenge our assumptions about human gender and sexuality. If your parents have successfully deconstructed their beliefs about one, they can use a similar process to deconstruct their beliefs about the other.

It would greatly benefit your mom's friend to actually connect with parents who are accepting. If she's on Reddit, r/cisparenttranskid is excellent. There are also groups on Facebook (Mama Bears, Mama Dragons, Serendipitydodah). And many local LGBTQ resource centers run support groups for loved ones of trans individuals. Often it only requires a small shift in perspective. As long as she is wallowing in anti-trans echo chambers or unaccepting peer groups, she's just going to dig herself deeper into her own denial and drive a wedge between herself and her son."
2,"Well, look. The whole question is really a political quagmire, with 99% of the ""controversy"" ginned up by bad-faith politicians who just want to score cheap political points. They don't really care of the cost of their point-winning strategy is borne by trans people.

But anyway, that soapbox aside: if we just look at it from a best-outcomes perspective, then no, I don't think children should be able to get gender affirming surgery either. Not as a rule. And I say that as a middle-aged trans woman who understands full well what living with dysphoria is like.

What I do think is that, like *any* surgery, it should be considered on a case by case basis in consultation with the child, the parents, the surgeon, and the child's mental health provider.

And 99% of the time or whatever, the decision should be ""I know it sucks, but it's better to wait until you're full grown.""

Because the reality is that GCS (assuming we're talking about bottom surgery, here) is a *big* deal. That's a major surgery, with significant, lengthy, and complex recovery. It requires significant attention to after-care to ensure best healing. For transfemme GCS where the patient wants a full-depth procedure, there's a commitment to daily dilation, which is time consuming and uncomfortable. *Every* day. The recovery and after-care concerns alone are not especially compatible with the level of follow-through and responsibility that most kids have. The odds of the kid *not* following all the post-op guidelines for long enough, and ending up with a complication or other bad outcome, are just too high. No matter how much the kid begs for it. It's kind of like ""Can we get a dog? Pleeeezzzzzeeee? I promise I'll feed it and walk it and pick up after it"" except with higher stakes. With a dog, when the kid inevitably flakes out, the parent can do it or can just give the dog away. With GCS, when the kid flakes out you end up back in the hospital needing more surgery. So no, I don't think most trans kids are actually ready to handle what GCS entails. 

Furthermore (as if that wasn't enough), these surgeries are a rapidly evolving field. I wouldn't call them experimental anymore, at this stage, but it's an area where new developments are still showing up with some regularity. Waiting means taking advantage of any improvements that happen within the upcoming 10 to 15 years (when the kid is full-grown and finally ready for it).

Also, doing GCS on a kid means reconfiguring tissues on a body that is *still growing*. And I don't think we have any good data on whether the reconfigured tissue is going to grow like it should afterwards. (Maybe there's data on this and I just don't know it. IDK.) If I was the parent of a kid asking for GCS, no matter how supportive I was, I'd still be pretty concerned about how that tissue and any surgical scarring is going to react over time, as the kid goes through their HRT-induced puberty and whatever final years of growth into adulthood that they have left. I would think it's probably better to wait until their body has reached full adult stature before GCS.

So yeah, it should be evaluated on a case by case basis, but in almost every case, the answer should probably be ""not yet."" Because also? Plenty of other good research data shows that kids who are supported in a *social* transition from an early age have much lower dysphoria and mental health outcomes that are more or less equivalent to age-peer cis kids. I.e. ""let your kid socially transition, and their dysphoria will probably drop to a level they can manage until they're old enough to handle getting GCS.""

But, once in a while you are going to find a kid who has such overwhelming, debilitating body-centered dysphoria that they need GCS anyway--despite the risks and challenges--as a matter of enabling them to function in their day to day lives. For those *very few* kids, yes, they ought to be able to get it. They shouldn't be forced to suffer until they turn 18 or whatever. But that's a decision that's going to be arrived at only after a *lot* (like, really, a LOT) of careful evaluation by the kid's parents, doctor, and psychologist. I worry less about that kid getting GCS than a run-of-the-mill trans kid getting it, too. Because that kid is *desperate*. If anybody's kid is going to comply with all the recovery and after-care requirements, it's going to be that kid."
2,"1.) You should NOT be forming such a strong opinion if you do not have an inkling of the scientific reasoning behind it. 

That said. I take 2 approaches. 
One. Puberty blocker is safe an reversible. Flat out. It has been a thing for cisgender kids for way longer for a reason. Because puberty blocker is there to buy time or to prevent WORSE THINGS from happening than 'bone density'.

When people say puberty blocker is dangerous, they mostly point to bone density. There's a very simple solution for kids who have weaker bones. Calcium and proper nutrition. That is it.

Two. People against transitional blockers argue that cisgender kids NEED it unlike trans kids due to precocious puberty.

The main reason we try to prevent precocious puberty is due to societal and in turn, personal damage early puberty could do.

Point in case, blockers are typically given to cis girls who are developing too fast to prevent increase in rape, bullying, and stigma- and in turn, worse mental health. 

Trans kids should not be discriminated against when the reasons are similar. Mental and overall well being of a child.


Now try to make an argument agaisnt cis kids getting in blockers. 


2.) This just does not happen. There's a reason why the right wing producer Matt Walsh had to pivot with the movie Lady Ballers.

Because unlike this narative that has been formed, trans women just want to live. 

Also, it's easier to encroach on women's spaces as a cisgender male. 



3.) And 5.)

Like with anything medical, there's going to be some risks involved. But this is why MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. came to a concensus that transitioning for gender dysphoria is the best solution. Because they tried other avenues and they were not as effective.

As for regret. HRT and transitioning is considered medical miracle due to the low percentage of regret rate. More people regret surviving due to getting a heart transplant than transitioning.


4.) As for peer pressure. Bigots call it peer pressure, others call it visibility. 

Why shouldnt kids be able to explore themselves including gender? If they figure out later that uts not for them, they can detransition.

Thats why we have puberty blockers and thats why the first step is social transitioning. To try it out.


6.) Your mom doesnt sound like she knows her feminism.

In US specifically, trans women were included since the 2nd wave feminism. Because even back then, people realized that excluding trans folks conceded a lot of points of feminism to cis men. 

Point being Imane Kaliff. Do you really want to be discriminated against and looked down by society as a woman because you happen to look a tad more masculine? It's a dangerous slippery slope of bigotry, transphobia, misogyny, and racism.


7.)

Frankly do not care. 

Imaging being trans in current day sociopolitics. Thats more traumatizing than having a kid turn out queer. 



To me. Your mom is not logical. She fell for propaganda that goes against everything medical professionals have been saying for the last couple decade."
2,"Well, there is a HRT mix that can do just that: 50mg of bicalutamide + 60mg of raloxifene + (after about 6 week) 12.5mg of cyproterone acetate + vitamin B12; daily.

In case you want more information: Bicalutamide is a testosterone blocker that works by blocking your T receptors. But it does not block your T production - in fact, your body starts producing more trying to compensate for perceived T shortage. Because bi doesn't cross blood-brain barrier to well, your brain is still exposed to T, preventing behavioral changes - you are still as horny, and manly as ever. (For the first few days after T levels rise, but before your brain gets used to it - even more than usual.) And because excess T metabolizes to E, among other things, and your body can’t access T, it alone is enough to start slowly feminize your body (but not brain). But no access to T, and low level of E are not good for you. It can cause low energy and osteoporosis, among other things.

Here comes the Raloxifene - it's a type of SERM, strengthening effects of E on your body (but not brain), weakening effects on breast (so no boobs), and preventing osteoporosis and other negative health effects. That solves most of the problems, but such high levels of T mean most of it gets turned into other T metabolite, DHT, which can lead to baldness, and no one wants to be a bald femboy.

So you add cyproterone, which is another T blocker, this time blocking T production. Normally it would just make it so there's no T in your body, but in combination with bi, it just brings your levels down enough to curb DHT production. That solves balding, but using cyp sometimes cause depression-like effects. This is prevented via B12.

Upshot - you end up with manly, T steeped brain in feminine, E shaped body."
2,">Puberty blockers and pre-adult transitioning. They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions.

A few things;

1. Depending on the laws of where you live in the world - children under the age of 18 are already allowed to make some medical decisions for themselves. In the UK this is sometimes called Gillick Competence. [Consent to treatment - Children and young people - NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/), [Gillick competence and Fraser guidelines | NSPCC Learning](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/child-protection-system/gillick-competence-fraser-guidelines). Children are understood by the medical system to be humans able to take some decisions of their own, have a say in their own lives while needing guidance and restrictions too. They are not property, neither of their parents nor the state.
2. They don't get given the right to make major unalterable decisions. That is why they are not offered hormones or most major surgeries - but instead offered puberty blockers which pause puberty. It can then be resumed by either stopping taking the blockers OR by administration of hormone replacement therapy (E or T) at a suitable age. [Puberty blockers for transgender and gender-diverse youth - Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075)
3. This decision is almost never made just by the child themselves. It is a course of treatment prescribed to the child with consent of the child, the parents and the relevant doctors.
4. The most negativity that they could whip up about this in very biased, but still ultimately following the scientific method, research was ""not enough evidence"" (after discarding evidence that isn't double blind placebo trials - which aren't really applicable to this field because it is hard to lie to a child and say ""your puberty is blocked"" while they can visibly see and feel their body changing). That is not a clear case for ""stop it forever"", that is a case for ""we need more research""... which everyone agrees with! Let sunlight be the disinfectant of misinformation - and if it agrees with the research that has already happened (showing safety, efficacy and reversibility) then we will resume the best course of treatment we already have. [Ban on puberty blockers to be made indefinite on experts’ advice - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ban-on-puberty-blockers-to-be-made-indefinite-on-experts-advice)

None of this requires other people, or the state, sticking their nose in other people's business over it.

>Medical dangers of transitioning.

Children only take these medications for a short window and thus long-term effects do not come into play. Any and all risks are weighed by the child, parents and doctors as a team.

Adults are informed of any risks we know of (thus why it is called ""informed consent"") and choose to follow this path anyway.

In both cases - it is not for anyone else sticking their nose in to decide for them.

>A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma. My mom's friend has a trans son and is clearly struggling with it, apparently called it a 'daily trauma'. I can't help but not give a fuck about that 'trauma', but any literature on this matter might help.

I have seen this be described by parents and partners of trans people in a few ways. Sometimes they feel grief and as if their child/partner is dead. I don't quite get it - but I think it deserves empathy and those dealing with it deserve a way to navigate it. After a bit of searching just now I found the term ""Ambiguous Loss"".

[Ambiguous loss: dealing with the loss of a child who is transitioning gender – Offspring Magazine](https://offspringmagazine.com.au/parenting/ambiguous-loss-dealing-with-the-loss-of-a-child-who-is-transitioning-gender/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20normal%20to%20experience%20grief%20when%20a%20child,a%20transgender%20child%20to%20the%20process%20of%20transitioning.)

I think the concepts of ""grief"", ""death of a loved one"", ""trauma"" and ""daily trauma"" are all the same emotion - and each is an unhealthy way to process it.

Thus perhaps introduce to them (and the friend maybe) this idea of Ambiguous Loss as a better way of explaining and coping with the feelings they are feeling.

Good luck <3 :)

 Part 3/3"
2,"1. Puberty blockers prevent permanent changes from puberty. For one example, if a trans boy gets on puberty blockers early enough, they won't need to seek a mastectomy later in life. Puberty blockers give people time to make decisions, and are safe to stop taking at any time to resume puberty.
2. There is so much wrong with this, but I think maybe the best thing to point out is how anti-trans policies lead to masculine women getting assaulted and harrassed out of bathrooms way more than it affects trans people. There are some news stories you can look up to help with that point.
3. There aren't really any long term health risks associated with transitioning. There are studies out there, but results kinda depend on what you choose as your control group. For example:
   * [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589936822000111](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589936822000111)
   * ""Overall, the available data indicate that transgender women on GAHT are at a higher risk of ischemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction) compared with sex assigned at birth women, however transgender women appear to have similar cardiovascular risk when compared to sex assigned at birth men.""
   * Additionally, there isn't really one single method of transitioning. For example, there are different drugs, and different routes of administration. Pills can be associated with higher risk of blood clotting, but these days doctors are smart enough to only prescribe those to people with other good vital signs to reduce the risk, so it really isn't a problem.
   * That bone stuff sounds very weird though. Is she somehow getting trans women mixed up with post-menopausal women? It would probably be worth calling that out.
   * As per this review, there are mild improvements to bone health: ""Estrogen therapy has a positive correlation with trabecular bone score and bone mineral density in the lumbar region of transgender women but not elsewhere""
4. I have yet to see any evidence of that, but keep in mind anecdotes aren't statistics. Queer kids tend to group together for hopefully obvious reasons, so it's easy to get the wrong impression if you expect perfectly evenly distributed kids.
5. This comes from the mistaken idea that the alternative to transitioning is being 'normal'. It's not. The alternative is heavy depression, suicidality, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse issues. Transitioning isn't about making life perfect, it's about making like better, which countless studies have shown it succeeds at.
6. Judith Butler I hear is a good author. You could also ask her why TERF groups keep siding with anti-feminist anti-abortion religious fundamentalist groups if they're so feminist [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands\_Across\_the\_Aisle\_Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_Across_the_Aisle_Coalition)

I hope this helps, but honestly you should try sharing wholesome positive stories of trans people transtioning. Cold hard facts are one thing, but it might help more than anything else to remind her that trans people are human too, with stories and needs and feelings just like her. Best of luck."
2,">They are against under-18s being allowed to make these kind of decisions.

Rather defeats the purpose of **puberty blockers**, which have been in use for precocious puberty for decades without serious adverse effects. Also, children under the age of majority DON'T get to ""make this decision"", it's a decision made in concert with their parents and physicians.

As for medical ramifications, puberty blockers are shown to be safe if used as intended (for a short period of less than two years).

>Trans women in cis female spaces (the classic bathroom/changing room debate). They insist this poses dangers to cis women.

There is absolutely nothing to support this statistically. Yes, the same arguments were made around lesbians in women's spaces, and also around **black women** in women's spaces. It's ancient repackaged bigotry.

> But they also said that a predatory male could just declare themselves a woman and enter freely.

Untrue, and there's also nothing stopping predatory males from entering bathrooms anyway. A male willing to break the social taboo on social predation isn't going to be stopped by bathroom stigma.

>I also pointed out that trans women would face much higher dangers in cis male spaces, but they simply said 'there are more cis women'. 

Your parents have freely admitted they are willing to let a statistical minority suffer sexual and physical assault over a hypothetical fear rooted in no statistical evidence whatsoever. This is a rather startling self-report. USUALLY people with an ounce of moral fiber/self respect will backpedal or prevaricate when presented with the question of ""what are trans women supposed to do"", not just say ""fuck it, there's less of them"".

>Medical dangers of transitioning. Specifically some shit about bones crumbling. Scientific articles I have found dispute this, no idea where that came from. 

Osteoporosis can occur in the absence of sex hormones, which is really only a problem if HRT is taken away from a trans person who has already undergone GAS.

>Peer pressure / mis-identifying dissatisfaction. Saying a lot of youth are simply buying into the hype and misplacing typical angst with gender dysphoria.

""Social contagion"" specifically came from Lisa Littman, who evidenced her theory by polling transphobic parents from explicitly transphobic online communities such as ""transgender trend"". Notably, being gay and bisexual in the early 80's was also called ""a social contagion"". This is, once again, just repackaged bigotry. Further, the term ""contagion"" was chosen deliberately, in an attempt to intuition pump the listener into believing something alarming was going on. Another, less provocative term would be ""idea"". All ideas are ""contagious"", that's literally how the transference of knowledge works. Including their newly discovered, nascent transphobia.

>Regret. 

Specifically and eternally when this subject is raised, they are saying ""I would happily see a million trans children end their lives to save one cis child from potential regret"". Regret is part of life, the regret rate based on current gatekeeping standards is exceptionally low, and they are locking onto lurid outliers that are signal boosted by conservative media because it confirms an implicit bias.

>Looking for literature that examines trans women in feminism.

I would go to r/askfeminists for this.

>A bit tenuous, but - parental trauma.

Having a trans child is indeed tough for parents, especially during an ongoing moral panic. I have a friend with a trans child and she went through a lot of fear and grief, but she fiercely defends her daughter and would die to protect her rights. I have all the time in the world for parents struggling with this, but very little patience for those that let it fuel bigotry."
2,">I looked into puberty blockers but they seem expensive and stop erections which might not be what he wants(he is in a serious relationship)

You can't give puberty blockers to a 16 year old, it would be really bad. A 16 year old needs sex hormones whether it's testosterone or estradiol, starting HRT at 16 is safe if he wants it but definitely not blockers or anti-androgens without hormone replacement

> Estrogen from what I understand grows breast which can be permanent (which he does not want) 

Yes that's the point. And yes they are permanent, they can only be removed with surgery.

>Another concern for either is the mood changes! He is already struggling with mental health, adding to it might not be the smartest idea.

In my case HRT helped with my mental health, mood changes are often overrated, you have nothing different than what a woman normally has.

>no facial hair

You have to wait for it to fully develop and then remove it with laser and electrolysis, unfortunately doing it before would be a waste of money without HRT because the presence of testosterone would make the hair grow until the beard development is complete (\~23/25 years)

>My son is a Fem-boy 

From a former femboy, he is only 16 years old and will change a lot as he grows up. My timeline was like this:

* 10-14, I had tendencies towards femininity but I suppressed them for fear of being gay.
* 14-15, I started being a closeted femboy
* 15-17, I started being a straight femboy in public
* 17-18, I started questioning my gender, for the first time I suffered from dysphoria due to my developmental progression
* 18-21, I started identifying as non-binary femboy
* 21-22, started the process to get HRT because of the dysphoria that was too strong. I didn't want breast growth yet but I considered it less important than the dysphoria I felt because of male development
* 6 months ago, started HRT
* Now, I identify as a woman. I have breasts now and I love having them, in the end the whole problem was caused by some form of denial/social anxiety

Try to help him and don't judge him if he changes his mind, it's already difficult to accept that I was wrong. Sometimes I find it difficult to admit that I was wrong and didn't fully understand what I really wanted.

It's not easy."
2,"a ""period"" is a lot of things happening in a woman's body centered around fertility and hormone cycling. As pointed out by the overconfident moron below, trans women do not have a uterus obviously, so some parts of what happens won't take place, like shedding the lining of an organ you don't have.

On the other hand, the rest of your body has no way of knowing that you don't have a uterus, and the hormone signals in your body still make it think you have a woman's body (because you do) so sometimes people will still experience some of the secondary period symptoms. For instance, the abdominal cramping that women tend to experience is primarily in the uterus, but not only there. Those cramps are caused by chemical signals telling the smooth muscle tissues to release prostaglandins, and the uterus is not the only place those signals end up going. This is why it's very common to experience ""the period shits"" and intestinal cramping as well as the classic uterine cramping.

>There are several typical period pain causes:

>First, during menstruation, the uterus contracts to expel its inner lining (the endometrium). As a result, the blood vessels are compressed, which causes a temporary lack of oxygen and provokes the discomfort.

>Second, throughout the menstrual cycle, uterine tissues accumulate prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that intensify uterine contractions. The higher the level of prostaglandins, the more severe the pain. Prostaglandins accumulate in other smooth muscle tissues, for example, in those of the bronchi or intestines, which is why painful periods are often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  
  
\-Excerpt from [This Article](https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/health/period/period-pain-relief)

Personally I get the diarrhea, intestinal cramping, mood changes (irritability, way worse anxiety), hormonal migraines, sometimes a random other symptom or two depending on the month.

... if someone wants to call all the other aspects of a period (other than the bleeding) something besides a period, they are welcome to. Certainly this is not something that happens to every trans woman. But I'm not interested in being told I have to use separate language and terminology when I experience something very normal and typical of an adult woman.

Here's [another link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230128162842/https://curvyandtrans.com/p/C4BD87/cycle-dynamics) that goes into a lot more depth on the subject. I did have to use the way-back machine to find an archived copy because the original site is apparently offline now."

3,"Ex-fundie here.  Christians, even within specific denominations and stuff, aren't actually super-consistent with their beliefs on a lot of stuff, and this is one of those things.  My extended family - mostly Pentecostals - spans the range from not speaking to or acknowledging me at all, to saying they disagree with my 'lifestyle' but will gender me correctly after my 'sex change', to begging me not to get the 'sex change' and saying that it'll make me an abomination unable to enter heaven (apparently I won't be ""in God's image"" anymore)

This is because of a combination of two things: that fundamentalists are moral prescriptivists, and that their holy book doesn't prescribe them a clear moral standpoint on trans people. 

While a lot of people, even religious people outside of fundamentalism, arrive at their moral and ethics through a variety of processes (usually a sliding scale from ""what I was taught by my parents/culture"" to ""what's good for me and those I love"" to ""what is right and best for my society/culture"" or ""what does the greatest good/harms none"" as one matures) and people usually figure out their moral and ethical boundaries through observing role models, learning how their actions impact others, and through critical thinking - people within fundamentalism arrive at their morals in an entirely different way.  Their hierarchy is entirely built on what they've been instructed is right:  their primary source being their religious text, and then their other sources being their religious leaders and their father (or husband, or man of the household).  If their religious texts don't say anything about trans people, then they rely on messaging from their pastor.  If their pastor has never preached on it (and manipulated unrelated scriptures to create a stance/take on the subject), and they've not heard other preachers in their denomination give a clear message on it, then they're basically gonna be left with whatever bottom-of-the-barrel dregs of bigotry they may've picked up from other men in their church or family.  And then, beyond that, they have to do something they're very much not used to:  critically thinking and forming their own moral stance.  And they're not good at that.  Because that's *not usually allowed* in fundamentalism - that's how you end up with people having independent thoughts, you know?


So yeah.  That's how you end up with fundiea having wildly inconsistent morals.  They're getting it all from a primary source that's actually dozens of different books all badly translated and mispackaged as religious doctrine, preached by guys who have mantras like ""if the Bible says it, God says it, and I believe it!"", and they have to navigate the world based on that and with as little independent thought as possible.

Of *course* they're confused when they see someone being free and living their life in a way that's not even talked about in the Bible."
3,"I don't think Christians hate trans. I think that it is the evangelicals that are promoting the hate.  Christians, I think , are taught the teaching of Jesus Christ. Who said that it is best to love each other and to love as you love yourselves.  I think Evangelicals go more for the old testament, where it says a eye for an eye, and all that. and they think that the bible is the exact word of God.  The Bible was written by man.  Man wasn't around when the dinosaurs were created. and they were here on this world.  They aren't mentioned in the Bible.  God created the universe as it is.  He might have snapped his finger, ( which goes with the big band theory of how the universe was created).  He created man, but it was a slow process.  God, I think is very subtle. He is slow to bring about change.  He sent his son, Christ to die for our sins.  I have always had a hard time with this.  If you have a child,, and you are proud of that child as he has grown, It would be very hard to let harm happen to him.  I think Christ taught that we should love one another.  Very easy thing to learn.  Be kind to one another and we should believe in him.  But, that lesson doesn't carry as much weight if it just a guy telling us to be nice to each other.  remember God is subtle,  Christ has to get peoples attention.  He does miracles, that gets peoples attention,  Christ didn't hang out with all the people that were in power of the church.  He was in the thick of sin, to help save our souls. 

We are humans, we have behaviors that I don't think have changed for thousands of years.  In baseball, do you think that you could still go to a museum and see the baseball that Babe Ruth hit his last homerun with?   yeah, I think you could. could you get a baseball in the gift shop there that had a stamped impression of Babe Ruth's autograph on it?  Maybe.  See, the thing is that people tend to keep things that are significant to them.  I imagine that somewhere someone kept pieces of the cross that Jesus died on.  Now, there are replicas of that cross every where.  Just like back when Christ was alive, there were religious leaders that felt threatened of losing their power.  just like the evangelicals now.  Sometimes I think that there is a big Ponzi scheme going on in some churches.  Let's face it money is power.  

Short story is, Christians don't hate Trans.  I'm a Christian, and I think I'm trans."
3,"The common thread isn’t Christianity, tho it does seem like it 

There’s probably a term for this but ya know how sometimes we have authoritarian leaders but the people following them don’t see them as an authoritarian leader and would regularly profess to not being pro authoritarian? Whatever you call that kind of person, they’re the common thread. Just so happens a lot of them are Christian’s

From a sociological and theological perspective it could be considered fascinating if it weren’t so terrifying. Probably will seem morbidly fascinating in like 1-2 hundred years. But it might not even be Christianity’s fault as much as it just so happened that a few unfortunately clever Republican strategists (tho that wasn’t everyone’s job title) figured out how many Christian’s there were in the country and that a lot of them didn’t vote. 

I’m not certain that’s where the term silent majority comes from, but for some reason it fits right. Wouldn’t surprise me. So anyway they started campaigns to manipulate Christian’s into associating Christian values with the Republican Party. Not exactly a grand conspiracy, just a bunch of assholes being assholes at the same time

Back in, I wanna say the 70’s, Christians by and large were pro choice, but a lot of them were pretty racist and not a huge fan of desegregation. Anyway it was the way back then’s version of the westboro baptist church that started a campaign that to the lay person seemed like it was protecting wittle itlle babies, but to anyone really listening was actually about encumbering people of color with children they hadn’t planned and weren’t prepared to raise. But connecting it to the Christian value of not murdering associated with infants was, unfortunately, brilliant. 

It did a lot of work to connect the two parties. Then you know how I said it’s not a real conspiracy just shity people being shity. Well the ability to gain power by manipulating folks like this was very attractive to horrible people. So the Republican Party flipped. What once argued against slavery became the preferred home of anyone with a really shitty thought. 

But abortion didn’t work as the it issue for republicans very long. It still had weight but it wasn’t turning any tides. Some of the shitty people involved in the politics of it(like not the general public) figured out that what is even more effective for wrangling republican voters than the abortion issue is the stuff hitler was doing right before the camps. Just blame it on a small group that most of your voters have too little exposure to truly know anything about, but just enough exposure that when you tell them that ____ marginalized group is coming for your ______. 

That was the game for decades. More and more money got involved. Eventually there were only like 6 real democrats, and more importantly the republicans needed Latinx votes. So they stopped spitting a lot of their previous horrifying rhetoric against Latinx people. They’d already had to stop being raciest against African Americans out loud, and for most of the politicians the racism is purely performative, so why not?

The only problem was, who’s left? They tried just with gay people in general but that didn’t really work. Tons of straight people knew at least one gay person well enough to know that they don’t eat babies. I’m sure you can see where this is going. We were the perfect target for politically weaponized hateful bigotry. We’re one of the smallest marginalized groups, ton’s of bull shit about us is still established in the public consciousness, and we started getting seen more. More trans kids then anytime in like maybe 2000 years, I’m honestly not sure, we’re growing up without feeling so afraid that it would keep them in the closet. It was easy to point at the fact that more of us are out of the closet being ourselves and call it the liberal left wing media warping your children

That’s most of why Christianity is involved generally, and a decent explanation for why the right wing is attacking our rights. Unfortunately for trump it’s probably real bigotry and not just a performance. But the overall issue is fairly complicated

All that said It’s worth pointing out, it has not always been like this. We used to be celebrated as magic by cultures. We were shamans. They saw how we cross a gender line they could fully understand crossing and instead of freaking out they were like “holy shit, Kyle looks awesome”, “it’s Kelly now”, “Oh shit. Fuck. My bad. Kelly’s hot”

That little skit was a joke. But it’s no joke that even though there’s been bigotry coming at us for a long time, there is ZERO reason for it. Society isn’t against us. Some people are just simple, and other people are the kind of evil that takes advantage of that. We are literally just caught in the cross fire"
3,"I believe anyone who does not make the effort to try and not hate people is not really a Christian. While you’re saved by your faith, if you really had that faith, you’d believe god is god, right all the time and all powerful. How could you be a Christian and not try and do as god commands you? While you’re saved by your faith, would you really love god if you were hating one another? God commanded people to love each other, so by not doing that, or at least not trying, you are not doing as god says, but using him as an excuse for forgiveness. To me this does not seem like a love for God.

“Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied: “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.””
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭22‬:‭34‬-‭40‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.”
‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭4‬:‭8‬ ‭NIV‬‬

It’s also written that if you don’t forgive others, God won’t forgive you.

“For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6‬:‭14‬-‭15‬ ‭NIV‬‬"
3,"Thing is they are claiming to be something they aren’t. Christian = Christ like. I am no longer a believer but I’ve read that book cover to cover and do they act in any way like Jesus was said to in Matthew, Mark, Luke or John? No. Who do these people remind you of? They remind me of the Pharisees. And how often was Jesus telling them that were wrong? And why the strict reliance on the Old Testament while ignoring Jesus’s teachings 

There are real Christians out there. These people aren’t them. So while they are officially referred to as things like Christian Nationalists I call them Modern Day Pharisees or MDP for short.

These people claim something that Jesus tells
Them they can’t do. Know the will of God. Even the basic attributes of God for example “God can do anything” okay, so why believe that God can’t or won’t make LGBTQIA people intentionally? Jesus commanded his followers to love others but you can see they don’t.

They don’t think from a christ like standpoint. Sermon on the mount Jesus did a miracle to ensure everyone who came was fed. But they don’t want children to be provided with meals at school. )which has the consequence of impacting children’s ability learn) 

They also don’t take into consideration consequences. When doctors said women will
Die if we can’t intervene in life threatening situations they didn’t care. They still threatened to jail doctors. 

So like In the other cases they stick to some non-existent but perceived “law” in the Bible is what they attempt to force on others, making them no better than groups like the Taliban."
3,"> Meanwhile progressive Christians will find you biblical texts that support the acceptance of trans people

So, I'm Lutheran, and just to prove a point, here's how one of the most famous ""anti-homosexual"" proverbs could be genuinely misconstrued.

Leviticus 18:22
> Hebrew (literal): “And with a male you shall not lay lyings of a woman.”  
King James: “Thou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination.”  
New International: “Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.”  
Living Bible: “Homosexuality is absolutely forbidden, for it is an enormous sin.”

That's... some leap from the Living Bible. ""Homosexuality"" is certainly one reading -- one which the Living Bible is *more* than happy to place there -- but it's not the intended reading, I don't think. The New International version is certainly more correct to the original translation (as is the New International Version's intention.)

Two things stick out to me. One, Leviticus *is basically ignored in modern days anyways.* This is the book that defines how people should behave, and features quite a lot of ""laws"" that you'll find a hard time having any Christian follow to-the-letter. Like not wearing mixed clothing, not to mix crop fields, don't show favoritism, don't slander, don't eat meat that has blood in it, don't wear tattoos, respect the elderly, and don't withhold wages of people you hire, don't eat imported fruit unless it's exactly 5 years old, if you cheat on someone you should sacrifice a ram in front of a priest's house, etc. Basically all of those get ignored by a lot of Christians. Eating a hamburger cooked anything less than well-done is a sin, but you don't see anyone talk about that, eh? Love me a good medium to medium-rare burger.

Two, and probably more important; Women back then were treated as less than men. Taking into account, if we use the first instance of man to mean ""equal"" and the instance of woman to mean ""lesser"", ""Dot not lie with an equal as one lies with a lesser"" is a much clearer law, which doesn't rely on using ""lie"" to mean ""sex"", but rather any kind of mistreatment -- including *literally* lying. You shouldn't mistreat someone you are equal in social status to. That's more inline with the rest of the bible's teachings anyways, and is along the lines of loving thy neighbor, which *is* the second-most-important law, above all others."
3,"I think about this a lot because I transitioned in the late 80s-early 90s and while we weren’t loved by any stretch, I never saw the level of hate we experience today.  I lived in Va and Fla during that time and never had any issues with medical providers or others I told that I was trans. I’m very worried about this now.  

So why do people hate us?  I see three main reasons:

1.	⁠Certain Christian denominations have become **obsessed with the Old Testament** and are teaching their faithful that trans people are sinners defying God’s plan for our lives (and the country is suffering from God’s displeasure). There is so much theologically wrong with this, but I’ll just summarize it saying this viewpoint ignores Christ’s actual teachings.  Their hate also makes them feel powerful and righteous. (No doubt like the men Jesus stopped from stoning the woman.)

2.	⁠Many people gravitate to conservative political beliefs because they fear social change and they **find comfort in a worldview** that rejects modernity in favor of an idealized past. These people **cannot accept that someone can change their physical sex.** Ironically, TERFs have an associated worldview where they derive their personal worth from an identity rooted in being AFAB and fear/hate anyone not AMAB.  To retain this self-worth, they must ideologically reject anyone not AFAB and they see transfems as males. Like conservatives, their fear powers their hate.

3.	⁠Finally, Republican politicians **needed an issue** to bring religious right voters out to the polls after Roe was overturned by the Supreme Court. They also found that political ads about trans girls in girls sports played well with a small group of suburban moms.  That’s why the ads featured hulking shadowy images looming over little girls.

I think fear of us we might also be influenced by a fear / rejection of science among many people.  Our care is science-based, so the haters must undermine that science. This is why we see them focus on the detransitioners and promoting their stories.

I believe future social scientists will study this era and the propaganda targeting us because it is both effective and based on easily identifiable lies. 

We’ve seen hate directed at minorities before in global history. It has been worse before and it could get a lot worse for us before it’s over. Fortunately, it’s actually hard to sustain hatred. It exhausts you. And the propagandists must constantly work to maintain it. Ultimately, this hatred will burn itself out. People will see the truth about us. 

One more thing… while we have to be concerned about potential legislation being introduced in Congress and state legislatures, only a fraction of those bills will ever pass into law. And any law that is passed can be undone by a future legislature.  They are a serious concern, but don’t obsess over them. Most of them are just politicians posturing.  Let’s work with our allies to deal with the few of them that actually move forward and become a real threat."
3,"As a practicing Catholic Christian that's under the trans umbrella: There are a lot of teachings I grew up hearing that claim transgenderism is sinful, many of which I believed at one point (so so glad I don't anymore). Please don't use this list to hate on trans folks OR on Christians. In general, hating on anyone for their identity is a jerk move. While a many Christians do use their religion to justify hateful and harmful actions, there are many Christians who truly want to love and care for others.


Also, I don't speak for all Catholics, let alone all Christians. The following is a list of things I was told in my lived experience.


CW: Transphobic beliefs below. Please take care of yourself and approach with caution.


1) Surgically transitioning is disrespecting/mutilating the body that God gave you: Getting ""cosmetic surgery"" in general is frowned upon, so to surgically alter one's sex organs is even worse. Your genitalia is one of the most precious organs because it allows God to create life (and natural conception to natural death is highly revered). Your body is a temple that is meant to be exactly how God made it to be. Humans are body-soul composite. To harm the body is to harm the soul.


2) Being trans is self-centered: By focusing on your ""preferred appearances"" and your ""preferred name"" and your ""preferred pronouns"", you focus on ""you you you"" instead of on God. Focusing too much attention on *any* identity outside of your relationship with the Lord is sinful because it's a ""worldly distraction"".


3) Presenting as trans causes confusion and scandal: To draw unnecessary attention to oneself and/or to lead others to sin is to cause scandal. By presenting or acting outside of the ""norm"", you draw others' attention away from God on onto yourself. Also, if a man falls for a trans woman or a woman for a trans man, the trans person is ""deceiving"" the other and causing them to be homosexual. These relationships would never work because God cannot create life through their union.


4) Transitioning socially and/or medically hinders you from fulfilling your vocation: If you're trans, you can't get married or enter the priesthood/brotherhood/sisterhood. It also distracts you from the reason God put you on this earth."
3,">I feel the issue with society is we can never progress because thier is always a side that refuses to progress.

Progress is not always linear. In ancient times gay people and trans people where mostly somewhat accepted or ignored worldwide except in one tiny area. In this area a moral text that is guessed to be written 5000 BC included passages that explicitly forbid homosexuality or for a man to act like a woman. 

This moral code much much later made it up north into the Roman Empire somewhere around 300 AD. Before that was common in Roman culture for higher status men to enslave lower status men as ""fuck boys"" Emperor Nero married another man for example. The same is documented for China for Emperors and high ranking officials. 

Then this ideology because that is one named Christianity (unlike the existence of trans people as that is not an ideology but human nature) spread across the world via European Colonialism. 

In school I did not learn any of this and also not from LGBT circles. I first stumbled across this knowledge when I was in a local museum (Europe) and one of the highlights in App guide was a half a meter tall Roman Vase, standing on a pedestal, that had penises and homosexual acts all over it. Later this year in a Museum in Berlin I saw a full room of such artefacts. If these were on display at all in the decades before it definitely was not as prominent and part of the Guide. This may all change again of course...

I wonder what our world would look like today if religion from this tiny area like Judaism, Christianity and Islam that shared this moral code against homosexuality would have not spread across the world. 

Especially given the fact that so many primates (Bonobos, Chimpanzees, Japanese Macaques, Baboons, Gorillas and Orangutans,.. ) engage in homosexual acts so it seems it's logical to suspect that our common ancestors also did so and therefore it was later a part of human cultures across the world. Also it's harmless these species definitely did not die out from it. To me seems like the strict moral panic against this was an extreme oddity in the ancient world only present in Israel. Compared to the rest of the world where the focus for high status men was mostly on make babies for the family clan but other than that have fun... 

There are always people that refuses change. Christianity was seen as a thread to the Roman empire at first. It's in our nature to be somewhat resistant to new ideas. Its not just due to one trait but for example being approximately 16% of people fall into the high openness category. Most are in the middle and also around 16 low on openness. This is believed to be 40-60% based on genes. So there will always be a fight for change because many people are open to new ideas for improving our lives but they can be silenced for a long time by an oppressive regime."
3,"I think a big part of it is the same issue in most societies. While the original intent may have been a message of love and compassion for others and yourself, it’s important to remember that people who are drawn to positions of power, be they a religious organisation, a company or a government aren’t usually drawn to it for the good of the people, but due to a thirst for personal elevation and influence.

With Christianity, The New Testament was written because powerful men of the time didn’t like being bound by certain concepts of the Old Testament. Likewise the Church of England came about because the king didn’t like that Catholicism opposed his desire to divorce.

In the modern era, both religion and politics are cherry picked by those in positions of power so that only the parts that solidify their control and align with their own personal agendas are disseminated to future generations. Meanwhile, parts that would be less favourable are conveniently omitted or underplayed to the future generations until they fall into archaic obscurity and irrelevance.

Even Christianity and Catholicism themselves remind their faithful that humanity can be inherently deceitful and selfish, that is important to be aware of the proverbial snake in the grass.

It’s just that those who blindly follow a faith rarely think to apply those principles to the men (or on rare occasion, women) they look to within the faith.


That’s not just Christianity and Catholicism mind, that’s any organisation, religious or otherwise.

Just because you find solace in the scripture doesn’t mean you should blindly trust whomever insists on reading it to you instead of letting you read it yourself.


Christianity, Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism;
All can be corrupted by the disingenuous who flock to them for the wrong reasons. Its the individuals who hate and in turn indoctrinate others to hate."
3,"Yeah it's so weird. I'm trans and a Christian and the Bible says NOTHING about trans people. The only thing the bible really have to say about gender is that men and women exist (Genesis 1:27) but also that gender in the end doesn't really matter. (Galatians 3:28) Oh, and that one line in Leviticus saying that cross dressing is forbidden, which was part of the old covenant which also included not mixing fabrics, not eating shellfish, and sacrificing farm animals. The old covenant no longer stands because we have Jesus and the new covenant. (Matthew 5:17) The only reason so-called ""Christains"" hate trans people is because their bigoted pastors (false prophets) told them to, and FYI using God's name to spread hatred is breaking the 10 commandments, specifically the ones about ""using the Lord's name in vain"" and ""bearing false witness.""

The only thing the bible POTENTIALLY argues against is male homosexuality, but it is a common belief now that those lines in the Bible were primarily condemning the ancient practice of PEDASTRY and ritual prostitution, not consentual homosexual relationships between two adult men. In addition, lesbian relationships are not mentioned once in the bible, and asexuality (chastity) is promoted numerous times. Both Jesus and Paul the Apostle are widely believed by scholars today to be aroace. So most of the LGBT in the bible either goes unmentioned or is actively promoted. The only thing POTENTIALLY condemned is mlm relationships, who's verses are most commonly believed today to actually refer to pedastry, not consentual relationships between two adults like we see today."
3,"Because it challenges the preconceived beliefs. Some of the core tenants of Christianity including God is perfect and doesn't make mistakes. This is a lazy way to get people to shut up and not question things. Bc if it was made perfect then it shouldn't be changed. It's a way to silence the question why we don't do thin differently. 
But a trans person is (in their mind) the literal embodiment of God made a mistake. God didn't make you the ""right"" sex. It asserts that you know better then God. And if you do things that defy God and we'll nothing happens, well then why don't we all start not following the rules of the religion. Let's wear mixed fabrics! Eat some ham!
Being trans generally demands that society, and gender roles be questioned. Many high control religions don't like when the flock questions, bc it leads to thinking, and gasp possibly discovering that they're outdated views and practices are bad. If a trans person exists it means other trans people might exist, such as their own children. They're child may see a trans person and grow to question why can't boys wear dresses? Why do women have to stay pure till marriage like the Bible says? Essentially the existence of trans people means to them the loss of control. They can't force a cultural narrative, they can't prop up their view points. Bc just by existing they're whole world order can be called into question. It's a very fragile thing, and proof that such a religion isn't a positive. But I do think this is why some people voice the hate especially loud. It's a sign they're scared that they're entire empire is going to be brought down, so they'll scream all the louder to try and silence the threat. Personally I say let's keep them scared. Let's show the kids boys can wear dresses, and girls can play in mud. Let's question our society and culture a determine for ourselves if we actually want to uphold certain views points. Let's expose high control abusive cult tactics, and let's eliminate the power from those shouting the loudest. Let's eliminate it in the easiest way possible by just existing. Lol bc as we all know there's nothing scarier than seeing a trans person just sitting quietly at a coffee shop, chilling on their phone and drinking a latte."
3,"the problem with protestant christianity especially is that there's a lot of room for interpretation in tons of the things in the bible, and they basically either take the word of whatever pastor happens to be running their specific church (who knows how they were educated, if at all, and how bigoted or ignorant they may be), or if they disagree badly enough you leave and find somebody that does see it the way you do.

So, a given pastor decides that the bible doesn't support being transgender so they ""do a bible study"" which basically means cherrypicking whatever sounds like it might support your preferred  viewpoint, and then write up a speech about it and talk about it Sunday morning.

Tons of protestants are literally just convinced that ""in the image of god he created him, male and female he created them"" in Genesis somehow denies the validity of trans people because... it mentions creating two genders? Nevermind that it doesn't actually say those are the ONLY two genders, nevermind that if it did it is clearly not remotely saying you have to STAY male or female if you were born that way. None of that matters, critical thinking doesn't matter, because my pastor said that this is what it means. Also maybe he looked it up in the original hebrew which essentially they think endows him with special magic powers to know EXTRA confidently what it means.

Or they'll cherry pick a verse from later in the Old Testament that says wearing the opposite gender's clothes makes you ""an abomination"" and not only do they not wear anything like the clothes that were worn back then, not only do they not follow ANY of the other guidelines in that same book (don't make clothes from more than one fabric, don't plant two different crops side by side, etc), not ONLY do they have no idea the actual context of that rule or why it is there... they care not a bit about any critical thinking or rationality at all, they just think it means whatever the pastor said it means."
3,"Like I get what you’re saying and you’re right but for me it’s an ACAB situation. I shouldn’t generalize but it’s hard when people voted for the death of women and project 2025 in the name of god. Unless a church is actively calling out fake Christians and working to protect minorities they are part of the problem.

Where are the Christian churches suing for separation of church and state?

I know there are a lot of good Christian individuals but when people bring up systemic problems with Christianity, it isn’t helpful to be like not all Christians...

Circumcision is genital mutilation and it needs to end. Speak out against it. Christians don’t deserve a clean public image right now. They can all shut up about trans healthcare being genital mutilation since they do it all the time to infants who can’t consent. And really they should keep their priests out of kids heads and pants.

And BTW, you’re wrong about Jesus commanding circumcision. Jesus don’t care if you’re cut or uncut. He also said the law of Moses was fulfilled in him.

Galatians 5:6

 
“For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”"
3,"I'm trans (Genderfluid) and Christian. Raised and practicing Episcopalian. The sad truth is that Evangelicals and Catholics have basically gained a monopoly on the modern understanding of Christianity. Please know that there are many queer and trans Christians out there, or simply Christian allies. Because, truthfully, if you actually give a damn about what Christ the Man said, you would know that hate of any kind is not his brand.

It pisses me off to know end to see people twisting a message of love into justification for their small-minded beliefs. I go to church in Guy and Girl mode alternately and have never had an issue.

Unfortunately, I too end up with a deep suspicion of anyone who leads with, ""Well God wants..."" Mother Fucker, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS. The lessons are simple. All ten commandments, the sermon on the mount, all of Christ's teachings, boil down to two things. ""Love God. And Love your Neighbor."" No exceptions. No caveats. That's it. Everything else is debatable. 

Every religion is just some cultures idea of how to be the best possible person. But, if you start discriminating or killing people over it, you're doing it fucking wrong.

In summary. I love you. Any true Christian loves you. Don't let the Bastards get you down."
4,"I'm exactly the same way. I just run hot. I'm not super bothered by the cold the way most others seem to be. I seem to be more bothered by it now on T though, and I want that cozy jacket if it's really really cold. But even in a warm jacket, if you have to be outside in below freezing weather for any amount of time you're still going to get pretty cold, but I used to wait for a good while for the bus after work in evenings in below freezing weather, and even if I had the warm jacket I was still feeling the cold, and my pants were usually not thick enough. Even if I \*was\* feeling the cold, I wasn't bothered by it, and actually liked it. The cold is extremely refreshing to me, and it makes me feel alive, and I love it, and I'm trying to leave the warm part of the country I'm living in now as soon as I can once I'm done with school here, and plan to move to places known for being cold lol. I'm also having the same problem with a too hot room, even though it's winter, and nobody else seems to be overheating. I wasn't going to go home to my parents for my whole month long break, was only going to go for about a week, but my room at my new apartment was being SO warm, it was intolerable and made me so grumpy, and I couldn't stop complaining about it to my friends to the point I was even annoying myself lol, so I just came to my parents for the whole month anyway just to avoid my room at my apartment. I moved to that apartment in August, so this is the first winter there. My roommates keep the heater on, but the temperature on the thermostat seems normal looking to me, and the rest of the apartment feels even a tad chilly still with the heater on. But then I go into my room, and it feels sweltering. My ceiling fan was always on it's highest speed all day and night. I was opening my windows at night so that I could just barely be able to sleep. I had to flip which end of the bed my head was at, because the corner my head was usually in was the warmest area of the room for some reason. Before leaving for my parents, I even bought a standing fan...I bought this fan for *winter*. That is absurd lmao."
4,"Maybe he's just not cold?

Have you asked him like ""dude aren't you cold?"" when you see him out in outfits that seem odd for the current temperature? Maybe his body just runs hot 🤷‍♂️. It's not that cold here at all (like it might get down to almost 40f here and there in winter, but today it was 70f lmao), but even so, I'll be wearing shorts and a tee and be barefoot around the house and my mom will be completely shook at the fact that I am not cold. I was sitting in the living room, and was *too warm*, so I opened a window. It was ever so slightly chilly and breezy out, too cold for me to want to sit outside, but absolutely perfect to bring some slight cool air into the room. But I was still a bit too warm tbh. 20 minutes later, from a completely different room in the house, my mom came to the living room begging me to close the window because it was making her so cold. I closed it, but I could not fathom how she could possibly be cold when the house is so warm. The side of the house she stays on during the day is always so warm to me, to the point where just sitting still there makes me start to sweat. If I turn it down by just 2 degrees, my mom will say she's too cold.

You might be cold, but he might be running extra hot.

Also how long ago did he have surgery? It might be that certain things are still too hard for him to put on and off, or certain things feel to weird against his skin, if he's used to having the layer of a binder between his skin and his outfit, or something like these. His fashion might change over time as the incisions heal more.

I'd just ask if he's even cold at all first lol, before assuming he needs to be wearing something else entirely. If he's not suffering, then why does it matter what he's wearing? If he is cold though, but says he can't afford a better jacket, well now you know what to get him for the holidays."
4,"Express genuine concern, then leave it alone if he says he's fine. I'm someone who will go out in what others deem full jacket weather and be just fine in a t-shirt and shorts with weird thick socks because my feet get cold but the rest of me is fine. I've joked that I must be part frost-giant (and that my Nordic genes are showing surprisingly strongly for how few of them I have lol) because I'm just... Not bothered by the cold the way most people are. It comes with the downside that I overheat too easily (I literally have two bottles of water and a homemade icepack in the freezer because my AC in my bedroom doesn't work right now and I'm \*too hot\* in winter, when it's starting to dip into the negatives in celsius, not sure how that translates because I stopped using the objectively worse way of measuring temperatures lol, my room is well-insulated and my laptop produces heat but most people would not be bothered by the temp in my room), and I know this'll only get worse when I go on T. Some people are just... Not bothered by the cold. And your friend is enjoying having a chest he can show off, I went a bit nuts the first time I tried transtape, I know for a fact I'll be going shirtless in the Arctic Circle (literally) when I get my chest fixed. I'm not gonna freeze myself to death but I have no doubt I'll have at least one hypothermia scare (I'll try not to but shit happens, I know myself well enough to know it very much is more likely than not, though I don't think I'll actually get hypothermic), and I know my friends will be worried, but some of us are just built for the cold. (trying posting this again, it didn't go through the first time for some reason at least on my end so sorry if this is posted twice)"
4,"T definitely makes one hungrier. There are some things like that that generally get said they happen early on on T, but I've found many of those things for myself to not really happen at their highest until some years in. It was maybe 4 years before I was extra hungry all the time. It was maybe 5-6 years in until my libido spiked quite higher than it had been before. Etc. Yet all my other changes happened at the same average pace that they tend to happen at for most people 🤷‍♂️. Go figure lol.

Has he changed anything about his lifestyle recently? If he's exercising more, working out more, started playing sports, etc, then that could make him hungrier.

The amount he eats sounds like me, though not all in one sitting, but more like I'll have a second and third meal for every meal lol. My day is often like breakfast, brunch, second brunch, first lunch, second lunch, third lunch, snacktime, first dinner, second dinner, third dinner, midnight teatime, 2am snack. The amount he ate for dinner is the amount I might eat for first, second, and third dinner, each one being 1-2 hours apart from each other. I'm almost 9 years on T, and tbh don't deliberately exercise or workout, I'm just often hungry every 2-3 hours lol. If I'm going to hang out with a friend, it's not enough to just eat a snack before I leave. Even if I eat a whole meal before leaving, 1.5hrs into our hang and my stomach is growling. I'm so annoying now and insist every time I hang out with anyone that it either be at a cafe, or that it start or end at a cafe, always needs to involve a cafe. I was never hungry so much like this for the first half of my time on T, but around maybe 4-5 years in it was starting to get like this, and at 6-7 it seemed to peak, I was living with my parents at the time and my mom noticed I was eating a lot too. Now almost 9 years in, and I feel like it's starting to very slowly gradually taper away from that again."
4,"I used to get flagged due to having an extra-big clit. (Even before T, just born that way.) But Biden-administration changes to the TSA have made the scanners more ""gender-agnostic"" and they no longer flag my crotch. Extra fabric and the piercing could also explain it. I've gotten my ankles flagged just for minor things like having a sock bunched up."
4,"Sounds normal to me regardless of gender though men seem to do the extremes (shorts in cold weather) more often I find. Lol my oldest though only 13 M insists on wearing tanks there is usually one or more ppl you see walking around in -30c sometimes even -40 in shorts I live in a Central  Canadian prairies type of place. Lol 

I (37F) also hardly wear socks. Currently driving around town (well parked now) no socks but wearing winter boots lol 😆 😅 . Currently it is -22c feeling like -32c. 

I will take out garbage in -40 weather with shorts as well 🤷😅"
4,"I'll go ahead and say it:

dudes rock

in all seriousness, my friends felt the same way about me going out in Vermont (*my first winter here) in a cute sheer top or a thin dress when the weather first dipped below freezing.  What I will say is that I was just walking a short distance from our house to the bar in it, and that I had warm boots at least.  And that I eventually adjusted to at least wearing a coat over my outfits.  That adjustment didn't come from friends teasting, though, I literally was just becoming uncomforably cold and decided that I wanted to survive and be comfy rather that being sexy and showing off my body.  

Your buddy will make the same decision when it becomes important for him.  His body, his safety, his comfort - hell, if he's on T, he probably has more cold tolerance then he used to, so he's probably enjoying the brisk weather like this.  He'll put on more layers if that changes for him.  Survival instincts and all."
4,"Um... No. Trust me... I'D FUCKIN KNOW-

I'm a pothead... like, to call me a stoner is a fuckin insult-

I've put myself in a 8 hour long hotbox in my car that lasted until 7 AM, my car vents were taped off.

I went through 2 fully packed pipes, a full joint smoked through a gas mask, 5 roaches, and a freshly packed bottle bong that night. I stayed in that shit with no fresh air for 8 hours straight and got out with glazed over eyes and a lack of mental anything- I was in a whole other dimension...

I just moved to DC a few months ago and bought a $30 bag of eddies... In my infinite quest for dopamine, I downed the entire bag in one go (1500 mg of Stativa THC) and headed to one of the nightclubs nearby. It was rave night and I started noticing a really fucking intense high kick in... It started out normal but very quickly spired into a sense of dysphoric dread and oblivion. I couldn't tell what was going on, my breathing got extremely unstable, my mind was racing, and the music started to make me tweak tf out..

I started hearing sirens in my head, my chest started hurting, my throat was retracting, and the entire world started warping and turned into a shade of pure crimson red and black..

Turns out, I was going through one of the worlds WORST green outs ever. I ended up collapsing on the sidewalk, unable to breathe properly due to my throat retracting. Somebody called the hospital and an ambulance came to pick me up. I ended up staying inpatient at the ER overnight... I'm still a pothead even after literally seeing hell on earth. I didn't even slow down or chill with the bud- Only difference nearly killing myself did, was make me a tiny bit more careful with edibles.

So yea..."
4,"I'm a cis man and they flag my crotch literally EVERY time. I wear soft shorts with nothing in that area, no belt buckle, no piercing, literally nothing that should flag it but every single time I get a pat down.  I can't speak to why you get flagged so often, but you're not alone. In fact I found this post while searching for a reason that they might be flagging me."
4,"This happens to me a lot, too, and I don't have a piercing or wear boxers. Several TSA agents have told me to wear leggings instead of the perfectly normal, but gender non-specific, pants I usually wear. I think for me, it's a combination of anatomy and fabric. My crotch to bellybutton measurement is long, and I have narrow hips,  which makes fabric bunch up a little. Leggings probably would solve the problem, but I got TSA pre check instead."
4,"I have a teenage boy and a teenage girl (she’s mtf).
My girl is tiny and eats mountains of food daily. My boys is also a big eater but damn that girl is always hungry. She downed a huge meal of chicken (6 thighs) and rice for 3 people, was still hungry. I made a second meal of korean beef & rice for 3. She ate it all. Wanted dessert. We made cake. Huge slice of cake. This was on a Tuesday. She’s an eating machine."
4,"My immediate concern is that if he can forget that he's stoned when eating thanksgiving dinner with his family, he can forget that he's stoned when he decides he wants ice cream or whatever some other day and take off in his car to go buy it.  Personally I had this experience with alcohol, and even though I had my family there with me when I had the alcohol (I only ever drank at thanksgiving), nobody said a thing when I went to go out for ice cream, even though I announced my intentions.  Wasn't until I was halfway there I remembered I'd had some wine.  I was lucky:  didn't get hurt and swore off alcohol forever, haven't had any since.  But if he's gonna keep doing pot he might want to at least set up a way to keep himself away from his car keys while he's high.

Other than that, this is definitely one of the best possible outcomes, and at least you found out about this possible problem before it went badly..."
4,"It might be your piercing.


Earlier this year I travelled to Thailand for vaginoplasty. Departing my home country, I was pulled aside while going through the scanners. I thought that the machine must have flagged my crotch/tuck, but the security woman only felt my hip. I think it must have flagged the metal zip on my skirt."
4,"My grandma had the same tradition (she even made stockings for the dogs) she is passed now, but my mom inherited my and my brothers' stockings I changed my name in April of last year, and when Christmas came around my mom had already fixed my stocking with my new name. When I saw it I nearly started to cry. This year someone mentioned she should fix my stocking and she told them she was way ahead of them.

I am so glad that your family has been so accepting and that your grandma has been so proactive and on board. I hope you have a very Merry Christmas this year."
4,"I live in MN. From the ages 13-18 I don't think I ever wore long pants. Not while waiting for the bus to school, not while shoveling the driveway, basically never unless it was a dressy occasion that required it.
 
One time, freshman year, I was sitting in my algebra class with my denim colored backpack on the floor/resting on my feet. The teacher stopped mid lecture to stare at me, and looking at my feet. Then they started laughing because it took them too long to register that I was wearing shorts, and from their perspective all they saw was the denim bag and then my shins above that and they thought I had just pulled my pants down during class. 

My dad also drove buses for the school district, and one day he overheard a coworker talking about ""this one kid"" on his route that always wore shorts no matter what temp it was. My dad approached him and gave my description and asked if that was who his coworker was talking about, and that's how my dad got to know my bus driver lol."
5,"But the majority of these people are not on reddit! Some might hang out on r/Vietnam, but reddit is not a popular site in Vietnam. So, when you ask a question like ""can a white man have a Viet name"", especially on a trans sub, 9/10 answers will be from Viet Americans who most likely will be against it. You are not getting the answers from a lot more other people who just don't care at all. If you go to Japan, and ask if it's rude for a white person to use a Japanese name, I bet you would get mostly indifferent responses. I actually recall watching a video of someone asking Japanese people if they would get offended, and nearly all said they don't care.

We don't need to look far. A few years back, a white girl was chastised for wearing a Chinese dress to prom. Bunch of idiots harassed her for appropriating another culture. Chinese people were interviewed, and they didn't give a crap, or even complimented her. That's the difference between someone who touches grass and a bunch of terminally online weirdos. It seems like this whole culture appropriation is just out of control in the US mainly.

It's not uncommon for trans people to choose their new name taken from a fictional character they adore. Many trans women choose the name Lara/Laura, from Laura Croft from Tomb Raider. I missed the part where you can only choose white characters' name. I, as an Asian trans woman, choose the name of a character from a JRPG. Apparently, her name originates from Poland. I am as Polish as Lewandowski is Vietnamese. I doubt he, or any Polish nationalists, would be knocking on my door demanding me to change my name.

The common complain I hear from AA is that it's okay for them to take western name to avoid white people from making fun of them. White people taking Asian name is fetishizing. Uhm... If a white person hates Asians, they wouldn't be taking an Asian name. You're barking up the wrong tree. It's like smashing your keyboard because your wifi router malfunctions. And if they fetishize you, they'd just say straight up they want to fuck you. No need to change name. I've faced plenty of racism from all races in the US. Last person I'd blame is some white dude who just want an Asian name, unless he's also a racist scumbag. The worst bullshit I've seen is that some AA will stay away from a white person if they like anime or have ""anime"" name. WTF is an anime name? Goku, Naruto are fictional name. No one chooses those. Seiko? Hinata? Satoshi? Those are actual Japanese names, you fucking idiots. James Bond is a fictional character. People don't stop using the name James. And I also missed the part where white people have to quit socializing with Asians in order to watch anime. Must be some secret unspoken rules among Asian Americans that I wasn't informed of.

There's also this kind of exclusionary vibe to it. Anyone can take German, Italian, Spanish names to be American. But Asian names are automatically ""foreign"" because they don't sound American enough. It's implying that Asian names can never be accepted for an American. An Asian can choose a German name to be American. But reverse cannot happen.

As for you, OP, it would still help your case if you familiarize yourself with Japanese culture. Liking anime is step 1, cultural studying is step 2. You can use both Japanese and western name. Many Asian Americans use their western or ethnic name in different social settings. Hell, I don't see why I should limit myself to just one or two names. If I feel like, I'd find myself a Korean name, then a Chinese name. Somebody else said it'd seem less weird if you have some other connection to Japan. But really, who would be able to verify that? You can just make up a story as yo why you have a Japanese name. Your friend gave it to you before she passed away, and you take it as a memento. Or for example, you choose name Tanaka, because you want to honor your shidoshi, whose name was Tanaka. Whatever you can come up with.

I know the post was too long but I said what needed to be said. I'll keep copy and paste this every time I see a thread like this."
5,"Hi! I used to live in Japan, and I've had this conversation hundreds of times with people of different ages and backgrounds while I lived there. Why? Because I'm white, and my name is Maki. (Well, it was a nickname back then, but not many people knew my legal name, and those who did, didn't use it.)

I started using the name as a kid (long background story I won't go into) when I knew next to nothing about Japan (I never really watched anime nor read manga, and I'm not a gamer.) I wrote it ""Mackie"" back then. The origin of my name is the diminutive of Mackenzie and I chose it because it's gender-neutral (I'm genderqueer), and I preferred shorter names.

However, I'm French-Canadian, and in French most names that end in ""ie"" are girls' names, so when I realized that, I started writing it differently. At first, I wrote it ""Makki"", but during my first stay in Japan, someone told me that in Japanese, it was a word with very negative meanings such as ""terminal"" (disease/cancer, etc...) and ""end-of-life"" (care, decisions, etc.) and suggested that I write it ""Maki"" instead.

During my time in Japan (2006, 2010-2015), I've asked almost every person I've met if they thought it was inappropriate of me to write it this way and if they would have the same opinion if it became my legal name. I begged people to give me their genuine opinion and not say something nice out of politeness (since it's part of the culture to tell white lies, google ""tatemae"" if you want more info.) I've asked people of all ages, and backgrounds, living in different areas of the country, etc. The oldest Japanese person I've asked was close to 90 years old, was from a rural area, and worked on a historical site.

NOT ONE PERSON SAID IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. Most were curious, excited, and honored that I chose a nickname that looked/sounded Japanese, and they even encouraged me to make it legal.

The Japanese family I lived with (a couple in their 70s, their daughter and grandson who were about 35 and 10) even showed me different ways the name could be written in kanji and suggested that I pick specific ones (that are a bit uncommon) for my hanko (a stamp that people use instead of signing their name when they receive mail, at the bank, etc... you can use any name, it doesn't necessarily have to be your legal name, as long as you always keep the same one.) I DIDN'T do it, though. But the fact that they suggested it tells you a lot.

At my school, all the teachers and staff started calling me Maki as soon as they heard that it was my nickname, even though they knew my legal name and I never asked them to call me Maki. (And I wasn't out as trans to most people back then.) One Japanese girl I met who lived in Sweden and visited Finland told me that it was a Finnish name too (I'm not sure if it's a first name though, I know there's a last name spelled ""Mäki"".)

The fact that I spoke Japanese, was well-mannered, and intended to live there my entire life (I, unfortunately, had to leave in 2015 due to major health issues and later on my dad got diagnosed with dementia), and that some people knew my mom practiced Buddhism for a while, etc... obviously might've played in my favor. Also, some people I've asked knew the name originated from ""Mackenzie/Mackie"" so my situation differs from yours.

I never experienced any problems in Japan. However, ONCE a white person from North America who I was acquainted with on social media (and who I believe didn't like me/get my auDHD way of communicating) ranted at me. I admired that person, and they were so cold and made me feel so bad that I considered changing my name again for a while. (I ended up not doing it because my Japanese friends told me it would be silly to change it just because that one white person yelled at me and also a lot of trouble, plus I had paid $550 CAD to change it the first time.) But that's my only negative experience. I also met a French-Canadian woman in her 60s named Maki.

It's not my place to tell you whether it's right or wrong (especially since I'm not Japanese, and don't know enough about you and the name in question) but I hope my experience will help.

*Edited: for clarity, typos, and lemurs... lol*

PS: I forgot to mention that in French, ""Maki"" is also the name for[ ring-tailed lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-tailed_lemur). 😍

5,"I'm still seeing comments from folks like /u/BananeSurBalcon along the lines of ""Japanese folks in Japan says it's ok"" and I'm tired of it.



Here's why its appropriation and a few different perspectives to cosider.



I'm assuming that YOU OP is living in Western country in prodominantly Western society. 


1.) Of course Asian people living in homogenous Asia says it's ok. They DONT experience the racism Westernized Asian folks experience. 


The uncomfortability and appropriation stems from racist history that ASIAN FOLKS IN WESTERN COUNTRY FACE.

Primarily the fact that sooo many Asian folks are bullied and discriminated against BECAUSE OF THEIR NAME.


Then to see a group who historically marginalized us- suddenly take our names now that Anime and East Asian culture is 'cool' is what makes this uncomfortable.



And DONT LINK OUR BEHAVIOUR  to Asian folks in Asia. They DONT experience this racism so OF COURSE they dont care. 


THIS IS IN FACT- Another form of racism that gets perpetuated to folks like Asian Americans. It's termed Forever Foreigner Stereotype.


This is when people do NOT differentiate Asian folks from their 'place of orgin' and why so many people think bringing in Asian folks from Asia is appropriate in this conversation. 


Its why you sometimes see people walk up to random Asian folks and saying shit like Nihao or Konichiwa. Because they see our skin color and expect us to be foreigners.


2.) ""Well Asians take our names hurr durr""


Yes because again, we're EXPECTED TO CONFORM. You can't punch somone, have them fight back, then turn around and say that you were defending yourself. 

Lots of Asian folks on America for example, take English names because it lessens discrimination.


ITS ALSO RACIST TO EXPECT ASIANS TO HAVE ASIAN NAMES.

Historically places like Vietnam has naturally Westernized names becuase of COLONIALISM.
That Vietnamese Emily was born with the name Emily because they were heavily colonized by France for years.

Asian Emily's name can be Emily. 


TLDR; 



Are you planning/ living in Japan or have some connection to this culture other than 'I watched an Anime'? 


Sure, appreciate and take on their culture in that case.


Are you in bumfuck Alabama taking a name from Anime without any further context or connection?


That's weird, cringy, and appropriative.



It's also racist because there's a shitload of racism baked into this discourse for above reasons. You have people who directly experience this telling you it makes them uncomfortable. 




My 2 cents.


""I got it from an Anime character when I was 13""

Is cringe and appropriative. ESPECIALLY if you could have tweeked this name to fit your own culture."
5,"Copy pasting from another comment I made on this topic:

You may see a divide in answers from Asian people who live in Asia and Asian people or people of Asian descent who live in the West. Frequently, Asians in Asia don’t mind because they see it as people taking interest in their culture. They probably haven’t had to deal with being a racial minority, or been forced to interact with someone who has a fetishistic view of their culture. 

But people of Asian descent living in the West do experience being a racial minority. We see our culture being devalued, and experience racial oppression in general. We frequently run into people who fetishize our cultures, and act disrespectfully to us on that basis. So when we see a non-Asian person, especially a white person, adopt an Asian name, we see someone using one our cultures to identify themselves without having to deal with the oppression that we face. It seems disrespectful, like they’re making light of us. 

I don’t think that anyone should have the power to prevent people from picking the names they want. If a white person introduces themselves to me with a Japanese name, I'll call them that name. But I will also be wary of them, be on the alert for any fetishization, and avoid becoming their friend. Because not every non-Asian person who adopts an Asian name is racist, but enough are that I want to avoid it if possible. And yes, an anime name in particular would really make me roll my eyes into the stratosphere and avoid you. 

So name yourself whatever you want, but be ready to accept the consequences of people thinking you might be racist. 

Edit: Do you speak Japanese? Do you know anything about Japanese history or culture? I don't like the appropriation/appreciation framework, but it doesn't seem like you're actually appreciating Japanese culture so much as you like this particular character."
5,"By implying you could educate me, and tell me to educate myself, you implied you yourself are educated in ""racism"", hence why I called you an expert.

You assume I only understand anti white racism? Because I'm talking about it in this particular comment section? I did not bring it up out of nowhere. I brought it up because people here were excluding white people from the discussion based on nothing but race alone. If they were doing it to black people, I would say the same thing.

If I was not curious for knowledge, why do you think I keep replying? You think I do this for the downvotes? I know how most people here are. They love to generalize, if anyone dares imply that white people may experience similar forms of racism, they get angry. I knew it was controversial the moment I started talking about it, yet no one ever explains to me why I'm wrong - you just keep mocking me and telling me to educate myself.

You had the time to bring this conversation SO FAR and still you haven't said anything productive, what is even the point? You love mocking people or what? If you are not here to learn and/or educate, why are you here?

Now, let me educate you a bit:

\- ""anti white racism is a mild form"" - it's not, not everywhere. You just took the statistical average and applied it to everyone, that's called a generalization. Some white people experience a lot of racism, bad one, anywhere where they are a minority

But you still haven't answered me, why are you so bothered by me saying that white people can also be part of Japanese culture? And as such, are also the target audience of the original question? You love deflecting. Making this an issue about me being white and therefore uneducated. Answer my question and we can have a productive convo.

You initially told me I was a waste of time because of my race😂. Anyone can not understand racism. There's also minorities that were lucky enough to avoid racism in ther lives. Why do you assume every minority experiences racism? You just love generalizing, that's why."
5,"So, to answer, specifically, if this is cultural appropriation, I want to give some perspective. 

I am Native American, Mexican, and Chinese. My birth named, which legally I now have as the feminine version, is, like Scandinavian. Literally nobody bats an eye at the name. In fact, I think people sometimes assume I’m white (despite brown skin) because of my very white sounding name. 

What I don’t like about people claiming that using a Japanese chosen name is cultural appropriation is that it’s considered true for all names except white sounding ones. It makes it sound like white is the default. 

I knew two people in high school who were both half-Japanese. One of them had a white name (technically Irish)and the other had a Japanese name. Literally nobody seemed to care or make a big deal about it (granted this was well before cultural appropriation as a term entered common use). Unless you are hyper observant about these things, you’d never tell either of there were at all Japanese specifically. 

And what if a couple had a child and wanted to name them after a Japanese mentor who both personally meant a lot to them. Like, let’s say Masahiro Mifune, a Japanese- American lawyer helped saved a couple’s live and this non-Japanese couple wanted to honor him by naming their son after him. Are they not allowed to because his name isn’t white sounding enough? If his name was Daniel Johnson, there would be zero issues with naming the child Daniel, but there’s an issue with Masahiro? 

In short, choose a name that is meaningful to you.

Sincerely, a non-Scandinavian or Greek woman with a Scandinavian legal name and a Greek inspired preferred nickname."
5,"I've seen many threads like this. Most of the answers always disappoint me.

OP, let me get one thing out of the way first: if it's not racist for an Asian person to use a western name, then it is also not racist for a white person to have an Asian name. It's not uncommon for westerners who live in an Asian country to choose an Asian name, either. We live in a connected world. The words cultural appropriation is utterly stupid. Culture, at least the positive aspects, is meant to be shared and will inevitably spread by various ways. This is even more true today. Halloween? Christmas? Lunar New Year? What's a name to worry about? I am not Japanese, but my response applies to all non-Asians wishing to take an Asian name. I've had this discussion before, so let me tell you.

I was born and raised in Vietnam. It's not uncommon for a Vietnamese person to take a non-Vietnamese name, either as nickname, stage name, or even legal name, just because they like it. They most likely have an interest in the culture where that name came from. It does make some people raise eyebrows, but no where near the amount of backlash like this. If I meet a white person, and they have a Vietnamese name, I'd be even more interested in getting to know this person. Of course, provided they are a decent person and not some weirdo.

You know who else thinks like I do? My family. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc. My friends. They live in Vietnam. When I ask if they ever find it offensive, they just give a confused response. These people live and are surrounded in Vietnamese culture nearly 24/7.

Unfortunately, many of my fellow Vietnamese Americans don't feel the same way. Naturalized VA might feel indifferent about it, mostly. But those who were born here, and raised in American culture, tend to be vehemently against the idea. And let me tell you what I observed from many of them: the majority of them can barely string together a coherent sentence in Vietnamese. They barely know our history. They barely know our culture. They are American, first and foremost, then Vietnamese second or third or fourth. I am not saying that their opinions should be dismissed. However, why should their opinions have more value than mine? My family's? My friends'? Or the majority of the people in Vietnam? Most do not give a crap if some white person chooses a Viet name."
5,">If you’re white and living in Japan, are you suddenly not white? Do you suddenly stop benefiting from pro white racism?

The entire point of these comments is that white vs non-white is extremely Western centric and over simplistic. White people in Japan simultaneously benefit from pro-white racism and suffer from discrimination based on their race. A white person in Japan is less likely to get stopped by the police or refused an apartment than a black person in Japan, but they're also more likely to be stopped by the police or refused an apartment based on their race than a Japanese person. That's why there are white people that are part of racism related lawsuits in Japan. Do you think they need to start listening and stop talking over the non-white people? How does that work? Does the Japanese cop, who has been instructed to go crack down on foreigners, get to lecture them on pro-white racism? Huh?

Of course this conversation is all very silly. We're all Westerners who have never been to Japan and are not fluent in Japanese, so we have a surface level understanding of what happens in Japan and what happens in Japan has little relevance to our lives. In that sense you actually have a point, though it would require a strict delineation between Japanese and Japanese diaspora which I would suspect you're not keen to make."
5,"I think it depends a lot on intent. I know quite a few white people with other culture's names, especially Japanese names, so i'd say it's not. It's getting to be a fairly common thing. If you like your name, keep it. Reddit is a terrible place to ask things like this, as 98% of the people on here are either SJWs or hardcore racist transphobes, and don't actually base their answers on real life.

The people saying it's cultural appropriation clearly don't actually know much about the real world, because a majority of Japanese people, and people generally, outside of Reddit, do not care. The most you may ever get is some weird looks.(Japanese here, born in Japan moved to America, because I know its going to be asked.) In fact, if it's well educated and you know the name's meaning, that's a lot more than most Japanese people expect when a white person says they have a name from our culture.

Personally I think the concept of a name being ""cultural appropriation"" is rather asinine. People have been mixing and matching names from other cultures for a very, very long time, before this generation cropped up and decided that it was ""appropriation."" If they wouldn't care if they saw a Japanese person with a white name, but care if a white person has a Japanese name, then they are quite honestly just racist, and they are the minority, not the majority.

TL;DR: your name is fine, keep it, and you'd be better off asking questions like this on an app/website that has more people that actually live in the real world, and Reddit is not that. Most people in real life are not going to care. The most you will ever get is some weird looks."
5,"I don't usually post and I do not have much time, so my post is a little brief. (read the full thing first please)

I'm Japanese. Born and partially raised there, partly in the US. I would say that it makes me a bit uncomfortable when someone who is not at least partially Japanese has a Japanese name, especially when it's based on anime. (I have a whole thing on people seeing my culture basically reduced to anime).

A couple exceptions I would have is if you just happened to be born and raised there or if you are of Japanese descent.

I would also say, when I do meet someone who chose a Japanese name based on anime, it brings up uncomfortable feelings for me or them feeling uncomfortable around me. I have talked to a few other MtF's at the clinic who did pick Japanese names and I am always interested in find another Japanese trans person (which I have only met a couple). It hurts that the only thing that they know about my culture is anime and nothing else, never visited, learned the culture, or spoke the language.

That all being said, my thoughts are based on MY experiences and how I feel about naming and retaining my culture, but regardless of that, most Japanese people will not care at all. You will just get the ""oh"" with them thinking that's odd, but they will not care. I would probably refrain from saying the why you picked the name portion and it's fine. You do not have obligation to justify why you picked your name, just go for it I guess. You do you, but you will have people who question it and find it, not in good taste. I personally still don't like it and I find it cringy, but it's not like I can stop anyone or can tell anyone how to think. I also feel that you kind of understand that it is appropriation and an issue, but you want a validation to keep it. This isn't an approval to keep the name, but I would just say that if you do, please just be respectful."
5,"**You STILL haven't answered my one and only question... Can you please answer my core question first?**

I am not speaking on behalf of anyone. Only on behalf of myself. I never said how other people should feel. If you think I did, point out where I said it. I used my experience as an example of a similar situation and explain why I think it's beautiful if cultures mix and how I believe it's appreciation.

My core issue is that many people here exclude white people from a discussion targeted at JP culture. But white people themselves can also be a part of that culture. I am not saying I AM part of that culture, I am just saying white people exist that ARE. And they are being excluded - my question has always been WHY?

Let's be real now, there will ALWAYS be people offended by something, regardless of what it is. Just like transphobes being offended that we exist. I was mainly explaining that in most cultures, majority of people are not offended if someone respects their name. And from what I heard from other people in this thread, the same goes for JP people.

This is also my speculation: The only reason you feel uncomfortable is because of the anti JP racism you experienced from white people, yes? So you feel uncomfortable if a person from that race is taking something from your culture that they made fun of, right? But here is the thing... this OP was not being racist towards you. Not all white people are racists. I agree if a racist takes this name, I would feel uncomfortable too. But the OP doesn't seem like a racist to me - hence it feels fine to me. I don't ASSUME stuff based on race like you do. I just see a person liking a name. I apologize if I speculated incorrectly, just wanted to share my current view.

And just please answer my question now..."
5,"Hi, not op but I can maybe try and explain. 

The liking anime part comes from a common thing where people claim they like Japan, but only understand it through their consumption of anime. They have no interest in the deeper culture, its people, nor do they understand that in reality, anime is a very surface level depiction of Japan in general. 

The part about you being 13 is an extension of that; many young kids who like anime don’t tend to understand Japanese culture at a deeper level. You instead get kids who (many times unknowingly!) appropriate Japanese culture by giving themselves Japanese anime names, copying phrases or words (I knew a number of white kids that would say itadakimasu and claim they were Japanese), etc etc. 

While I wouldn’t say these behaviours are the majority, they certainly aren’t rare, and are especially noticeable to POC. Additionally, that isn’t to say you personally partook in these behaviours! However, all of these reasons I’ve listed become associated with the choice in a white person choosing a Japanese name. With the context you’ve given, it’s clear that you are not fetishizing Japanese culture, however, these are the connotations it may carry. I understand that you have decided to spell it the way your country would, which I agree with others is the best choice in this scenario. All the best!"
5,"I am struggling to understand this. In my eyes this is just racism? I understand that people of different ethnicities will experience different kinds of racist prejudice.

But people claim it is cultural appropriation to take on the name of a different culture? I am failing to understand the connection.

If someone who is not Japanese takes on a Japanese name without proper research of the name and the culture this name belongs to, I could see how that would be inappropriate - exactly what cultural appropriation is about.

And it also isn‘t something unacknowledged - or at least it doesn’t seem that way to me as I have seen Japanese people saying it absolutely is ok for you to name your child after a Japanese name for example. I would imagine there to be the same thing for most known cultures.

As long as you do it in a respectful and appropriate manner, I don‘t understand how that connects to cultural appropriation. And OP even asks if what he does may be inappropriate. Taking on a name is a very personal thing. I don‘t understand how this if done properly… would be inappropriate.

What am I missing?

And please… don‘t think of me negatively here. I am asking about these things because I want to know if what I am thinking is wrong. If you tell me these things I have said and claimed up there are wrong, then who would I be to argue against that. I have not experienced these things on a cultural level… I think?"
5,"Right but it’s cultural appropriation of Japanese culture so…. If it’s a talk about anti Japanese racism in terms of cultural appropriation of Japanese culture, We don’t need white people admitting they have no experience with Japanese culture speaking out on behalf of Japanese people.

You seem really upset about being told not to speak on behalf of Japanese people, why is that? Is it the coloniser in you? Or is just that you personally believe it’s your place to tell Japanese descendent they can’t face any form of racism at all because you haven’t experienced it? 

Again, we don’t need you speaking for us as you’re currently doing."
5,"""I have never met a white Tara who prounces their own name correctly"" - is this cultural elitism?

So **you** decide what pronunciation is correct and not?

Just because it's written the same, doesn't mean it sounds the same. Different cultures pronounce stuff differently. If a person's name is written as Tara and pronounced /Tayruh/, **that is how they were named** \- that is the correct prononciation used to name themselves. It's effectively a different name. You are the one incorrectly pronouncing their name in a way they were NEVER named.

Spoken language is what matters, not how it's written. The inspiration for the name may have come from your culture **or not**. But it's irrelevant anyway, because the person's name is not being used in your culture anyway.

Also why are you trying so hard to prove what roots a name has, or what it means? Every culture decides this for themselves. Language, after all, evolves and there are many words that cultures share amongst each other and can mean totally different things... Things one culture gets from another, can evolve separately into something completely new. That's how it is, and you seem to be strongly opposed to it? Stop with this cultural elitism, like you own a word or name. Or is this how you want the world to be? Every culture criticizing others for doing something differently? And fighting to prove what they own.... it's tiring."
6,"So if you see a black person in a porn does that mean all black people are porn stars? No. A trans person doing porn doesn't define the rest of us. 

Also, yeah your boyfriend has been searching for certain porn. He is actively seeking trans plushie porn. Trans porn has been on the rise for years because of people who want to define us exclusively as kink based sex objects for themselves. It is alot more popular in deep red states where anti trans sentiment is the highest. Those kinds of people get off on a power dynamic difference one has over someone not established as a full fledged human. Its the same people who get off to black slave porn because of the power dynamic mixed with bigoted superiority. 

The plushie porn bit is a relatively small kink where women tend to grind on pillows or toys with faces. Not alot of darker stuff there. Blahaj would just be an iconic toy for a trans porn star to use  for it. 

If you want to help him out of that hole he dug himself, start unpacking what kind of things he has been into porn wise. Porn can lead to an unrealistic view of sex and reality as a whole. It would be helpful to discuss with him his porn habits and how it is enforcing some dark thoughts and behaviors and that maybe its time to take a break."
6,"My pronouns and the reasoning behind them:

For some people it's that that they are reclaiming a slur. Someone might say that it uses it/its pronouns because it is trying to reclaim the word that its been called.

For other people, they feel varying degrees of a disconnect with being human/humanness. Someone might not really feel very human and then choose to use it/its pronouns.

For me personally, I have always felt different from society. And I am different. I have ADHD, autism, I'm a transgender man, and I'm aromantic and asexual. I know I'm human and still feel like one, but I wanted a pronoun set that really captured how I know I'm different and I'm proud. Me using my pronouns (it/its and he/him) shows that I'm proud of who I am and whatever that entails. When I chose it/its as opposed to they/them, or some neopronouns, I just felt like they/them didn't feel like me at all. And I knew that I've always loved pillows and wished I could be a living sentient pillow. Pillows don't have to have a gender, and 99% of people don't think of pillows as having a gender, because sadly, pillows are just inanimate objects. So using it/its pronouns allows me to have that connection to pillows while still knowing I can never be one."

We paint the rich and the army in a bad light because they are both things that shout not exist in a civilized society and one group is directly responsible for the need for the other. We wouldn’t need armies if the rich in the us would stop trying to justify stealing resources from other countries and putting everyone in front of them as human shields. Fr, if rich people and corporations didn’t exist we wouldn’t need an army. If everyone has a fair share of resources we wouldn’t have this issue. If everyone in the world had a nuke this wouldn’t be a problem cuz everyone is a pussy when they know that they can be whipped off the planet with a single bomb hitting ground. America dosnt do much invading of countries that have the resources and means to whip out their own land. Cuz they fear a nuke hitting in the area they live and the people calling for their head.

-probably not your boyfriend, for some *inexplicable* reason

Tell him that the trans community is not a monolith; that one trans person- or even several trans people- doing something online does not speak or act for the whole community. I’ve seen straight cis people do all kinds of “abnormal” sexual things (and frankly, as long as everything is consensual, good for them) that I don’t attribute to all straight people. So you one time saw a trans person do something. That’s one person, not the community.

But also, who cares? I once saw a straight girl strap a dong onto a Pikachu plushie and go to town on it. I don’t go around chastising the entire community for sexualizing Pokémon. Anything is a dildo if you’re creative/brave enough (please use common sense about that; nobody wants *that* ER story). As long as there is informed, enthusiastic and unwavering consent from all involved parties, then nobody is doing any harm. If your boyfriend doesn’t want to watch trans people using creative sex toys, then he can watch different content. Simple as."
6,"I've spent plenty of time looking at specifically porn by trans people and I've seen literally one person ever use it in such a way (grinding on it). And this was a person trying to make money who was deliberately sexualizing their trans identity to appeal to chasers. I've also seen a couple of slightly lewd photos where a person was holding one or had it in the background. It is absurd to apply this to the entire trans community, I highly doubt he would've ever come across this unless he was specifically looking for trans porn or plush-related kinks/sex acts. Plenty of cis people sexualize stuffed animals or other child-associated things as well, no reason to pin this on the trans community unless you already think transition is a fetish thing. Also if they aren't exposing children/nonconsenting individuals to it there's really no reason an adult can't sexualize whatever inanimate object they want."

6,"So cuddle parties are a container where people can cuddle but sex is off-limits. Both events require people to ask for enthusiastic consent before anything happens.

White is platonic and no kissing, no touching of a sexual nature, nothing that could be seen as an avenue of sexual gratification.

Pink (or sensual) is basically anything goes but sex. Everyone's pants stay on, but they're allowed to take their shirts/bras off, they can make out, they can fondle someone's chest, lick, bite, and be more playful with each other.

It depends on where you are. Most official cuddle events you will find are white events, but some people will host sensual/pink events, either privately or publicly (although it's often that you have to be vetted for both private and public)."

I was able to get my gender marker and name changed through travis county after filing earlier this year by mail from Brazoria county (south Houston area), and it was signed in October. I was still able to get my passport and social security card changed to reflect who I am so I have a photo ID that matches me and a social security card that has the correct name at the very least.. I’ve heard that amended birth certificates commonly
just have a piece of paper attached to the original stating that both markers have been legally changed.. so I just plan on presenting my court order with my birth certificate if it’s ever necessary. It sucks, but that’s all I can do at this point in time."
7,"Sadly this has gone to both TN state Supreme Court and Federal District Court for TN (stacked with all conservative judges) and it failed for birth certificates.

(And they never allow Birth Certificate gender marker changes.) I even know of some cis passing trans women who were able to change their ID with a sympathetic DMV clerk.

My TN birth certificate is the only thing I have been unable to change and it is quit frustrating as an intersex, cis passing, post-op transsexual woman.

It seems unclear as to how this will impact legal documents. Most IDs are determined at the state level.

What exactly is the scope of the federal government's reach here? 

The only legal documents I've ever had say I'm female or had my birth name are my birth certificate, social security, and driver's permit. My original birth certificate is sealed. My driver's license has always said male. When I applied for a passport, I never ""changed"" my gender marker, I just selected male. Should this bill pass, how do they enforce it? How would they find out I'm AFAB? Who is ""they"" in this scenario, given the government is so decentralized? Who is allocating the time and money?

You may have your driver license with the correct gender identifier on it but you won't be able to board a plane or enter a federal building with it.

Red states could refuse to consider valid driver's licenses that have an ""X"" or similar nonbinary designation for the gender marker, making you liable to arrest for ""driving without a valid license"" if you travel in or through those states and happen to get pulled over. (They could extend that to driver licenses that don't match your assigned at birth gender, but enforcement would likely be more trouble than it was worth.)"
7,"It's critical.  Right now, because of a 2022 executive order, you can change your gender marker without any documentation or evidence.  That's one of the few things that will change pretty much on Day One.

What will it change to?  We don't know.  

It used to be that changing your documentation required you to be post-op, or was simply impossible altogether.  It could very well revert to that.

When and if the Democrats take the White House or Congress back, we are going to be their last priority.

Your social security gender marker and your passport are the two things you need to worry about before the inauguration.  For the passport it's worth it to pay for overnight shipping and expedited service.

Birth certificate and DMV are state issued, so less pressing."
7,"I am a lawyer, though this is not my area of practice. HR is there to protect the company, not the employee. OP should consult a lawyer to see if there is a case.   The lawyer can advise on whether OP should report to HR, or the lawyer will personally consult HR and/or other higher-ups. 

I agree that OP should consult an attorney before going to HR."
7,"„A Mastodon website can operate alone. Just like a traditional website, people sign up on it, post messages, upload pictures and talk to each other. Unlike a traditional website, Mastodon websites can interoperate, letting their users communicate with each other; just like you can send an email from your Gmail account to someone from Outlook, Fastmail, Protonmail, or any other email provider, as long as you know their email address, you can mention or message anyone on any website using their address.”

7,"Ugh. That SUCKS. If you can afford it and haven’t done it already, highly recommend getting your passport before the rules potentially change with the new administration. It’s currently very easy to get the correct gender marker on a passport and can serve as an overriding ID in pretty much any situation (like starting a new job or airline flights that are eventually going to all require the REAL ID driver’s license)."
7,"I applied for an expedited U.S. passport book and card on November 27th (the day before Thanksgiving), and received the passport book on December 13th. The passport card came shortly after that."
7,"Yeah, I’m going to try and update my marker on driver’s license now that social security and passport are updated. I’m hoping they just go with the flow (though they’ve denied me prior). The name change takes so long that I opted to ignore it for now (my state it can take well over 30 days). I’m hoping that with everything done the name change won’t be an issue down the road.

Just have to pay and do it all again later but it is what it is I guess. I’m guessing like you that it’s much easier for them to say “remove this option” than it is to like actually scrutinize name changes etc."
7,"Haha I always think it’s so wholesome. Happened recently for me when I was buying liquor with my brother. They took my ID and then looked at my brother and was like “yea looks like the pic”. They then stared at me waiting for my ID.

I was like “uhm yeah btw that is my ID. I’m trans”. The clerk burst out laughing and was like “I had no idea, I thought this was your brother”.

Funny times when it’s wholesome 🤣"
7,"I found it interesting that you used the short phrase ""existential dread"" in your question, because that is what I've been talking to folks about since election, that we had to recognize it and work on it in order to combat it. I found that taking action was a better solution to facing that sense of foreboding than sitting around wringing my hands worrying about it. We have a lot of work to do in preparation for the eventualities to come, but we can also act on our behalf in small ways to lessen that sense of dread. For instance, I have been spending the past couple months shoring up my local alliances. I looked around and have decided, after a long season of pursuing work elsewhere, that I am good where I am at, that my part of the West Coast, a somewhat blue slice of the country, is filled with resources, friends and allies that should hopefully be there for me, in whatever capacity, when things get rough. On a more personal level, I took it upon myself to prepare myself for flight and/or harassment or even possible arrest by preparing my documents so that they all read the same. Working with people, such as my physicians or work management, people who control my medicines and cash flow, has helped them see that the services and transactional relationships we share, might take on new meaning, so to be ready. A crisis is only as good as the fear behind it.  I can't get worried right now, they are holding their cards too close to their chest and haven't shown them yet. Love, Cat"
7,"Don't just talk to HR, get a photo and email it. Paper trails are incredibly important for protecting yourself and having access to evidence. You don't need to take it further, you don't need to risk your peace by demanding action or anything. 

Just something along the lines of : ""Hey, I saw this up on the bathroom door and while it may be nothing the exclamation mark felt a bit pointed and I wanted some clarification of company policy on bathrooms for my own peace of mind. I also think the original signage was clear enough, and it looked official. A printout like this feels more like a statement than a door sign, and a statement with a broad and potentially aggressive interpretation doesn't quite mesh with a welcoming work environment.

I'm trying not to make a mountain out of a mole hill, this just didn't sit right with me, and I thought I'd bring it up sooner rather than later.

Thanks for looking into it, [name].""

Or if you talk to HR in person, thank them in an email for removing the sign and in the email reiterate what it was and why it is good it's gone."
7,"Both are easy, apply for new passport form - make appointment at local post office to pay and send it in- you’ll want to pay for expedited. 

Social security is form for replacement card - then walk in or make an appointment at your local ss office. They will update and prove it to you - unless name is changing you don’t need new card"
7,"Call or email them for regular updates if you haven’t already. I paid the expedited passport fee and got mine in exactly 2 weeks. You might have enough time. You should have until January 20th. Trump has said he’s going to sign an executive order on Day 1 to undo the current rules for gender marker changes on passports, but who knows if he will stick to that"
8,"Yeah, to be honest, I think the only reason JK really cares about trans. People is because she is literally been shit on for years about not being a feminist because her main female character Hermione Granger has been regarded as a mother figure for Ron and Harry throughout the series Which many journalist and magazine articles have stated as a bad look for women, especially when the movies came out in the early 2000s so essentially, she wants to paint herself as a feminist when in reality she’s not, and never has been I feel like if J. K. Rowling had actually been a feminist when she wrote the Harry Potter books. She would’ve made Hermione a main character because in the late 90s early, 2000s there weren’t a lot of books that had a female protagonist. The only book I can actively think of that had a female protagonist was Stephen King’s firestarter or Carrie but that made sense for someone like Stephen King, who was always provided himself as a leftist or democrat, which is very much shown in his writings where I feel like J. K. Rowling is more of a showman who wants to pretend she has beliefs and values when in reality she just follows the grain."
8,"Disney was NEVER better than this, they were just temporarily pretending to be...our biggest ally in the form of a media company right now is Warner Media, they have TONS of shows with LGBT+ rep (even kids shows) and rarely cancel or delist them. Netflix USED TO be that good but now they're buckling to bigots and beginning to cancel and delist more LGBT+ friendly programs. Disney has ALWAYS done that...they canceled The Bravest Knight when they bought out Hulu, they canceled Owl House early, they delisted Willow, they cut at least one queer scene out of Turning Red, and they cut the queer characters from Gravity Falls and then cancelled the show immediately afterward."
8,"Can't say I'm surprised at all.

Don't forget that Disney recently blocked a episode titled as ""The Gatekeeper"" from a Marvel TV Show called ""Moongirl & Devil Dinosaur"", that was going to show another Transgender character named Brooklyn who's a a reccuring character but never explicitly said to be apart of the LGBTQIA+ Community as a Trans Girl along with a Non Binary Character and Teammate Tai that was both trying to play a Woman's Volleyball game for their HS team vs other team.

Please Note that the episode focuses on Transgender Athletics even tho Tai was mostly forgotten by the ""villain"" of the episode and only paid attention to Brooklyn being a Transgender Woman on a Woman's Sports Team. 

The episode is available, but you have to search for it online or on reddit to watch it. I will say that the episode (""The Gatekeeper"") was pretty good, such ashamed it was blocked due to how the state of the US is going when it comes to LGBTQIA+ People.

Also want to clarify for anyone who still think Non Binary Folks are Woman Lite, is wrong cuz Non Binary People are under the Transgender Umbrella but not everyone who is Non Binary sees themselves as Transgender. 

Anyone can be Non Binary and doesn't matter what their Biological sex was, Gender Identity is not always align with sex and can show any forms of Gender Expressions and should not be pressured to showing Androgyny in order to apart of the Non Binary Umbrella."
8,"They are cowards especially since I saw the first 4 episodes and it already has “certain subjects” that are heavier topics. The first episode focused on “the coach’s kid” and depicted anxiety and feelings of inferiority and pretending to be ok when you aren’t. The second episode’s focus was on the umpire/teacher and his feelings of loneliness and regret for not taking the next step in his relationship. This episode also depicted online dating and rejection. The third episode dealt with another middle schooler who had financial worries in her single parent household. She has to find ways to earn money for her own dues to be on the team and acts like a parent and mature for her age. Showing exhaustion from trying to balance her life. PLUS, there was a depiction of a teenage party and the garage had a haze in it. You can’t tell me that wasn’t smoke of some kind. The fourth episode was about single parenthood and trying to balance everything and put on a happy face for everyone. Again there is the same party scene but when the mom shows up. And you cannot tell me that half the teenagers don’t seem influenced on something! One sounded like she was slurring her words. And there was mention of “upstairs” at a party. So, their argument is even more bs because they are not “letting these parents discuss certain subjects with their children on their terms” i.e. implied underage drinking, teenage parties, and potentially implications of Mary Jane."
8,"Lmaooooo I agree!! And I never even liked Harry Potter! I never understood the hype because I thought it was so mediocre and boring compared to other fantasy/non-fiction series. 

The way she tries to paint all trans women as sexual predators is disgusting. ContraPoints on YouTube does a great job tackling JK Rowling."
8,">When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline

I love that it was easier for Pixar to have a movie LITERALLY about a girl getting her first fucking period, but we can’t have some trans character being normal in a movie.

I hate it when Disney does this shit. I’m a professional animator and it’s disappointing having a job at Disney/Pixar be my dream job ever since I was a kid, and then just growing up and understanding the amount of contempt the employer you’re trying to work for has for you. I’m aware they were never anyone’s friend, but it really is upsetting when there’s a difference between them having complete and utter apathy for showing stories about non white non heteronormative characters, and then whatever the fuck this is where they just outright are trying to tell you “If we hire you, understand your place in the machine, you insignificant fucking trans worm.”"
8,"Unrelated, but is anyone else just not intered in Disney Animated movies anymore? Wish, Moana 2, Strange World, all have been so forgettable and bland. 

Meanwhile DreamWorks put out The Wild Robot, which was so beautiful. Sony is making Spider-verse. Arcane is a gem. Theres just so many better and unique animated films and content out there than whatever Disney is making anymore. 

Practically every animation studio is adapting for the better, meanwhile Disney just feels so generic."
8,"At my campus, the fraternities and sororities seem to be really feared and hated by the LGBTQ community. Do you agree with the fear around Greek life? Does it depend on the frat, and do/have you gotten flak from rival frats (sorry idk completely how it works lol)?"
8,"There are no valid JK Rowling opinions that have any baring in a reality otger than her own...which appears to be completely deluded...just like all those who would line up to huff her farts simply because she hates herself and denies any potential actuality of any reality otger than her own...as if what she says actually matters...and, people believe her opinions matter...why? Because she write a book? I wrote on toilet paper and flushed it once...I do the same thing with her opinions and anything she says. She gives redheads a bad name. As being a ginger is my birthright, on behalf of gingers everwhere, si.ply because Rowling is a crotchedy old bitty, we denounce her ginger status and cast her into the abyssmalness that is all the other idiots just like her who think that their opinions matter wgen it comes to other people's loves that have no connection to her own ability to live and not be affected by that which she appears to have personal issues with...which is Trans folks...apparently.


She wrote a book. So what. I was written about in a pubkished book. I signed an nda. Can't say what book. Why? Because my opinion mattered...still does. Still relevant. Rowling is not. Money don't mean sh*t...and, that is all she is about...money."
8,"you are heavily misunderstanding the film. 

The film explores many complex themes including identity in a mind, body, soul perspective, obsession/control and power and most of all its puts plains and simply for cis males how Gender and sexuality are fluid concepts and that the essence lies within ; alongside the horrors of living in a body that doesn’t align with it and the importance of body autonomy.

I don’t how you did watch that film and ended up with that conclusion.

Pedro Almodovar is also one of the most critically acclaimed queer directors, excelling at portaying classic queers sterotyopes alongside complex and relatable characters.

Sorry but as film aficionado and fan i found that take baffling

Edit: The comment above was talking about a different film (the skin i live in)"
8,">A spokesperson for Disney confirmed that the story arc was removed and provided the following statement to THR: “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”

Ah, right. So, just to be clear, Disney is **OK** with showing:

* Death
* Physical & emotional abuse of children & animals
* Colonization, pro-monarchy, & pro-capitalism rhetorics
* Racial stereotypes
* Class disparity (in the form of ""poverty porn"", i.e. to build character & develop sympathy without actually addressing the issue)

But is **NOT OK** with:

* LGBTQ+ representation"
8,"No need to bring up hypotheticals about time travel 

No one needs to continue to enrich this wench from now on.

This means we must NOT support the new Harry Potter show they’re making. We don’t need to go back in time to not invest Harry Potter but please let’s not enrich this woman further with her new show. May that shit flop."
8,"Disney & Pixar pulled the trans story from the Win Or Lose movie.  
  
Transfolk are the people that Disney & Pixar do not talk about.

Rather sad as I felt appreciated there, but then again, I am no longer there; so how appreciated was I really?

So Disney removed me a trans person from the studio lot and within 6 month removes a trans character from a movie.

I cannot go back, cannot change the past nor would I. 

Trans people are real, we exist. I am way beyond the point of no return. 

If that means that anyone wants to pretend that I do not exist then so be it. Anyone who feels that way is probably not the type of person that I want in my career or life anyways."
8,"Im a trans man in a sorority (I’ve since graduated but im still a Sister™) I almost got kicked out for transitioning because the gender policy was hideously outdated (had a meeting with the National President about the policy because it was set to affect the memberships of nonbinary and gnc members too, not just the trans men) actually had to beg the chapter president to not say anything/report anything to Nationals about my identity so I could be allowed to take a little that semester before the policy changed. My chapter had my back though despite them not being the best at using my pronouns or preferred name at first."
8,"Literally the entire Harry Potter series is chock full of sexism, racism, ableism, etc.


Rowling was always like this."
9,"Depends on context. ""Dude, look at this"" is neutral, while ""I'm a dude"" is gendered. ""Bruh"" as an expression of disbelief is neutral, but bro is gendered. ""Spill the tea sis""  is neutral, but sis is gendered. Guys is neutral when referring to a group like ""guys, come here!"""
9,"im not arguing metric vs non metric, so feel free to use freedom units if you want


im talking about subtracting an r.


if milestone was constructed by subtracting an s from miles, then arguably i should be able to construct kilometerock by subtracting an r from kilometer.  :p"
9,"By your own logic it should still be kilometerrock with two r tho, since you take away the s from miles, which is the plural of mile. Because then you'd have to take the plural of kilometer as well, which is kilometers, and if you subtract the last letter of that, the s in that case, you still have kilometer. :P"
9,"I think ""Guys"" really depends on the context. ""Come on guys"" is a lot more neutral than saying ""That group of guys"". 

Terms like ""bro"" can be neutral (especially if it's women using them) but are pretty gendered. I find myself calling girls ""dude"" or ""bro"" a lot though just out of habit. I've accidentally called my dad those a couple times. Male is usually viewed as the default, which makes them a bit more neutral.

I feel like ""sis"" or ""girlypop"" are very gendered though. I can see some queer guys being cool using them but if you called an average, masculine presenting guy ""girlypop"" I think he would punch you in the face."
9,"assumes it's not miles vs. kilometer :p


i.e. miles + stone = milestone


means kilometer + rock = kilometerock"
9,"right, thanks for the correction.  of course you can have kilometerocks, s on the end.  the platonic singular thing is the kilometer.  it can be singular because it's not constrained by there being physical kilometerocks.  if the romans hadn't constructed milestones we would be forced to deal with two r's."
9,"have a cat show up on your stoop. Bring cat to vet to see if it's chipped. Be unable to find an owner for the cat. Become the cat's owner.  
  
I now have three cats."
9,"s is energy in particle physics.  r is almost always distance.


milestone comes from a roman mile, apparently, which was 0.921 miles.  if we use mile as in its modern usage, we get an extra s.  


between any two milestones, they may be separated by one roman mile or multiple roman miles depending on which are selected.  there are far more pairs that are separated by more than one mile, just from combinatorics."
9,"I think it’s a generational thing. I only consider dude, guys, and bruh (not bro) gender neutral. But I know younger people I work with consider almost everything like bro and sis neutral."
9,"This. I and almost everyone I know use bro all the time. My cis roommate refers to her friends as ""bro"" regularly even though I don't think she's friends with a single guy. It really depends on the person. Most folk I know use ""bro"" neutrally. And some of them use sis neutrally too, though that's less common."
9,"I mean, in some parts of the United States ""you guys"" is a form of ""y'all"".  (I use both.) I understand that bro is typically used to refer to men and I've rarely even heard sis. I can also see mate being masculine with love being a feminine form (NOTE, I have little experience with such other than TV). Pal is usually masculine.   
However, I've used bro, guys, mate, and pal to my friends and family regardless of gender. HOWEVER, should someone correct me the right thing to do is to apologies and try to stop using such terminology around that individual."
9,"Oh honey, you're kidding, right? 😄

I live in Jersey City. We don't play games out here. You have to know how to fight whether you're trans or not. Maybe where you live, pepper spray is gonna to get you through the day. Here it's illegal and it's only going to get you beat harder. 

And like I said, pepper spray isn't going to help you walk tall and avoid the issue to begin with. You need to know what you're doing so that the rest of the world can sense it."
9,"That's not correct, in fact you yourself set up said physical definition right from the start by asking if someone would be in favor of using kilometerrocks over milestones. That in return means it's supposed to be the metric version of a milestone which wouldn't just be something like a metaphor. Heck, the person who answered you even used a plural of kilometerrock already so there definitely can be more than one. :P"
9,"No I don't. Now I'm in my 40s so it might be a generational thing, or a regional thing, but personally if I use a term or have a term used on me that designates a gender then it's not gender neutral. Guys, bro, sis are all gender defining terms, so for me personally, they would be gendered, and as a transgender woman, I honestly hate being labeled a dude, guy, or bro. 

This is, of course, only my personal stance, and other people can and will have different opinions, and that is okay."
9,"Language is fun and certainly not black and white. A few different things are true:

1. These terms can be used neutrally, without implying that you intend to gender the person you're referring to. There are plenty of examples of this (like you use) and it's pretty widely accepted.
2. These terms can be gendered, and used with the intention of deliberately gendering the person you're referring to. They still serve this purpose frequently.
3. These terms can and are used to maliciously misgender people, using the motte-and-bailey approach of intending usage 2 (above) while claiming to be using usage 1 (above) if called out on it.

2 & 3 can make trans people in particular extremely averse to 1 for hopefully obvious reasons."

Edit: For clarification, Amy Coney Barrett was not on the court for *Bostock v. Clayton County*, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was.

And if she feels really she can reach out .. there are helplines, for example 

translifeline.org Its trans people there. It may be necessary to call a few times until someone answers.

thetrevorproject.org/get-help-now/ They also have a chat and further resources like Trevorspace so they could be accessed from anywhere. It may be possible to use a proxy in case. And someone who worked there said they may also help people of all ages.

thrivelifeline.org/ They also have a chat

10,"Yeah Barrett was not on the court for *Bostock*. We don’t know how she would’ve ruled in that case, but we know Roberts and Gorsuch went our way(Gorsuch writing the opinion, as you said). That’s why I say Barrett is surprisingly moderate. She ruled in our favour here, and she was somewhat open and good faith during the oral arguments in *United States v. Skrmetti*."
10,"Ooooh I understand now - “those three” who wanted to hear this case are the same three who dissented in *Bostock*. I thought the three you meant were the previously named Barrett, Gorsuch, and Roberts. Now all is clear. 

Agreed that Barrett has, thus far, been less of a dumpster fire than expected. I’m not holding my breath on this one but still."
10,"I’m confused? Barrett wasn’t on the court for *Bostock,* Ginsburg was. The three dissents were Kavanaugh, Alito, and Thomas. Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion - in our favor - with Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan."
10,"I’m not, but Gorsuch and Roberts did rule in favour of LGBTQ+ people in *Bostock* in 2020, with Gorsuch(the more conservative of the two) actually writing the majority opinion. Barrett wasn’t on the court then, so we don’t know how she would’ve ruled. This is definitely a welcome sign though."

11,"Binary sex is actually rare, and its even more rare to have chromosome associated sex, and exclusive to mammals to have to specific type of chromosome associated sex that we do.

Here's a few examples I can rattle off:

There are multiple parthenogenic, all-female populations or even entire species of lizards.

Most wrasses, a large group of fish, are sequential hermaphrodites, having a life cycle that involves them switching from female to male at some point.

Many other fish exhibit similar sequential hermaphroditism, but as a response to environmental triggers- clownfish being the most famous example.

Many or even most invertebrates fall completely outside of male/female. Hell, the most documented animal in the world is the nematode C elegans, a common lab animal. Its sexes are hermaphrodite and male. Hermaphrodites typically self fertilize, and males are exceptionally rare in nature, existing to force gene flow and crosses.

And honestly.... even mammals and humans fall outside of the sex binary a lot of the time. binary sex is a complicated sequence of thousands of signals that generally work in coordination. But the moment you end up with any disruption to one of those signals, you get traits that seem ""mismatched"" by the binary standard- female lions with manes, male humans with breasts- that aren't even particularly rare! They're just an accepted part of the variation of the species."
11,"Reptiles, fish, insects and other animals have more malleability generally. 

I don’t know of any example of a mammal that can do anything to alter its sex outside of lions. Female lions can take on secondary sexual characteristics of male lions, and integrate socially that way.

Mammalian biology is just generally more rigid. We lose a finger it’s gone, and we often look fairly consistent through stages of development. Fish, reptiles, and insects sometimes experience dramatic physical changes in their lifespan, becoming nearly unrecognizable.

As far as gender as a social role, that can happen due to social issues primarily. Like if a pack or group is not balanced the way it normally would be. Otherwise, mammals—whose social behaviors and emotions are more complex than reptiles and fish—are generally more rigid in their role based on their sex. 

Birds also exhibit complex social behaviors and relationships, but they are more closely related to reptiles with basically no relation to mammals. Their brains are capable of social and emotional complexity, but still are unique from our own. Many birds have committed and even monogamous relationships — though without the same sexual complexity of mammals, who are more likely to engage in sex for pleasure. Still, birds can form intense social bonds with the same sex and have homosexual relationships. Birds also sometimes may play a role of the opposite sex than what they are genetically."
11,"No, because gender is a human social construct.

*Sex* however is much more interesting in the animal kingdom. Some species of fish and insect can reproduce asexually, or turn into the opposite sex. Lots of same sex bird couples have been reported, across different species. Some animals may exhibit non typical behaviour for their sex. Then of course, intersex individuals in species with non-typical hermaphroditism exist, due to genetic or hormonal abnormalities.

But I don’t think you can compare that to the spectrum of gender in humans, because so much of how we define gender is a social construct or contract, instead of pure instinct or genetic drive."
11,"Yes. Basically all protists.. Many funguses.. And some animals who are true hermaphrodites and of course animals who reproduce asexually they do exist. Not to mention ""Haplo-Diploid Systems"" such as those of bees... The worker bees and the males are similar classes of bee. While the only female who lays eggs is the queen and is much larger and lives much much longer... If humans had this system... The average person would live around 60 to 70 years.. While the Queen would live something like 1350 years and also the Queen would be ultra powerful compared to the average person... Easily being able to hit-kill a person. The men who would have sex with this absolute unit of a woman would be very intimidated. The Queen bee is very much like a God to the bees. If humans were like bees... Our society would be separated like this: Ordinary people and the Queen. So we wouldn't have gender roles... Every non-queen person would be equal."
11,"Gender is a artificial technology. Animals don't have gendered clothes, animals don't have gender roles, animals don't have gendered bathrooms, animals don't have gendered pronouns. 
Sex outside of binary is found in even in human beings, called intersex people. Snails change their sex based on temperature, population density or social cues. Other animals that change sex include Clownfish, Hawkfish, Sea Bass, Humphead Wrasse, Butterflies, Cardinals, Cardinals, frogs, snakes, turtles. 
Plants have bisexual flowers meaning flowers having both male and female parts.
Intersexuality has been reported in mammals, fishes, nematodes, and crustaceans.
Mushrooms have 28000 different sexes."
11,"Gender is more of a social construct made by humans. Biological sex would be more accurate. Most other species just have male, female, and intersex, like humans. Some species are entirely intersex/hermaphrodites, like snails. Birds and reptiles have cloaca's. And some species reproduce asexually. I'm not a professional, so don't take what I say as fact."
11,"I would argue any animal that can reproduce asexually 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction

As well as animals that can change their sex
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_hermaphroditism

Also a favorite example is ""lionesses"" who will undergo hormonal changes and thus change to their secondary sex characteristics to fulfill the roles of a lion within their pride. They cannot reproduce with lionesses but will grow a mane, hold the appearance of a lion and fulfill the same social roles that a lion would have within the pride. To the point where they are mistaken for a lion until it is discovered they lack testes."
11,"All animals are outside of the gender binary because gender is a human invention.

If you're talking about sexual dimorphism, the majority of mollusks, earthworms, and tunicates are capable of producing both types of gametes.

However, it's worth noting that even among species that do not, the biological binary itself isn't as rigid as it appears.  Biological binaries are human shorthands for categorizing a vast array of biological phenomenon, and one of the major tasks of biological taxonomists of the past half century has been deconstructing centuries of scientists' culturally biased projections onto the biology of sex.

Last but not least, humans, while obviously, not as fluid as mollusks, do, in fact, exist outside of a sexual binary.  There are XY humans who have borne children, and XX humans who have sired children.  An estimated 2% of the human population is intersex, and that number is likely higher given the impossibility of assessing exactly how many people simply don't present as such externally."
11,"Throughout mammals and birds, it's actually fairly common for gay animals to adopt abandoned or orphaned babies. To the point where there's been speculation that it's actually an evolutionary advantage to have a gay relative. they make great additional parents to make sure the next generation survives.



Lots of cases of intersex animals developing both male and female characteristic. 


There's a particular  population of lionesses in africa that have a tendency to grow manes and begin displaying what's traditionally considered ""male behavior.""


Speaking of kitties, a couple of years back there was a kitten what popped up in a few news stories because it was discovered it didn't have a sex. It had no internal OR external sexual characteristics whatsoever.  First of it's kind documented.


Clown fish are all born male and then the largest ones change to female as they age.



Basically, nature is pretty bad at making binaries. There's pretty much always a fuzzy grey area."
11,"There's plenty of sex variance and same sex attraction in the animal kingdom but gender is a much more human social concept that does require a certain level of society and self awareness that most animals don't have.    
Gender doesn't mean much without language if we take the social construct definition. At least so far it hasn't been proven there's like, and observable physical component to trans identity, so without language and self awareness I don't think animals can even express gender as we mean it, at the max just roles based on sex.     
Edit: the gender binary is very social as a concept. It's changed a lot over the millenia of human society. Native Americans recognize a third gender for example.     
If being trans is caused bya biochemical reason, then there's no reason to think ""born in the wrong body"" can't happen to animals outside of humans. If we're talking only about gender roles and gender in the social sense, then without language and society it's very hard for that concept to exist in aminals and if it does it's very different then how we perceived it I feel."
11,"Oh, yes, the white-throated sparrow!  Brown striped birds are submissive and nurturing, and white striped birds are aggressive and dominant.  White stripes can't produce viable offspring together, and while brown stripes *can* mate together, they're not that into each other.  As a result,  the species does basically have 4 sexes existing along two separate binaries.  It's really fascinating and the study of the birds is the closest thing we have to understanding how sex chromosomes evolved in the first place."
11,"You will find gender roles in various mammals.  Every animal has to have an internal gender tag to tell its sex so that it knows who to mate with.

Some fish can change sex in response to the environment.  But, in higher creatures like dolphins, there are still gender roles, and even adolescent male dolphins will act very similar to human teenagers.  Even octopuses have got darker skin to indicate the presence of testosterone, and light skin to show estrogen.  Octopuses belong to a different family, but act remarkably similar to humans in terms of gender role."
11,"Not exactly true. Examples that i can think about are chickens and lions and a lot of ape species having very evident gender roles and cases where there are individuals that behave the opposite of what their biological sex would tell us even if is not a need at the group, with wolves can happen as well if I'm not remembering wrong. Gender is a social construct, that's true, but not exclusively human. Maybe not that complex or that rigid established but social animals are called like that because they have their own societies and with that roles, and in a lot of them that includes gender roles. 

What is more hard to defend is that if they are conscious of it, if it is intentional or not(which i doubt it matters anyway as long as there is no rejection to those individuals most of the time) because the concepts of identity and self awareness is another different thing, way more complex and, yes, mostly exclusively human."
11,"I 100% understand what you are asking but gender is a social construct, it’s entirely a human phenomenon.  Animals have biological sex, they do not experience gender whatsoever. 

Sex within animals is often quite fluid though, some forms of fish are able to change sex, the roles of “sex” can also vary greatly between species, penguins and seahorses immediately come to mind"
11,"I am deeply disturbed by the fact that you are implying misogyny or lack thereof is instinctive. Whilst empathy is a more instinctive trait, (however it can be learned to be stronger or weaker), which does effect how humans handle “us vs them” tribalism, misogyny itself is a learned behaviour, as is any other prejudice. 

However, I think what you’re trying to say is that taking HRT change a person’s instincts? 

I agree, however there’s no real comparison in the animal kingdom, except for maybe a few lab rats somewhere. It’s an inherently artificial behaviour change, only possible because of modern medicine. I don’t think you can compare it to what happens in nature because animals don’t take HRT by themselves. Instead behaviour is either driven by genetics or learned from their environment. 

Seeing as you can’t learn not to be trans, it’s fair to say you can’t learn it. So the direct comparison in the animal world is genetic driven behaviours, say instead of a female chicken learning to crow like a rooster for food. An genetic driven behaviours don’t change with identity."
12,"When the school shooter is MAGA: 🙈🙉🙊

When school shooter exists: ""OMG! They're trans!! See, it's a mental health issue! We need to stop our schools from teaching pronouns!!""

And btw, two school shooters have been MAGA. The Parkland High School shooter (2018) who still supports Trump from prison, and the Oxford High School shooter (2021) who Trump's own shooter idolized."
12,"i think they mean more so that the media cycle drops these stories as soon as they happen because they are treated like natural disasters and not tragedies that have consequences or can be prevented. those affected will absolutely remember, but then the next one will happen — and then the next, and the next, until every american is one degree of separation from a mass shooting. i say this as someone who’s friends with two school shooting survivors (one who survived parkland and another who survived a lesser known school shooting in indiana), the media treats these tragedies like they are an unfortunate inevitability and we must just accept that this is life. it is unbelievably horrific. but the sad truth is that it’s by design that the larger public will just ‘forget’ and move on."
12,"And that's the point and the danger when local authorities don't stand up for us. That shooter *still* was never proven to be trans. All of the evidence was just that the police negligently said they didn't believe the shooter was trans but were investigating the possibility, anyway, and the fact that the shooter had a masc leaning pseudonym to sell their digital art. All other 'evidence' was rapid internet disinformation and trashy news rags.

Considering that internet trolls have been shouting for the last 2-3 years that every school shooter is trans in hopes of spreading disinformation I'm not unconvinced the police chief wasn't just going along the same lines of 'my qanon website tells me there's a spree of trans shooters so we need to investigate this possibility' and it only fueled the usual disinformation that already existed."
12,"It was the same for gay people back in the 1970s:


The shooter is transgender. Or the shooter used to be transgender. Or the shooter was going to be transgender. Or the shooter was thinking about being transgender, or had a neighbor who was transgender, or had a pet that was transgender. 


But there was something about ""transgender"" that made this person start shooting people. There must be, because why else would they have done such a thing?


I'm really pretty fascinated at the ability of people to lay anything that happens on some minority group. For a while, all the hurricanes that were coming by and causing a lot of damage... Happened because of same-sex marriage. 


”If America would only get rid of same-sex marriage, then we wouldn't have these destructive hurricanes anymore."" Well, we didn't get rid of same-sex marriage... So if we just get rid of transgender people, all will be right in the world. 


Or something."
12,CONGRATS OMG AWW 🥰 I LOVE THAT
12,"The more reporters ask if shooters are trans, and the more people that spread the narrative, the more people will think that the narrative is grounded in some legitimate reality even if there’s literally no actual reason to be discussing if this shooter was trans. If people keep assuming or asking if school shooters are trans, there has to be a reason right?"
12,"What really frustrates me. Is that even if the shooter was trans it means nothing. There’s been literally hundreds of school shooters over the last 20+ years and the vast majority are straight white cis boys. They’ll completely ignore that, and focus on the fact that one out of those literal hundreds of people one is trans. And then pretend that being trans is the cause of shootings."
12,This post is the first im hearing of this shooting. The shooter wasn't actually trana right? People are just saying they were to stoke emotional flames?
12,"They want to have something to demonize that a lot of people don’t have direct experience in their lives with so they will turn a blind eye. Basic scapegoating 101. They are just doing whatever they can to avoid the reality that the shooter had access to a gun somehow and the gun cause an event of mass violence yet again in this country. The fact that the shooter was a girl just so happened to line up with a lot of close-minded thinking that “men are aggressive”, negating the fact that women and anyone else regardless of gender identity can feel and exhibit aggression. There may be other underlining factors too, such as parental oversight and mental health, but they are simply doing whatever they can to protect their interests while attacking what they fear and to justify they public displays of hate and transphobia. 

Unfortunately misinformation (especially on the former bird app) is rampant, but we need to stay vigilant and have our communities backs. Stay safe everyone! 🩷🤍🩵"
12,"If the shooter is a cishet white man they're a lone wolf, let down by society and pushed to the breaking point by others. We obviously need to push back on [insert minority here].

if the shooter is anyone else it's all part of a political agenda and dangerous trend. We obviously need to push back on [insert minority here]."
12,"They did this with the last school shooter too, even tried it with the trump shooter."
12,Omg i thought it said 'intuition' already lol
12,"It's honestly kind of scary that Republicans are claiming every school shooter is trans now. They're building a narrative. Doesn't matter if they get smacked down every time. Eventually, all the morons will start thinking, ""Gee, sure are a lot of trans mass shooters these days,"" regardless. And there are a lot of morons in this country."
12,OMG. I'm not crying! You're crying! 😭
12,"Yep because the onion knows what's up. And no one, outside of a select few, really see the problem with shootings like this. but also oof"
